description: ! 'This module provides Haskell binding for <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/
  Eigen C++ library>.


  Eigen is versatile.


  * It supports all matrix sizes, from small fixed-size matrices to arbitrarily large
  dense matrices, and even sparse matrices.


  * It supports all standard numeric types, including std::complex, integers, and
  is easily extensible to custom numeric types.


  * It supports various <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/group__TopicLinearAlgebraDecompositions.html
  matrix decompositions> and <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/group__TutorialGeometry.html
  geometry features>.


  * Its ecosystem of <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/unsupported/index.html unsupported
  modules> provides many specialized features such as non-linear optimization, matrix
  functions, a polynomial solver, FFT, and much more.


  Eigen is fast.


  * Expression templates allow to intelligently remove temporaries and enable <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/TopicLazyEvaluation.html
  lazy evaluation>, when that is appropriate.


  * <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=FAQ#Vectorization Explicit vectorization>
  is performed for SSE 2\/3\/4, ARM NEON, and AltiVec instruction sets, with graceful
  fallback to non-vectorized code.


  * Fixed-size matrices are fully optimized: dynamic memory allocation is avoided,
  and the loops are unrolled when that makes sense.


  * For large matrices, special attention is paid to cache-friendliness.


  Eigen is reliable.


  * Algorithms are carefully selected for reliability. Reliability trade-offs are
  <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/group__TopicLinearAlgebraDecompositions.html clearly
  documented> and <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/classEigen_1_1JacobiSVD.html extremely>
  <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/classEigen_1_1FullPivHouseholderQR.html safe> <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/classEigen_1_1FullPivLU.html
  decompositions> are available.


  * Eigen is thoroughly tested through its own <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Tests
  test suite> (over 500 executables), the standard BLAS test suite, and parts of the
  LAPACK test suite.


  Eigen is elegant.


  * The API is extremely <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=API_Showcase
  clean and expressive> while feeling natural to C++ programmers, thanks to expression
  templates.


  * Implementing an algorithm on top of Eigen feels like just copying pseudocode.


  Eigen has good compiler support as we run our test suite against many compilers
  to guarantee reliability and work around any compiler bugs.

  Eigen also is standard C++98 and maintains very reasonable compilation times.


  Eigen is licensed under the MPL2, which is a simple weak copyleft license. Common
  questions about the MPL2 are answered in the official MPL2 FAQ at <http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/FAQ.html>.


  Note that currently, a few features in Eigen rely on third-party code licensed under
  the LGPL: SimplicialCholesky, AMD ordering, and constrained_cg. Such features are
  explicitly disabled by compiling Eigen with the EIGEN_MPL2_ONLY preprocessor symbol
  defined.


  Virtually any software may use Eigen. For example, closed-source software may use
  Eigen without having to disclose its own source code. Many proprietary and closed-source
  software projects are using Eigen right now, as well as many BSD-licensed projects.


  Documentation at the most extent replicates original <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/
