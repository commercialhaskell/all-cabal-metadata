changelog: |
  # 1.0.3

  - Make `GNFData` PolyKinded.
  - Add `GNFData ((:~:) a)` and `GNFData TypeRep` instances

  # 1.0.2

  - Explicitly mark `Data.Some` as `Safe`.
    It was previously inferred, yet it was Safe too,
    as it only re-exports other explicitly marked modules.
  - Allow `base-4.15`, GHC-9.0 compatibility

  # 1.0.1

  - Add 'withSomeM' combinator.
    Allows to workaround: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/15681

  # 1.0.0.3

  - One less `unsafeCoerce` (thanks to David Feuer)

  # 1.0.0.2

  - Broken release

  # 1.0.0.1

  - Fix issue with GHC#9585 https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/9584

  # 1

  - Split out of `dependent-sum`
  - Have `GADT`, `Newtype`, `Church` variants
  - Add `NFData` instance

  in few variants, and utilities to work with it.

  If you are unsure which variant to use, use the one in "Data.Some" module.
