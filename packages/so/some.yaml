changelog: |
  # 1.0.4.1

  - Drop support for GHC before 8.6

  # 1.0.4

  - Add instances for `(:~~:)`
  - Add instances for `:+:` and `:*:`
  - Add `defaultGeq :: GCompare f => f a -> f b -> Maybe (a :~: b)`
  - Add `defaultGshowsPrec :: Show (t a) => Int -> t a -> ShowS`

  # 1.0.3

  - Make `GNFData` PolyKinded.
  - Add `GNFData ((:~:) a)` and `GNFData TypeRep` instances

  # 1.0.2

  - Explicitly mark `Data.Some` as `Safe`.
    It was previously inferred, yet it was Safe too,
    as it only re-exports other explicitly marked modules.
  - Allow `base-4.15`, GHC-9.0 compatibility

  # 1.0.1

  - Add 'withSomeM' combinator.
    Allows to workaround: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/15681

  # 1.0.0.3

  - One less `unsafeCoerce` (thanks to David Feuer)

  # 1.0.0.2

  - Broken release

  # 1.0.0.1

  - Fix issue with GHC#9585 https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/9584

  - Split out of `dependent-sum`
  - Have `GADT`, `Newtype`, `Church` variants
  - Add `NFData` instance

  This library defines an existential type 'Some'.

  in few variants, and utilities to work with it.

  If you are unsure which variant to use, use the one in "Data.Some" module.
