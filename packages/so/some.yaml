changelog: |
  # 1.0.3

  - Make `GNFData` PolyKinded.
  - Add `GNFData ((:~:) a)` and `GNFData TypeRep` instances

  # 1.0.2

  - Explicitly mark `Data.Some` as `Safe`.
    It was previously inferred, yet it was Safe too,
    as it only re-exports other explicitly marked modules.
  - Allow `base-4.15`, GHC-9.0 compatibility

  # 1.0.1

  - Add 'withSomeM' combinator.
    Allows to workaround: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/15681

  - One less `unsafeCoerce` (thanks to David Feuer)

  # 1.0.0.2

  # 1.0.0.1
