  Utilities for the DCPU-16 architecture, for Notch's upcoming space game, 0x10c.

  Meant to be a library for implementing powerful tools. As demonstrations, contains
  a command-line optimizing assembler\/disassembler\/pretty printer.

  Core of the library is "DCPU16.Instructions". Everything else is built around it.
