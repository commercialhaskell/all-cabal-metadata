description: |-
  The package provides a framework for heap and runtime measurements
  for single Haskell functions. For heap measurements simple programs
  are created, compiled with profiling options and run. You can do
  either a heap profile or a graph for the maximal heap consumption
  of a function over different inputsizes. For runtime measurements
  the criterion library is used.
  Measurement data can be stored in a special file format providing
  besides the data some meta information about the measurement.
  Furthermore measured data can be plotted easily using gnuplot.
  In particular, it is possible to compare measurements for different
  functions (e.g. different version of a semantically equivalent
  function) in one diagram. By using gnuplot for drawing, the
  appearance of a diagram is very flexible and can be adjusted
  directly to, for example, the style of your paper.
