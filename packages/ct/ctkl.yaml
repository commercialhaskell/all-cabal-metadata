  Light (CTKlight) is a subset of the Compiler Toolkit\n(CTK) - an infrastructure
  for writing compilers in Haskell.  CTKlight\nessentially provides support for implementing
  syntactical analysis without the\nmore heavy-weight state management (like compiler
  switches, global error pool,\nand exceptions), identifier and attribute management,
  and various other\nutilities included in the full CTK.  Both packages can be obtained
  from\n\n  http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/ctk/\n\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
  BUILDING -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nIn contrast to full CTK, CTKlight
  is simply a set of Haskell modules without\nany complicated makefile structure.
  \ The code is Haskell 98 compliant with the \nexception that `Parser.hs' makes use
  of existentially quantified type\nvariables - unfortunately, I do not believe that
  the same method of\nself-optimisation would work without existential types.\n\nThe
  modules are tested with\n\n* GHC 4.02 and upwards (use `-fglasgow-exts' to compile
  `Parsers.hs') and\n* Hugs98 (use `-98' when using `Parsers.hs').\n\nIf you want
  autoconf, a ready-made makefile structure, and much more\nadditional library functionality,
  then use full CTK.\n\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- COPYLEFT -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nThis
