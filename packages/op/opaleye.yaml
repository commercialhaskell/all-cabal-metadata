changelog: |
  ## 0.6.7004.0

  * Many changes to the documentation that use the new names.  See entry
    for version 0.6.7000.0.

  * Added `fromPGSFromField` to replace `fieldQueryRunnerColumn`.

  * Added `fromPGSFieldParser` to replace `fieldParserQueryRunnerColumn`.

  * Added `defaultFromField` to replace `queryRunnerColumnDefault`.

  * Added `tableField` to replace `tableColumn`.

  * Added `unsafeFromField` to replace `queryRunnerColumn`.

  * Added `toFieldsExplicit` to replace `constantExplicit`.

  * Added `TableRecordField` to replace `TableField` in
    `Opaleye.TypeFamilies`.  The latter may be used to replace
    `TableColumn` in the future.

  * Added array functions `arrayAppend`, `arrayRemove`, `arrayRemoveNulls`.

  ## 0.6.7003.1

  * Bumped some depedencies so there is an install plan on GHC 8.6

  ## 0.6.7003.0

  * Add `tableField` as a future replacement for `tableColumn`

  * Export `Opaleye.Field` and `Opaleye.RunSelect` from `Opaleye`

  * Use new nomenclature in tutorials

  ## 0.6.7002.0

  This is a breaking release that doesn't follow the PVP but because
  it's essentially a pre-release for version 0.7 I'm just going to
  blacklist the broken versions on Hackage and forget about it.

  * Swapped `N` and `NN` because they were the wrong way round.

  ## 0.6.7001.0

  * Fix bug with infinity in range bounds

  * Fix incompatibility with GHC 8.4

  * Add range accessors, `upperBound` and `lowerBound`

  * Add `distinctOn` and `distinctOnBy`

  ## 0.6.7000.0

  This is a pre-release of version 0.7.0.0.  GHC >= 8.0 is required.  It
  contains the following new important features

  * A new API for manipulation, including `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`
    support for `UPDATE`

  * Initial support for product types written in "Higher kinded data"
    style (but deriving of related functionality using TH or Generics is
    not yet provided).

  * Type inference for outer joins

  * Many renamings.  In particular, `Column` will become `Field` in
    0.7.0.0.  You should be able to almost completely port your code to
    the 0.7.0.0 names whilst remaining compatible with 0.6.7000.0.

  # Brief introduction to Opaleye [![Hackage version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/opaleye.svg?label=Hackage)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/opaleye) [![Linux build status](https://img.shields.io/travis/tomjaguarpaw/haskell-opaleye/master.svg?label=Linux%20build)](https://travis-ci.org/tomjaguarpaw/haskell-opaleye)

  Opaleye is a Haskell library that provides an SQL-generating embedded
  domain specific language for targeting Postgres.  You need Opaleye if
  you want to use Haskell to write typesafe and composable code to query
  a Postgres database.

  > "Opaleye really is great. You've managed to bring what is so
  wonderful about relational databases and give it type safety and
  composition (i.e. what is wonderful about Haskell)" &ndash; Daniel
  Patterson, [Position Development](http://positiondev.com/)

  > "We use it for most of our DB code. It's very flexible and almost
    always as performant as manually written queries" &ndash; [Adam
    Bergmark](http://ircbrowse.net/browse/haskell?id=22634197&timestamp=1460980502#t1460980502),
    [Silk.co](http://www.silk.co/)

  Opaleye allows you to define your database tables and write queries
  against them in Haskell code, and aims to be typesafe in the sense
  that if your code compiles then the generated SQL query will not fail
  at runtime.  A wide range of SQL functionality is supported including
  inner and outer joins, restriction, aggregation, distinct, sorting and
  limiting, unions and differences.  Facilities to insert to, update and
  delete from tables are also provided.  Code written using Opaleye is
  composable at a very fine level of granularity, promoting code reuse
  and high levels of abstraction.

  ## Getting Opaleye

  * Github: https://github.com/tomjaguarpaw/haskell-opaleye
  * Hackage: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/opaleye

  ## Tutorials

  Please get started with Opaleye by referring to these two tutorials

  * [Basic tutorial](https://github.com/tomjaguarpaw/haskell-opaleye/blob/master/Doc/Tutorial/TutorialBasic.lhs)
  * [Manipulation tutorial](https://github.com/tomjaguarpaw/haskell-opaleye/blob/master/Doc/Tutorial/TutorialManipulation.lhs)

  # Contact

  ## Contact the author

  The main author of Opaleye is Tom Ellis.  He can be [contacted via
  email](http://web.jaguarpaw.co.uk/~tom/contact/).

  ## File bugs

  Please file bugs on the [Opaleye GitHub issue tracking
  page](https://github.com/tomjaguarpaw/haskell-opaleye/issues/).

  ## Mailing list

  Please join the [opaleye-users mailing
  list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/opaleye-users).

  # `Internal` modules

  Opaleye exports a number of modules named `Opaleye.Internal....`.
  They are provided in case of urgent need for access to the internals,
  but they are not intended to be used by API consumers and if you find
  yourself repeatedly accessing them this is a sign that either you or
  Opaleye are doing something wrong.  In such a case please file a bug.

  The interface of `Internal` modules does not follow the PVP and may
  break between minor releases, so be careful.

  # Running tests

  You must have running PostgreSQL server to run tests. Specify the database
  by setting the `POSTGRES_CONNSTRING` environment variable:

  ```
  POSTGRES_CONNSTRING="user=tom dbname=opaleye_test" stack test
  ```

  # Commercial support

  Commercial support for Opaleye is provided by [Purely
  Agile](http://www.purelyagile.com/).

  # Backup maintainers

  In the event of the main developer becoming unreachable, please
  contact the following who are authorised to make bugfixes and
  dependency version bumps:

  * Adam Bergmark
  * Erik Hesselink
  * Oliver Charles

  # Contributors

  The Opaleye Project was founded by Tom Ellis, inspired by theoretical
  work on databases by David Spivak.  Much of the implementation was
  based on ideas and code from the HaskellDB project by Daan Leijen,
  Conny Andersson, Martin Andersson, Mary Bergman, Victor Blomqvist,
  Bjorn Bringert, Anders Hockersten, Torbjorn Martin, Jeremy Shaw and
  Justin Bailey.

  The following individuals and organisations made helpful contributions
  which were important in helping to get the project off the ground.

  * Silk (Erik Hesselink, Adam Bergmark)
  * Karamaan (Christopher Lewis)
  * Fynder (Renzo Carbonara, Oliver Charles)
  * Daniel Patterson
  * Jakub Ryška
  * Travis Staton

  Joseph Abrahamson, Alfredo Di Napoli and Mietek Bak performed useful
  reviews of early versions which helped improve the codebase.  Since
  then there have been helpful contributions from many others.  Thanks
  to them all for their help.
