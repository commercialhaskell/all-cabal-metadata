  ## Version 0.14.3.0 (03 Oct 2018)

  - Updated dependency bounds.

  - Fix tab completion with Commands being unreachable.

  - Clean ups and Documentation.

  ## Version 0.14.2.0 (26 Feb 2018)

  - Updated dependency bounds.

  ## Version 0.14.1.0 (23 Feb 2018)

  - Updated dependency bounds.

  - Export `HasName`, `HasCompleter`, `HasValue`, and
    `HasMetavar` type classes.

  - Doc.

  ## Version 0.14.0.0 (09 Jun 2017)

  - Upgrade `str` and related builders to be polymorphic over
    `IsString`. This allows `Text` and `Bytestring` to be used
    naturally with `strOption` and `strArgument` and friends.

    *Note:* This change may require additional type signatures
            in cases where the reader was necessary for type
            inference.

  - Export public API explicitly from `Options.Applicative`
    instead of re-exporting other modules.

    *Note:* Minor changes to exports were made in conjunction
            to this change. `ParserHelp` no longer requires an
            an extra import, and some internally used functions
            from `Options.Applicative.Common` are no longer
            exported from the main module.

  - Add Zsh and Fish completions with rich descriptions for
    options and commands.

    Use "--zsh-completion-script" and "fish-completion-script"
    to generate scripts for these shells.

  - Fix bash completions with quoted sections, tilde expansions
    and completions after "--".

  - Add suggestions to error message when a user mistypes a
    command or option.

  - Add `style` builder, for styling option descriptions.

  - Improve error message for options when a required argument
    is not supplied.

  - Fix #242 regarding flags with long options, where a flag given
    a long option could be interpreted incorrectly.

  - Fix `noIntersperse` to be more like its namesakes in other
    libraries. When on, options will be accepted until an argument
    is passed, after which all options will be treated as positional
    arguments.

  - Add `forwardOptions` builder, which will allow unknown options
    and flags to be passed to an argument builder.
    This is useful to mixed parsing environments, or wrappers to
    other commands.

  - Add `Semigroup` instances for `Completer` and `Chunk`.

  - Forwards compatibility with `MonadFail` proposal.

  - Doc

  ## Version 0.13.2.0 (9 Mar 2017)

  - Updated dependency bounds.

  - Doc

  ## Version 0.13.1.0 (10 Feb 2017)

  - Updated dependency bounds.

  - Add required test files to cabal package.

  - Doc

  ## Version 0.13.0.0 (15 Aug 2016)

  - Implement command groups, which allow subcommands to have their own
    usage description.

  - Implement showHelpOnEmpty, which is similar to showHelpOnError, but only
    fires when a command or subcommand is begun, and suppresses the "Missing:"
    error text.

  - Fix ghc 8.0 warnings

  - Fix ghc 7.10 warnings

  - Bump dependency bounds

  - Add maybeReader function for convenient ReadM creation

  - Move eitherReader to Readers section (for better discoverability)

  - Fix hsubparser metavar override

  - Remove ComplError, which was dead code.

  - Reimplement Missing error generation, which overly complicated evalParser.

  - Export Semigroup instances for types which are also Monoids. Removes
    mempty synonym `(<>)` export, as it clashes with Semigroup exports.
    One may need to import Data.Monoid or Data.Semigroup when upgrading.

  - Use a Cabal test suite for tests, simplify test dependencies.

  ## Version 0.12.1.0 (18 Jan 2016)

  - Updated dependency bounds.

  - Improve subparser contexts to improve usage error texts

  - Doc

  - Fixed bugs
      * \# 164 - Invalid options and invalid arguments after parser has succeeded
                 not displaying
      * \# 146 - multi-word filename completion is broken


  ## Version 0.12.0.0 (17 Sep 2015)

  - Add "missing" error condition descriptions when required flags and arguments
    are not provided.

  - Allow multiple short flags to be concatenated together behind a single
    hyphen, e.g. "-xcf".

  - Updated dependency bounds on `process` and `ansi-wl-pprint`.

  - Add `Show` and `Eq` instances to some types for easier debugging.

  - Add defaultPrefs, a default preferences value

  - Docs.

  ## Version 0.11.0.2 (17 Feb 2015)

  - Updated dependency bounds.

  ## Version 0.11.0.1 (5 Oct 2014)

  - Updated documentation.

  ## Version 0.11.0 (4 Oct 2014)

  - Added Alternative instances for `Chunk` and `ReadM`.

  - The `ReadM` monad is now a `ReaderT` for the argument being parsed.  User
    defined readers do not need to handle their argument explicitly, but can
    always access it using `readerAsk`.

  - Argument builders now take a `ReadM` parameter, just like options.

  - Fixed bugs
      * \#106 - argument should perhaps use `ReadM`

  ## Version 0.10.0 (1 Sep 2014)

  - Parser execution and help text generation are now more modular, and allow for
    greater customisation.

  - More consistent API for `option` and `argument` builders: now `option` takes
    a reader as argument, and `nullOption` is deprecated in favour of `option`.
    The `reader` modifier is gone.  Quick migration guide:

      * `option` (without a `reader` modifier) => `option auto`
      * `nullOption` (without a `reader` modifier) => `option disabled`
      * `option`/`nullOption` (with a `reader r` modifier) => `option r`.

  - Added convenience builder `strArgument`, equivalent to `argument str`.

  - Removed functions deprecated from at least version 0.8.0.

  - Switched test infrastructure to `tasty`.

  - Fixed bugs
      * \#63 - Inconsistency between 'argument' and 'strOption' types

  ## Version 0.9.1.1 (31 Jul 2014)

  - Fixed bugs
      * \#97 - Version 0.9.1 fails test suite

  ## Version 0.9.1 (30 Jul 2014)

  - Documentation tweaks.

  - Added low-level function to handle parse results (pull request \#94).

  - `ParserResult` now has a `Show` instance (see issue \#95).

  - Fixed bugs
      * \#93 - Formatting problem for several sub-parsers

  ## Version 0.9.0 (23 May 2014)

  - The option returned by `abortOption` is now visible by default.

  ## Version 0.8.1 (5 May 2014)

  - Fixed bugs
      * \#74 - Missing newline

  ## Version 0.8.0.1 (19 Mar 2014)

  - Fixed bugs
      * \#73 - Release 0.8.0 is broken

  ## Version 0.8.0 (16 Mar 2014)

  - Help page formatting.  Added `columns` preference modifier,
    which can be used to specify the number of columns in the output
    terminal.

  - Deprecated `arguments` and `arguments1` builders. Using `many` and `some` on a
    parser built using `argument` now returns a multiple argument parsers that
    behaves correctly with respect to `--`.

  - Fixed bugs
      * \#60 - runParser can't be called
      * \#64 - --help behaviour

  ## Version 0.7.0.2 (18 Oct 2013)

  - Fixed bugs
      * \#51 - Build fails with ghc 6.12.3 and ghc 7.0.4

  ## Version 0.7.0.1 (18 Oct 2013)

  - Minor docs fixes

  ## Version 0.7.0 (17 Oct 2013)

  - Added builders for options that always fail. This makes it
    easier to create options that just print an error message or
    display some brief information and then exit (like `--version`).

  - Added `execParserMaybe` and `customExecParserMaybe` functions
    (pull request #49).

  - Fixed bugs
      * \#47 - Current master prints help text instead of error
      * \#48 - Can we have an eitherReader convenience function?
      * \#50 - In order parsing problems.
      * \#22 - Strict (no-intersperse) arguments

  ## Version 0.6.0 (11 Oct 2013)

  - Arguments are now always parsed in order.

  - Fixed bugs
      * \#40 - Add context information to error messages
      * \#41 - Readme uses old reader API
      * \#38 - Internal types leaking into public API
      * \#44 - Can the build input restriction process == 1.1.* be relaxed?
      * \#28 - Help for subcommands

  ## Version 0.5.2.1 (24 Dic 2012)

  - Minor docs fixes.

  ## Version 0.5.2 (23 Dic 2012)

  - Fixed compatibility with GHC 7.2.

  ## Version 0.5.1 (23 Dic 2012)

  - There is a new parser preference `noBacktrack`, that controls whether how a
    failure in a subparser is propagated. By default, an unknown option in a
    subparser causes the option to be looked up in parent parsers. When
    `noBacktrack` is used, this behavior is disabled. This is useful to implement
    subcommands that have no relations with their parent commands.

  - Fixed bugs
      * \#35 - Artifacts of "hidden"
      * \#31 - Backtracking on commands
      * \#25 - Allow for using Maybe in options types to specify optional arguments
      * \#34 - No simple/obvious way to add a --version switch
      * \#29 - Document Mod
      * \#26 - Improve docs for the `Arrow` interface

  ## Version 0.5.0 (22 Dic 2012)

  - Fewer GHC extensions required.

  - Improved error handling: unrecognized options now result in an error message.

  - By default, the full help text is not displayed on parse errors anymore.
    This behavior can be controlled with the `prefShowHelpOnError` field of
    `ParserPrefs`.

  - The `(&)` operator is now deprecated. Modifiers can still be combined using
    `(<>)` or `mappend`.

  - Fixed bugs
      * \#37 - Use (\<\>) instead of (&) in documentation

  ## Version 0.4.3 (09 Dic 2012)

  - Updated dependency bounds.

  ## Version 0.4.2 (26 Nov 2012)

  - Fixed bugs
      * \#27 - Please include the test source files in the cabal sdist tarball

  ## Version 0.4.1 (04 Sep 2012)

  - Fixed bugs
      * \#19 - Regression

  ## Version 0.4.0 (05 Aug 2012)

  - Brief help text for nested commands now shows the full command line.

  - Fixed inefficiency in the `arguments` parsers for long argument lists.

  - Added automatic [bash
  completion](https://github.com/pcapriotti/optparse-applicative/wiki/Bash-Completion).

  - Added `disambiguate` modifier for `prefs`, which enabled automatic
  disambiguation of option abbreviations. With disambiguation on, a command line
  like:

          foo --out

      will match an option called `--output`, as long as its the only one starting
      with the string `out`.

  - Added `briefDesc` modifier.

  - Fixed bugs
      * \#8 - Long options not disambiguated
      * \#10 - Shell completions
      * \#16 - Possible memory leak?

  ## Version 0.3.2 (31 Jul 2012)

  - Fixed bug where both branches of an alternative could be matched.

  - Improved brief help text for alternatives.

  ## Version 0.3.1 (30 Jul 2012)

  - Added new `showDefault` and `showDefaultWith` modifiers, which will result in
  the default value (if present) to be displayed in the help text.

  - Fixed bugs
      * \#12 - Optionally display default values in help

  ## Version 0.3.0 (30 Jul 2012)

  - Option modifiers are now instances of `Monoid` instead of `Category`.

  - Dropped dependencies on data-default and data-lens.

  - Fixed bugs
      * \#14 - "arguments" can no longer take a list as a default

  ## Version 0.2.0 (23 Jul 2012)

  - Parser is now an instance of Alternative. This makes it possible to build
  certain complex parsers that were not definable before. See
  `tests/Examples/Alternatives.hs` for a simple example.

  - Removed `multi` modifier. You can now use the `many` or `some` methods from
  `Alternative`, instead, to create parsers for options that can appear more than
  once.

  - Added new `flag'` builder that returns a flag without a default value.
  Although flags without default values were not useful before, with the addition
  of `Alternative` combinators, they do have valid use cases.

  - Added new `internal` modifier for options. An internal option is completely
  invisible in the help text.

  - Added a new `customExecParser` function, which takes an additional
  `ParserPrefs` parameter. At the moment, `ParserPrefs` can only be used to
  control how many-valued option metavars are displayed in the help text. Setting
  its `multiSuffix` field to e.g. `...` will result in an `arguments` parser
  description like `[METAVAR]...`.

  - Fixed bugs
      * \#6 - "arguments" swallows options
      * \#5 - Help formatting for "arguments" misleading

  ## Version 0.1.1 (21 Jul 2012)

  - New arrow interface

  - Fixed bugs
        * \#7 - "arguments" reads positional arguments in reverse

  ## Version 0.1.0 (07 Jul 2012)

  - Improved error reporting internals

  - Removed template-haskell dependency

  - Fixed bugs:
        * \#3 - No help for subparsers
        * \#4 - Extra empty lines around command list

  ## Version 0.0.1 (09 Jun 2012)

  - Initial release.

  optparse-applicative is a haskell library for parsing options on
  the command line, providing a powerful [applicative] interface
  for composing these options.

  optparse-applicative takes care of reading and validating the
  arguments passed to the command line, handling and reporting errors,
  generating a usage line, a comprehensive help screen, and enabling
  context-sensitive bash, zsh, and fish completions.

  ## Introduction

  The core type in optparse-applicative is a `Parser`

  ```haskell
  data Parser a

  instance Functor Parser
  instance Applicative Parser
  instance Alternative Parser
  ```

  A value of type `Parser a` represents a specification for a set of
  options, which will yield a value of type `a` when the command line
  arguments are successfully parsed.

  If you are familiar with parser combinator libraries like [parsec],
  [attoparsec], or the json parser [aeson] you will feel right at
  home with optparse-applicative.

  If not, don't worry! All you really need to learn are a few basic
  parsers, and how to compose them as instances of `Applicative` and
  `Alternative`.

  ## Quick Start

  Here's a simple example of a parser.

  ```haskell
  import Options.Applicative
  import Data.Semigroup ((<>))

  data Sample = Sample
    { hello      :: String
    , quiet      :: Bool
    , enthusiasm :: Int }

  sample :: Parser Sample
  sample = Sample
        <$> strOption
            ( long "hello"
           <> metavar "TARGET"
           <> help "Target for the greeting" )
        <*> switch
            ( long "quiet"
           <> short 'q'
           <> help "Whether to be quiet" )
        <*> option auto
            ( long "enthusiasm"
           <> help "How enthusiastically to greet"
           <> showDefault
           <> value 1
           <> metavar "INT" )
  ```

  The parser is built using an [applicative] style starting from a
  set of basic combinators. In this example, hello is defined as an
  option with a `String` argument, while quiet is a boolean flag
  (called a switch) and enthusiasm gets parsed as an `Int` with help
  of the `Read` type class.


  The parser can be used like this:

  ```haskell
  main :: IO ()
  main = greet =<< execParser opts
    where
      opts = info (sample <**> helper)
        ( fullDesc
       <> progDesc "Print a greeting for TARGET"
       <> header "hello - a test for optparse-applicative" )

  greet :: Sample -> IO ()
  greet (Sample h False n) = putStrLn $ "Hello, " ++ h ++ replicate n '!'
  greet _ = return ()
  ```

  The `greet` function is the entry point of the program, while `opts`
  is a complete description of the program, used when generating a
  help text. The `helper` combinator takes any parser, and adds a
  `help` option to it.

  The `hello` option in this example is mandatory since it doesn't
  have a default value, so running the program without any argument
  will display an appropriate error message and a short option summary:

      Missing: --hello TARGET

      Usage: hello --hello TARGET [-q|--quiet] [--enthusiasm INT]
        Print a greeting for TARGET

  Running the program with the `--help` option will display the full help text
  containing a detailed list of options with descriptions

  ```
      hello - a test for optparse-applicative

      Usage: hello --hello TARGET [-q|--quiet] [--enthusiasm INT]
        Print a greeting for TARGET

      Available options:
        --hello TARGET           Target for the greeting
        -q,--quiet               Whether to be quiet
        --enthusiasm INT         How enthusiastically to greet (default: 1)
        -h,--help                Show this help text
  ```

  ## Basics
  ### Parsers

  optparse-applicative provides a number of primitive parsers,
  corresponding to different posix style options, through its *Builder*
  interface. These are detailed in their [own section](#builders)
  below, for now, here's a look at a few more examples to get a feel
  for how parsers can be defined.


  Here is a parser for a mandatory option with an argument:

  ```haskell
  target :: Parser String
  target = strOption
    (  long "hello"
    <> metavar "TARGET"
    <> help "Target for the greeting" )
  ```

  One can see that we are defining an option parser for a `String`
  argument, with *long* option name "hello", *metavariable* "TARGET",
  and the given help text. This means that the `target` parser defined
  above will require an option like

      --hello world

  on the command line. The metavariable and the help text will appear
  in the generated help text, but don't otherwise affect the behaviour
  of the parser.

  The attributes passed to the option are called *modifiers*, and are
  composed using the [semigroup] operation `(<>)`.

  Options with an argument such as `target` are referred to as *regular
  options*, and are very common.  Another type of option is a *flag*,
  the simplest of which is a boolean *switch*, for example:

  ```haskell
  quiet :: Parser Bool
  quiet = switch ( long "quiet" <> short 'q' <> help "Whether to be quiet" )
  ```

  Here we used a `short` modifier to specify a one-letter name for
  the option.  This means that this switch can be set either with
  `--quiet` or `-q`.

  Flags, unlike regular options, have no arguments. They simply return
  a predetermined value. For the simple switch above, this is `True`
  if the user types the flag, and `False` otherwise.

  There are other kinds of basic parsers, and several ways to configure
  them.  These are covered in the [Builders](#builders) section.

  ### Applicative

  Now we may combine the `target` and `quiet` into a single parser that
  accepts both options and returns a combined value. Given a type

  ```haskell
  data Options = Options
    { optTarget :: String
    , optQuiet :: Bool }
  ```

  and now it's just a matter of using `Applicative`'s apply operator `(<*>)`
  to combine the two previously defined parsers

  ```haskell
  opts :: Parser Options
  opts = Options <$> target <*> quiet
  ```

  No matter which parsers appear first in the sequence, options will
  still be parsed in whatever order they appear in the command line.
  A parser with such a property is sometimes called a *permutation
  parser*.

  In our example, a command line like:

      --target world -q

  will give the same result as

      -q --target world

  It is this property which leads us to an Applicative interface
  instead of a Monadic one, as all options must be considered in
  parallel, and can not depend on the output of other options.

  Note, however, that the order of sequencing is still somewhat
  significant, in that it affects the generated help text. Customisation
  can be achieved easily through a lambda abstraction, with [Arrow
  notation](#arrow-interface), or by taking advantage of GHC 8's
  [ApplicativeDo](#applicative-do) extension.

  ### Alternative

  It is also common to find programs that can be configured in different
  ways through the command line.  A typical example is a program that
  can be given a text file as input, or alternatively read it directly
  from the standard input.

  We can model this easily and effectively in Haskell using *sum types*:

  ```haskell
  data Input
    = FileInput FilePath
    | StdInput

  run :: Input -> IO ()
  run = ...
  ```

  We can now define two basic parsers for the components of the sum type:

  ```haskell
  fileInput :: Parser Input
  fileInput = FileInput <$> strOption
    (  long "file"
    <> short 'f'
    <> metavar "FILENAME"
    <> help "Input file" )

  stdInput :: Parser Input
  stdInput = flag' StdInput
    (  long "stdin"
    <> help "Read from stdin" )
  ```

  As the `Parser` type constructor is an instance of `Alternative`, we can
  compose these parsers with a choice operator `(<|>)`

  ```haskell
  input :: Parser Input
  input = fileInput <|> stdInput
  ```

  Now `--file "foo.txt"` will be parsed as `FileInput "foo.txt"`, `--stdin`
  will be parsed as `StdInput`, but a command line containing both options,
  like

      --file "foo.txt" --stdin

  will be rejected.

  Having `Applicative` and `Alternative` instances, optparse-applicative
  parsers are also able to be composed with standard combinators. For
  example: `optional :: Alternative f => f a -> f (Maybe a)` will
  mean the user is not required to provide input for the affected
  `Parser`.

  ### Running parsers

  Before we can run a `Parser`, we need to wrap it into a `ParserInfo`
  structure, that specifies a number of properties that only apply
  to top level parsers, such as a header describing what the program
  does, to be displayed in the help screen.

  The function `info` will help with this step.  In the [Quick Start](#quick-start)
  we saw

  ```haskell
  opts :: ParserInfo Sample
  opts = info (sample <**> helper)
    ( fullDesc
    <> progDesc "Print a greeting for TARGET"
    <> header "hello - a test for optparse-applicative" )
  ```

  The `helper` parser that we added after `opts` just creates a dummy
  `--help` option that displays the help text.  Besides that, we just
  set some of the fields of the `ParserInfo` structure with meaningful
  values.  Now that we have a `ParserInfo`, we can finally run the
  parser.  The simplest way to do so is to simply call the `execParser`
  function in your `main`:

  ```haskell
  main :: IO ()
  main = do
    options <- execParser opts
    ...
  ```

  The `execParser` function takes care of everything, including getting
  the arguments from the command line, displaying errors and help
  screens to the user, and exiting with an appropriate exit code.

  There are other ways to run a `ParserInfo`, in situations where you
  need finer control over the behaviour of your parser, or if you
  want to use it in pure code. They will be covered in [Custom parsing
  and error handling](#custom-parsing-and-error-handling).

  ## Builders

  Builders allow you to define parsers using a convenient combinator-based
  syntax. We have already seen examples of builders in action, like
  `strOption` and `switch`, which we used to define the `opts` parser
  for our "hello" example.

  Builders always take a [modifier](#modifiers) argument, which is
  essentially a composition of functions acting on the option, setting
  values for properties or adding features.

  Builders work by building the option from scratch, and eventually
  lifting it to a single-option parser, ready to be combined with
  other parsers using normal `Applicative` and `Alternative` combinators.

  See the [haddock documentation][hackage] for `Options.Applicative.Builder`
  for a full list of builders and modifiers.

  There are four different kinds of options in `optparse-applicative`:
  regular options, flags, arguments, and commands. In the following,
  we will go over each one of these and describe the builders that
  can be used to create them.

  ### Regular options

  A *regular option* is an option which takes a single argument,
  parses it, and returns a value.

  A regular option can have a default value, which is used as the
  result if the option is not found in the command line. An option
  without a default value is considered mandatory, and produces an
  error when not found.

  Regular options can have *long* names, or *short* (one-character)
  names, which determine when the option matches and how the argument
  is extracted.

  An option with a long name (say "output") is specified on the command
  line as


      --output filename.txt

  or

      --output=filename.txt

  while a short name option (say "o") can be specified with

      -o filename.txt

  or

      -ofilename.txt

  Options can have more than one name, usually one long and one short,
  although you are free to create options with an arbitrary combination
  of long and short names.

  Regular options returning strings are the most common, and they can
  be created using the `strOption` builder. For example,

  ```haskell
  strOption
     ( long "output"
    <> short 'o'
    <> metavar "FILE"
    <> value "out.txt"
    <> help "Write output to FILE" )
  ```

  creates a regular option with a string argument (which can be
  referred to as `FILE` in the help text and documentation), default
  value "out.txt", a long name "output" and a short name "o".

  A regular `option` can return an object of any type, and takes a
  *reader* parameter which specifies how the argument should be parsed.
  A common reader is `auto`, which requires a `Read` instance for the
  return type and uses it to parse its argument. For example:

  ```haskell
  lineCount :: Parser Int
  lineCount = option auto
              ( long "lines"
             <> short 'n'
             <> metavar "K"
             <> help "Output the last K lines" )
  ```

  specifies a regular option with an `Int` argument. We added an
  explicit type annotation here, since without it the parser would
  have been polymorphic in the output type. There's usually no need
  to add type annotations, however, because the type will be normally
  inferred from the context in which the parser is used.

  Further information on *readers* is available [below](#option-readers).

  ### Flags

  A *flag* is just like a regular option, but it doesn't take any
  arguments, it is either present in the command line or not.

  A flag has a default value and an *active value*. If the flag is
  found on the command line, the active value is returned, otherwise
  the default value is used. For example:

  ```haskell
  data Verbosity = Normal | Verbose

  flag Normal Verbose
    ( long "verbose"
   <> short 'v'
   <> help "Enable verbose mode" )
  ```

  is a flag parser returning a `Verbosity` value.

  Simple boolean flags can be specified using the `switch` builder, like so:

  ```haskell
  switch
    ( long "keep-tmp-files"
   <> help "Retain all intermediate temporary files" )
  ```

  There is also a `flag'` builder, which has no default value. This
  was demonstrated earlier for our `--stdin` flag example, and is
  usually used as one side of an alternative.

  Another interesting use for the `flag'` builder is to count the
  number of instances on the command line, for example, verbosity
  settings could be specified on a scale; the following parser will
  count the number of instances of `-v` on the command line.

  ```haskell
  length <$> many (flag' () (short 'v'))
  ```

  Flags can be used together after a single hyphen, so  `-vvv` and
  `-v -v -v` will both yield 3 for the above parser.

  ### Arguments

  An *argument* parser specifies a positional command line argument.

  The `argument` builder takes a reader parameter, and creates a
  parser which will return the parsed value every time it is passed
  a command line argument for which the reader succeeds. For example

  ```haskell
  argument str (metavar "FILE")
  ```

  creates an argument accepting any string.  To accept an arbitrary
  number of arguments, combine the `argument` builder with either the
  `many` or `some` combinator:

  ```haskell
  some (argument str (metavar "FILES..."))
  ```

  Note that arguments starting with `-` are considered options by
  default, and will not be considered by an `argument` parser.

  However, parsers always accept a special argument: `--`. When a
  `--` is found on the command line, all the following words are
  considered by `argument` parsers, regardless of whether they start
  with `-` or not.

  Arguments use the same *readers* as regular options.

  ### Commands

  A *command* can be used to specify a sub-parser to be used when a
  certain string is encountered in the command line.

  Commands are useful to implement command line programs with multiple
  functions, each with its own set of options, and possibly some
  global options that apply to all of them. Typical examples are
  version control systems like `git`, or build tools like `cabal`.

  A command can be created using the `subparser` builder (or `hsubparser`,
  which is identical but for an additional `--help` option on each
  command), and commands can be added with the `command` modifier.
  For example

  ```haskell
  subparser
    ( command "add" (info addOptions ( progDesc "Add a file to the repository" ))
   <> command "commit" (info commitOptions ( progDesc "Record changes to the repository" ))
    )
  ```

  Each command takes a full `ParserInfo` structure, which will be
  used to extract a description for this command when generating a
  help text.

  Note that all the parsers appearing in a command need to have the
  same type.  For this reason, it is often best to use a sum type
  which has the same structure as the command itself. For example,
  for the parser above, you would define a type like:

  ```haskell
  data Options = Options
    { optCommand :: Command
    , ... }

  data Command
    = Add AddOptions
    | Commit CommitOptions
    ...
  ```

  Alternatively, you can directly return an `IO` action from a parser,
  and execute it using `join` from `Control.Monad`.

  ```haskell
  start :: String -> IO ()
  stop :: IO ()

  opts :: Parser (IO ())
  opts = subparser
    ( command "start" (info (start <$> argument str idm) idm)
   <> command "stop"  (info (pure stop) idm) )

  main :: IO ()
  main = join $ execParser (info opts idm)
  ```

  ### Modifiers

  *Modifiers* are instances of the `Semigroup` and `Monoid` typeclasses,
  so they can be combined using the composition function `mappend`
  (or simply `(<>)`).  Since different builders accept different sets
  of modifiers, modifiers have a type parameter that specifies which
  builders support it.

  For example,

  ```haskell
  command :: String -> ParserInfo a -> Mod CommandFields a
  ```

  can only be used with [commands](#commands), as the `CommandFields`
  type argument of `Mod` will prevent it from being passed to builders
  for other types of options.

  Many modifiers are polymorphic in this type argument, which means
  that they can be used with any builder.

  ## Custom parsing and error handling

  ### Parser runners
  Parsers are run with the `execParser` family of functions — from
  easiest to use to most flexible these are:

  ```haskell
  execParser       :: ParserInfo a -> IO a
  customExecParser :: ParserPrefs -> ParserInfo a -> IO a
  execParserPure   :: ParserPrefs -> ParserInfo a -> [String] -> ParserResult a
  ```

  When using the `IO` functions, retrieving command line arguments
  and handling exit codes and failure will be done automatically.
  When using `execParserPure`, the functions

  ```haskell
  handleParseResult :: ParserResult a -> IO a
  overFailure :: (ParserHelp -> ParserHelp) -> ParserResult a -> ParserResult a
  ```

  can be used to correctly set exit codes and display the help message;
  and modify the help message in the event of a failure (adding
  additional information for example).

  ### Option readers

  Options and Arguments require a way to interpret the string passed
  on the command line to the type desired. The `str` and `auto`
  *readers* are the most common way, but one can also create a custom
  reader that doesn't use the `Read` type class or return a `String`,
  and use it to parse the option. A custom reader is a value in the
  `ReadM` monad.

  We provide the `eitherReader :: (String -> Either String a) -> ReadM a`
  convenience function to help create these values, where a `Left` will
  hold the error message for a parse failure.

  ```haskell
  data FluxCapacitor = ...

  parseFluxCapacitor :: ReadM FluxCapacitor
  parseFluxCapacitor = eitherReader $ \s -> ...

  option parseFluxCapacitor ( long "flux-capacitor" )
  ```

  One can also use `ReadM` directly, using `readerAsk` to obtain the
  command line string, and `readerAbort` or `readerError` within the
  `ReadM` monad to exit with an error message.

  One nice property of `eitherReader` is how well it composes with
  [attoparsec] parsers with

  ```haskell
  import qualified Data.Attoparsec.Text as A
  attoReadM :: A.Parser a -> ReadM a
  attoReadM p = eitherReader (A.parseOnly p . T.pack)
  ```

  ### Preferences
  `PrefsMod`s can be used to customise the look of the usage text and
  control when it is displayed; turn off backtracking of subparsers;
  and turn on [disambiguation](#disambiguation).

  To use these modifications, provide them to the `prefs` builder,
  and pass the resulting preferences to one of the parser runners
  that take an `ParserPrefs` parameter, like `customExecParser`.


  ### Disambiguation

  It is possible to configure optparse-applicative to perform automatic
  disambiguation of prefixes of long options. For example, given a
  program `foo` with options `--filename` and `--filler`, typing

      $ foo --fil test.txt

  fails, whereas typing

      $ foo --file test.txt

  succeeds, and correctly identifies `"file"` as an unambiguous prefix
  of the `filename` option.

  Option disambiguation is *off* by default. To enable it, use the
  `disambiguate` `PrefsMod` modifier as described above.

  Here is a minimal example:

  ```haskell
  import Options.Applicative

  sample :: Parser ()
  sample = () <$
    switch (long "filename") <*
    switch (long "filler")

  main :: IO ()
  main = customExecParser p opts
    where
      opts = info (helper <*> sample) idm
      p = prefs disambiguate

  ```

  ### Customising the help screen

  optparse-applicative has a number of combinators to help customise
  the usage text, and determine when it should be displayed.

  The `progDesc`, `header`, and `footer` functions can be used to
  specify a brief description or tagline for the program, and detailed
  information surrounding the generated option and command descriptions.

  Internally we actually use the [ansi-wl-pprint][ansi-wl-pprint]
  library, and one can use the `headerDoc` combinator and friends if
  additional customisation is required.

  To display the usage text, the user may type `--help` if the `helper`
  combinator has been applied to the `Parser`.

  Authors can also use the preferences `showHelpOnError` or
  `showHelpOnEmpty` to show the help text on any parser failure or
  when a command is not complete and at the beginning of the parse
  of the main program or one of its subcommands respectively.

  Even if the help text is not shown for an error, a specific error
  message will be, indicating what's missing, or what was unable to
  be parsed.

  ```haskell
  myParser :: Parser ()
  myParser = ...

  main :: IO ()
  main = customExecParser p opts
    where
      opts = info (myParser <**> helper) idm
      p = prefs showHelpOnEmpty
  ```

  ### Command groups

  One experimental feature which may be useful for programs with many
  subcommands is command group separation.

  ```haskell
  data Sample
    = Hello [String]
    | Goodbye
    deriving (Eq, Show)

  hello :: Parser Sample
  hello = Hello <$> many (argument str (metavar "TARGET..."))

  sample :: Parser Sample
  sample = subparser
         ( command "hello" (info hello (progDesc "Print greeting"))
        <> command "goodbye" (info (pure Goodbye) (progDesc "Say goodbye"))
         )
        <|> subparser
         ( command "bonjour" (info hello (progDesc "Print greeting"))
        <> command "au-revoir" (info (pure Goodbye) (progDesc "Say goodbye"))
        <> commandGroup "French commands:"
        <> hidden
         )
  ```

  This will logically separate the usage text for the two subparsers
  (these would normally appear together if the `commandGroup` modifier
  was not used). The `hidden` modifier suppresses the metavariable
  for the second subparser being show in the brief usage line, which
  is desirable in some cases.

  In this example we have essentially created synonyms for our parser,
  but one could use this to separate common commands from rare ones,
  or safe from dangerous.

  The usage text for the preceding example is:
  ```
  Usage: commands COMMAND

  Available options:
    -h,--help                Show this help text

  Available commands:
    hello                    Print greeting
    goodbye                  Say goodbye

  French commands:
    bonjour                  Print greeting
    au-revoir                Say goodbye
  ```

  ## Bash, Zsh, and Fish Completions

  `optparse-applicative` has built-in support for the completion of
  command line options and arguments in bash, zsh, and fish shells.
  Any parser, when run using the `execParser` family of functions,
  is automatically extended with a few (hidden) options for the
  completion system:

   - `--bash-completion-script`: this takes the full path of the program as
     argument, and prints a bash script, which, when sourced into a bash session,
     will install the necessary machinery to make bash completion work. For a
     quick test, you can run something like (for a program called `foo` on the
     `PATH`):

     ```console
     $ source <(foo --bash-completion-script `which foo`)
     ```

     Normally, the output of `--bash-completion-script` should be shipped with
     the program and copied to the appropriate directory (usually
     `/etc/bash_completion.d/`) during installation;

   - `--zsh-completion-script`: which is analogous for zsh;

   - `--fish-completion-script`: which is analogous for fish shell;

   - `--bash-completion-index`, `--bash-completion-word`: internal options used
     by the completion script to obtain a list of possible completions for a
     given command line;

   - `--bash-completion-enriched`: a flag to tell the completion system to emit
     descriptions along with possible completions. This is used to provide help
     along with the completion for `zsh` and `fish`.

  ### Actions and completers

  By default, options and commands are always completed. So, for example, if the
  program `foo` has an option with a long name `output`, typing

  ```console
  $ foo --ou<TAB>
  ```

  will complete `--output` automatically.

  Arguments (either of regular options, or top-level) are not completed by
  default. To enable completion for arguments, use one of the following modifiers
  on a regular option or argument:

   - `completeWith`: specifies a list of possible completions to choose from;
   - `action`: specifies a completion "action". An action dynamically determines
     a list of possible completions. Common actions are "file" and "directory";
     the full list of actions can be found in the [bash documentation];
   - `completer`: a completer is a function `String -> IO [String]`, returning
     all possible completions for a given string. You can use this modifier to
     specify a custom completion for an argument.

  Completion modifiers can be used multiple times: the resulting completions will
  call all of them and join the results.

  ### Internals

  When running a parser with `execParser`, the parser is extended with
  `bashCompletionParser`, which defines the above options.

  When completion is triggered, the completion script calls the executable with
  the special `--bash-completion-index` and `--bash-completion-word` options.

  The original parser is therefore run in *completion mode*, i.e. `runParser` is
  called on a different monad, which keeps track of the current state of the
  parser, and exits when all arguments have been processed.

  The completion monad returns, on failure, either the last state of the parser
  (if no option could be matched), or the completer associated to an option (if
  it failed while fetching the argument for that option).

  From that we generate a list of possible completions, and print them to
  standard output. They are then read by the completion script and put into the
  `COMPREPLY` variable (or an appropriate alternative for the other shells).

  ## Arrow interface

  It is also possible to use the [Arrow syntax][arrows] to combine basic parsers.

  This can be particularly useful when the structure holding parse results is
  deeply nested, or when the order of fields differs from the order in which the
  parsers should be applied.

  Using functions from the `Options.Applicative.Arrows` module, one can write,
  for example:

  ```haskell
  data Options = Options
    { optArgs :: [String]
    , optVerbose :: Bool }

  opts :: Parser Options
  opts = runA $ proc () -> do
    verbosity  <- asA (option auto (short 'v' <> value 0)) -< ()
    let verbose = verbosity > 0
    args       <- asA (many (argument str idm)) -< ()
    returnA -< Options args verbose
  ```

  where parsers are converted to arrows using `asA`, and the resulting
  composed arrow is converted back to a `Parser` with `runA`.

  See `tests/Examples/Cabal.hs` for a slightly more elaborate example
  using the arrow syntax for defining parsers.

  Note that the `Arrow` interface is provided only for convenience. The
  API based on `Applicative` is just as expressive, although it might be
  cumbersome to use in certain cases.

  ## Applicative do

  Some may find using optparse-applicative easier using do notation.
  However, as `Parser` is not an instance of `Monad`, this can only
  be done in recent versions of GHC using the *ApplicativeDo* extension.
  For example, a parser specified in this manner might be

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE RecordWildCards            #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE ApplicativeDo              #-}

  data Options = Options
    { optArgs :: [String]
    , optVerbose :: Bool }

  opts :: Parser Options
  opts = do
    optVerbose    <- switch (short 'v')
    optArgs       <- many (argument str idm)
    pure Options {..}
  ```

  Here we've also used the *RecordWildCards* extension to make the
  parser specification cleaner. Compilation errors referring to `Monad`
  instances not being found are likely because the `Parser` specified
  can not be implemented entirely with `Applicative` (Note however,
  there were a few desugaring bugs regarding ApplicativeDo in GHC
  8.0.1, function application with `($)` in particular may not work,
  and the `pure` value should instead be wrapped parenthetically).

  ## FAQ

  * Monadic parsing?

    If a Monadic style were to be used, there would be no possible
    way to traverse the parser and generate a usage string, or for
    us to allow for options to be parsed in any order. Therefore it
    is intentionally unsupported to write a `Parser` in this manner
    with optparse-applicative, and the `Parser` type does not have
    an instance for `Monad`.

  * Overlapping flags and options / options with optional arguments?

    This is not supported as it can lead to an ambiguous parse.

    For example, if we supported and had an optional value option
    "--foo" and a flag "--bar", is "--foo --bar" the option with value
    "--bar", or the default value with the flag switched on? What if
    instead of a switch we had many positional string arguments, is
    the first string the option's value or the first positional?

    It is suggested to instead use the `Alternative` instance of
    `Parser` and create a flag', an option, and a pure value for the
    default (with different names for the flag and option).

  * Backtracking on `ReadM` errors?

    Parser structures are predetermined at parse time. This means
    that if a `ReadM` fails, the whole parse must also fail, we can't
    consider any alternatives, as there can be no guarantee that the
    remaining structure will fit.  One occasionally confusing side
    effect of this is that two positional arguments for different
    constructors of a sum type can't be composed at the parser level;
    rather, this must be done at the `ReadM` level. For example:

    ```haskell
    import Options.Applicative

    data S3orFile = S3 BucketKey | File FilePath

    s3Read, fileRead :: ReadM S3orFile
    s3Read = S3 <$> ...
    fileRead = File <$> ...

    correct :: Parser S3orFile
    correct = argument (s3Read <|> fileRead) idm

    incorrect :: Parser S3orFile
    incorrect = argument s3Read idm <|> argument fileRead idm
    ```

  ## How it works
  An applicative `Parser` is essentially a heterogeneous list or tree
  of `Option`s, implemented with existential types.

  All options are therefore known statically (i.e. before parsing,
  not necessarily before runtime), and can, for example, be traversed
  to generate a help text. Indeed, when displaying the usage text for
  a parser, we use an intermediate tree structure.

  When we examine the user's input, each argument is examined to
  determine if it's an option or flag, or a positional argument. The
  parse tree is then searched for a matching term, and if it finds
  one, that leaf of the tree is replaced with the value itself. When
  all input has been processed, we see if we can generate the complete
  value, and if not issue an error.

  See [this blog post][blog] for a more detailed explanation based on a
  simplified implementation.
