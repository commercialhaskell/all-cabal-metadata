  * opentracing/0.2.1 (2021-11-08)

    Support aeson 2.x (#39)

  * 0.2.0 (2021-06-03)

    - Drop support for GHC 8.0 (#35)
    - Add support for GHC 9.0 (#36)
    - Replace the unmaintained `thrift` package with `pinch` (#34)
    - wai: Better default operation name, and allow customising it (#33, #37)

    The major version is bumped because the packages won't compile with GHC 8.0
    anymore.

  * 0.1.0.0 (2021-04-20)

    After years of friendly reminders, a zero version gets finally released =]

  ## OpenTracing

  The [OpenTracing spec](https://github.com/opentracing/specification/blob/master/specification.md) defines a platform agnostic approach for distributed tracing. Distributed
  tracing gives us insights into how complex programs spread across multiple processes are
  performing together.

  This package provides a core implementation of the OpenTracing spec. It includes
  functionality to

    * Create `Span`s describing application code executions, including `Tag`s and
      `LogRecord`s

    * Serialize and deserialize `SpanContext`s across process boundaries

    * Batch and log `FinishedSpan`s

  It does not provide any functionality for consuming `Span`s. There are platform specific
  backends (CloudTrace, Zipkin, Jaeger, etc) that are provided in other packages.
