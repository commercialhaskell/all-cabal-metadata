  # `opentelemetry-plugin` - a GHC plugin for open telemetry

  This GHC plugin lets you export granular open telemetry metrics for your Haskell
  builds.  Specifically, this creates a trace with:

  - One span for each module build
  - One sub-span for each phase of each module build

  ![Example trace generated by this GHC plugin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1313787/272098736-1d1e4e7b-4122-45be-8f7b-e74f2ccddab0.png)

  Note that due to limitations of GHC's `Plugin` interface the root span generated
  by this plugin will have a duration of 0 (by default) and will not be the
  correct duration (for the entire build).  However, the `Plugin` will reuse any
  surrounding span inherited via
  [the standard `TRACEPARENT` and `TRACESTATE` environment variables](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/),
  so if you wrap your build in something like the `hotel` executable (from
  [the `hotel-california` package](https://github.com/parsonsmatt/hotel-california))
  then you will get the correct duration for the outermost span.

  This plugin also supports
  [the standard `BAGGAGE` environment variable](https://www.w3.org/TR/baggage/),
  too.

  To use this plugin:

  - add the `opentelemetry-plugin` package as a build dependency of your package

  - add `ghc-options: -fplugin OpenTelemetry.Plugin` to your package

  - configure the appropriate open telemetry environment variables

    In other words, you'll probably want to set at least
    `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and maybe other environment variables depending
    on your open telemetry backend.  For example, if you're using
    [Honeycomb](https://docs.honeycomb.io/getting-data-in/opentelemetry-overview/#using-the-honeycomb-opentelemetry-endpoint)
    then you'd also want to set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` and
    `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`.

  Then any time you build your project the build will export open telemetry
  metrics.  The overhead of metrics export is negligible.

  ## Development

  This repository uses Nix for development.  You can build this package entirely
  using Nix for a specific version of `ghc` by running:

  ```ShellSession
  $ nix develop .#ghc${MAJOR}${MINOR}
  ```

  â€¦ replacing `${MAJOR}` and `${MINOR}` with the major and minor version of the
  `ghc` that you're using.  For example, if you're using GHC 9.4, then you'd run:

  ```ShellSession
  $ nix build .#ghc94
  ```

  If you want to develop interactively using Cabal inside of a Nix shell, run:

  ```ShellSession
  $ nix develop .#ghc${MAJOR}${MINOR}
  ```

  Once you are inside that Nix shell, then you can use `cabal` commands, like
  `cabal build` or `cabal repl`.  You can also use `ghcid` or launch your favorite
  IDE from inside this shell.
