description: ! 'A version of Operational \[1\] suitable for EDSLs

  extensible via data types à la carte.


  This library provides two important extensions to

  Operational:


  1. The ability for instructions to refer to sub-programs in

  a generic way. (This is a key to obtaining an extensible

  library.)


  2. Generic interpretation of programs, including

  sub-programs and other sub-structures (e.g.

  expressions).


  More information is found in the documentation of

  "Control.Monad.Operational.Higher".
