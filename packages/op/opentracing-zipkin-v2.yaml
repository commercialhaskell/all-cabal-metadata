changelog: |
  * 0.3.0 (2023-09-28)

    - GHC 8.x is no longer tested, the minimum version is 9.2.8
    - Various fixes the Jaeger backend
    - Fix Zipkin backend to use POST (#49)
    - Use a bounded queue for the batch reporter (#46)

    This release is considered _breaking_ due to #46, and (potential)
    incompatibility with older GHCs.

  * 0.2.2 (2022-05-09)

    Support for base 4.16 / GHC 9.2

    GHC versions below 8.10 are no longer tested in CI.

  * opentracing/0.2.1 (2021-11-08)

    Support aeson 2.x (#39)

  * 0.2.0 (2021-06-03)

    - Drop support for GHC 8.0 (#35)
    - Add support for GHC 9.0 (#36)
    - Replace the unmaintained `thrift` package with `pinch` (#34)
    - wai: Better default operation name, and allow customising it (#33, #37)

    The major version is bumped because the packages won't compile with GHC 8.0
    anymore.

  * 0.1.0.0 (2021-04-20)

    After years of friendly reminders, a zero version gets finally released =]
