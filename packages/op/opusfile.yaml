  # opusfile

  https://opus-codec.org/

  > Opus is a totally open, royalty-free, highly versatile audio codec.
  > Opus is unmatched for interactive speech and music transmission over the Internet,
  > but is also intended for storage and streaming applications.

  My intention were to use the Opus codec for game assets with OpenAL.
  There's `examples/openal-playfile` exactly for this.

  You'll need `libopusfile-dev` or something like that for your distro.

  Add to package dependencies and import `Sound.OpusFile` qualified.
