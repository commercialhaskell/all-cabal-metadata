  # oplang

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/oplang?style=for-the-badge)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/oplang)

  OpLang is a stack-based esoteric programming language based on [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).

  ## Installing

  The compiler is available on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/oplang), and can be installed via [cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) (which can itself be installed via [ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/)).

  ```sh
  cabal install oplang
  ```

  ## Usage

  To compile and run an OpLang program, use:

  ```sh
  oplang code.op
  ./code.out
  ```

  For a list of available command-line options, use `oplang --help`.

  ## Building from source

  Prerequisites:

  * `GHC` >=9.2
  * `cabal` >=3.6

  (Both can be installed via [ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/))

  To build the project, use `cabal build`.

  To run the project locally (without installing), use `cabal run . -- <args>`.

  ## Language Features

  OpLang is a strict superset of Brainfuck.

  Its main improvement is the addition of user-defined operators, which are analogous to user-defined functions in languages like C or Python.

  The "memory tape" in OpLang is specific to each operator invocation (akin to the stack space allocated for functions in C), and there is a separate "stack" which persists across operator invocations.

  Each cell in the tape(s) and stack is 1 byte, and overflow/underflow is allowed.

  The default size of the stack is 4KB, and the default size for each memory tape is 64KB. These can be modified via the command-line.

  ### Syntax

  OpLang has 10 "intrinsic" operators, 8 of which are the Brainfuck operators, with the same semantics:

  * `+`: Increment the current cell
  * `-`: Decrement the current cell
  * `<`: Move the current cell pointer to the left
  * `>`: Move the current cell pointer to the right
  * `,`: Read a character from stdin and store its ASCII value in the current cell
  * `.`: Interpret the current cell as an ASCII character and print it to stdout
  * `[`: Begin a loop (i.e. if the value at the current cell is zero, jump to the next `]`)
  * `]`: End a loop (i.e. if the value at the current cell is non-zero, jump to the previous `[`)

  And 2 of them are new operators that modify the stack:

  * `;`: Pop a value from the stack and store it into the current cell
  * `:`: Push the value of the current cell onto the stack

  An OpLang program consists of a series of custom operator definitions, followed by the "toplevel" (similar to a `main()` function in other languages).

  An operator definition consists of the operator's name, followed by the operator's body, enclosed in `{`/`}`.

  Single-line comments are supported, and are introduced by the `#` character.

  Here's a simple program that reads a character from stdin, adds 3 to it, and prints it back:

  ```oplang
  a { ; +++ : }
  ,: a ;.
  ```

  For more example programs, see the [examples](examples) folder.

  ## Compiler Architecture

  The compiler works by translating the input OpLang source into C, and then compiling that using the system's C compiler. To use a different C compiler, set the `CC` environment variable.

  The compiler uses an intermediate representation (which can be shown with the `--dump-ir` option) on which it performs a number of optimizations, generating C code that is much smaller and faster than a direct translation would be.
