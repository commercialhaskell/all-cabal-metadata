  # Revision history for opencc-hs

  ## 0.1.2.0 -- 2024-6-19

  * Bumped version upper bounds, and will be compatible with newer ghc versions.
  * `text` now requires at least version 2.0. text 2's internal encoding is now UTF-8, which means you enjoy much faster (i.e. usually zero-copy) `Text` conversion.
  * No longer throws when OpenCC returns invalid characters; instead, replace them with U+FFFD. This is the more useful behavior for user-facing texts.

  ## 0.1.1.0 -- 2022-2-5

  * Added `opencc` to `extra-libraries` in the cabal file to avoid surprises that a downstream consumer of this binding has to link opencc manually.
  * Relaxed version upper bounds.

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2021-05-18

  * Conversion functions now take 'Data.Text's and return 'Data.Text's, assuming the input text is valid UTF-8.

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2021-05-17

  * First release of OpenCC-hs. It features raw bindings and three styles of higher-level bindings: (1) one-shot, (2) IO handle, (3) monadic.

description: "# opencc-hs\n\n[中文版](./README.zh.md)\n\nThis library contains both high-level
  and low-level bindings to [OpenCC](https://github.com/BYVoid/OpenCC), Open Chinese
  Convert. \n\n⚠️ This library is not battle-tested. Please don't hesitate report
  any problems you find.\n\n## Comparison\n\n[hopencc](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hopencc)
  is an existing Haskell library that does the same thing, but that library only provides
  the IO-flavor binding here. hopencc copies the data, while opencc-hs doesn't (taking
  advantage of the internal representation of bytestrings).\n"
