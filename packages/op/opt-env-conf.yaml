  # Changelog

  ## [0.4.0.4] - 2024-07-28

  ### Added

  * Added a lint for examples that none of the configuration codecs can decode.

  ### Changed

  * Fixed: linter would 'catch' unreadable examples even though a setting would only read a configuration value

  ## [0.4.0.3] - 2024-07-28

  ### Changed

  * Support (commands [..] <|> commands [..]) by concat-ing the lists of commands.
  * Improved the documentation of parsers that use `some`.

  ## [0.4.0.2] - 2024-07-27

  ### Changed

  * Fixed a bug in which unrecognised arguments would be parsed exponentially.
  * The special `--version` command no longer allows any other arguments.
  * Fixed a bug in which some source locations still showed up even though debug mode was not on.
  * Fixed that only one codec for a configuration setting was tried.

  ## [0.4.0.1] - 2024-07-26

  ### Added

  * The `viaCodec` reader.

  ## [0.4.0.0] - 2024-07-23

  ### Added

  * Added a hidden `--render-reference-documentation` command.
  * Added a per-command `--help` page.

  ### Changed

  * Changed the name of `mkSettingsCheck` to `makeSettingsCheck`.

  ## [0.3.0.0] - 2024-07-19

  ### Changed

  * Debug mode now provides much more info about all the settings that were and weren't parsed, and why.
  * Fixed a bug in which arguments that were consumed in a failed branch were not being unconsumed afterwards.
  * Nix functions now produce completion as well as man pages.

  ## [0.2.0.0] -- 2024-07-18

  ### Changed

  * Fixed that the settings check could not be run with arguments.
  * Added a lint to check that `long` isn't used without `option` or `switch`.
  * Added a lint to check that `many` cannot be used with a parser that can succeed without consuming anything.

  ## [0.1.0.0] - 2024-07-16

  ### Changed

  * `xdgYamlConfigFile` now returns a `Path Abs File` instead of a `FilePath`.
  * Fixed a bug in `withFirstYamlConfig` and `withCombinedYamlConfig` in which the `--config-file` option was required.
  * `--run-settings-check` now allows you to define a static settings check.
  * Parse the combination of optional switches and optional arguments correctly.
  * Fail to parse if any arguments are leftover.

  ## [0.0.0.0] - 2024-07-08
