  # Changelog

  ## [0.3.0.0] - 2024-07-19

  ### Changed

  * Debug mode now provides much more info about all the settings that were and weren't parsed, and why.
  * Fixed a bug in which arguments that were consumed in a failed branch were not being unconsumed afterwards.
  * Nix functions now produce completion as well as man pages.

  ## [0.2.0.0] -- 2024-07-18

  ### Changed

  * Fixed that the settings check could not be run with arguments.
  * Added a lint to check that `long` isn't used without `option` or `switch`.
  * Added a lint to check that `many` cannot be used with a parser that can succeed without consuming anything.

  ## [0.1.0.0] - 2024-07-16

  ### Changed

  * `xdgYamlConfigFile` now returns a `Path Abs File` instead of a `FilePath`.
  * Fixed a bug in `withFirstYamlConfig` and `withCombinedYamlConfig` in which the `--config-file` option was required.
  * `--run-settings-check` now allows you to define a static settings check.
  * Parse the combination of optional switches and optional arguments correctly.
  * Fail to parse if any arguments are leftover.
