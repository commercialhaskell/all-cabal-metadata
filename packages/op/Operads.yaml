description: ! 'This is an implementation of the operadic Buchberger algorithm from
  Vladimir Dotsenko &

  Anton Khoroshkin: Groebner bases for operads (arXiv:0812.4069).


  In writing this package, invaluable help has been given by Vladimir Dotsenko and
  Eric Hoffbeck.


  The user is recommended to run this from within the GHC interpreter

  for exploration, and to write small Haskell scripts for batch

  processing. We hope herewithin to give enough of an overview of the

  available functionality to help the user figure out how to use the

  software package.


  A declaration of a new variable is done in a Haskell script by a

  statement on the form


  @

  var = value

  @


  and in the interpreter by a statement on the form


  @

  let var = value

  @


  Using these, the following instructions should help get you started. I will be writing

  the instructions aiming for use in the interpreter, for quick starts.


  It is possible to force types by following a declaration by :: and the type signature

  you''ll which. This enables you, for instance, to pick a ground ring without having
  to set

  coefficients explicitly - see the examples below.


  Note that the Buchberger algorithm in its current shape expects at least a division
  ring

  as scalar ring.


  The expected workflow for a normal user is as follows.


  1. write the generators of the operadic ideal using ''corolla'' and ''leaf'' to
  construct

  buildingblocks and ''nsCompose'', ''shuffleCompose'' and ''symmetricCompose'' to
  assemble

  them into trees. The trees, subsequently, may be assembled into tree polynomials
  by


  * picking an ordering. The orderings available are

  ''PathPerm'', ''RPathPerm'', ''PathRPerm'', ''RPathRPerm'',

  ''PermPath'', ''RPermPath'', ''PermRPath'' and ''RPermRPath'', distinguished by
  reversal

  of order for either the path comparison or the permutation comparison, as well as

  by whether path or permutation comparison takes precedence.


  * assembling trees and coefficients into an element of the free operad, using ''+''
  for

  addition of operadic elements and ''.*.'' for scalar multiplication.


  Useful functions for doing this includes, furthermore:


  [@''oet''@] takes a tree and an ordering and gives an operad element. You will have
  to

  specify the relevant type for this to work -- but we provide the extra type

  ''FreeOperad'' that only asks for a /LabelType/ to cover most common uses:


  @

  oet tree :: OperadElement /LabelType/ /ScalarType/ /TreeOrdering/

  @


  [@''oek''@] takes a tree, an ordering and a coefficient and gives an operad element


  @

  oek tree PathPerm (3::Rational)

  @


  Example:


  @

  let t1 = nsCompose 1 (corolla ''a'' [2,1]) (corolla ''b'' [1,2])


  let b = corolla ''l'' [1,2]


  let lb1 = shuffleCompose 1 [1,2,3] b b


  let lb2 = shuffleCompose 1 [1,3,2] b b


  let lb3 = shuffleCompose 2 [1,2,3] b b


  let lo1 = oet lb1 :: FreeOperad Char


  let lo2 = oet lb2 :: FreeOperad Char


  let lo3 = oet lb3 :: FreeOperad Char

  @


  Note that while the Haskell compiler in general is very skilled at guessing types
  of objects,

  the system guessing will give up if the type is not well defined. There are several
  different

  monomial orders allowed, and they are encoded in the type system -- hence the need
  to annotate

  the instantiation of elements in the free operad with appropriate types.


  2. assemble all generators into a list. Lists are formed by enclosing the elements,

  separated by commas, in square brackets. Lists must have identical type on all its

  elements - hence, for instance, you cannot have operadic elements with different
  monomial

  orderings in the same list.


  Example:


  @

  let lgb = [lo1 - lo2 - lo3, 2.*.lo1 + 3.*. lo3]

  @


  3. run the algorithm on your basis and wait for it to finish. The entry point to
  the Buchberger

  algorithm is, not surprisingly, ''operadicBuchberger''.


  Example:


  @

  let grobner = operadicBuchberger lgb

  @


  The output of ''operadicBuchberger'', if it finishes, is a finite Gröbner basis
  for the ideal spanned

  by the original generators. If this is quadratic then the operad presented by this
  ideal is Koszul -

  this may be tested with something like:


  @

  all (==2) $ concatMap operationDegrees grobner

  @


  If you wish to inspect elements yourself, the recommended way to do it is by using
  the ''pP'' function,

  which outputs most of the interesting elements in a human-readable format. For objects
  that don''t work

  with pP, just writing the variable name on its own will print it in some format.


  The difference here is related to the ability to save computational states to disk.
  There are two

  different functions that will represent a tree or an element of an operad as a String:
  ''show'' and ''pp''.

  Using the former guarantees (with the same version of the source code) that the
  data can be read back

  into the system and reused later one; whereas using ''pp'' will build a human readable
  string.'
