description: |-
  Provides tools to create command line parsers. The library has a simple
  interface to create atomic parsers and combine them into more complex
  structures. The interface has a low-level feel but still lets you solve
  common use-cases with minimal work.

  Has support for:

  * Generating a help screen.
  * Multi-argument options.
  * Short flags with bundling.
  * Subcommands via '<|>'.
  * Parsing "in sequence" via '<*>' and "in parallel" via '<#>'.
  * Options with custom types via '<$?>'.
  * Monadic bind if you need it.
