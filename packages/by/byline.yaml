  # Version History

  ## 1.0.0.0 (July 27, 2020)

  This version is the result of a major refactoring of the code in order
  to produce an MTL-compatible library.

    - New MTL-style class: `MonadByline`

    - Proper monad transformer: `BylineT`

    - Most of the library is under a single import: `Byline`

    - Added a `ToStylizedText` class to enable using custom types with
      functions like `menu`.

    - New `Byline.Exit.die` function to exit the current process with a
      stylized error message.  Thanks to the `ToStylizedText` class it's
      easy to exit with custom error types.

    - The `Report` type and associated functions were superfluous and
      therefore removed.  (Consider using the new `die` and `warn`
      functions in `Byline.Exit`.)

    - Menus now use `NonEmpty` to represent items and therefore the menu
      `Choice` type has been simplified, removing the `NoItems`
      constructor.

    - Fixed a bug where `Stylized Text` was not rendered when using one
      of the `ask*` functions (#1).

    - Proper encoding of escape sequences so Haskeline doesn't
      [print garbage](https://github.com/judah/haskeline/issues/130) on Windows.

    - Added support for RGB terminals

    - Added an implementation of 'MonadByline' that uses simulated user
      input to test your Byline code.

  ## 0.4.0.0 (March 17, 2020)

    - The `askUntil` function is now polymorphic in its return type.
      This allows the confirmation function to change the return type.

    - Removed `Data.Monoid` backwards compatibility for older GHCs.

    - Update dependency bounds

  ## 0.3.2.1 (April 15, 2019)

    - Update dependency bounds

    - Builds on NixOS 18.09, 19.03, and unstable

  ## 0.3.2.0 (October 09, 2018)

    - Update dependency bounds

  ## 0.3.1.0 (March 20, 2018)

    - Update dependency bounds

    - Deal with the Semigroup Monoid Proposal

  ## 0.3.0.0 (December 1, 2017)

    - New style modifier: `swapFgBg` (Thanks to Sam Tay)

    - `Byline` is now an instance of `MonadTrans` (Thanks to Sam Tay)

  ## 0.2.4.0 (March 19, 2017)

    - Update dependency bounds

    - Add Travis CI build status for supported versions of GHC

  ## 0.2.3.0 (November 1, 2016)

    - Increase upper bound on transformers package to `0.5` (Thanks to
      slycelote).

  ## 0.2.2.0 (June 9, 2016)

    - Build under LTS-5.15

  ## 0.2.1.0 (November 5, 2014)

    - Updated dependencies

  ## 0.2.0.0 (May 22, 2015)

    - Added the NoItems constructor for Choice to deal with menus that
      are asked to display an empty list.

    - Changes to build with GHC 7.8.4. and 7.10.1

  ## 0.1.0.0 (May 19, 2015)

    - Initial release.

  # Byline

  [![CI](https://github.com/pjones/byline/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pjones/byline/actions)
  [![GitHub tag (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/pjones/byline?label=release)](https://github.com/pjones/byline/releases)
  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/byline)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/byline)

  Byline simplifies writing interactive command-line applications by
  building upon [ansi-terminal][] and [haskeline][]. This makes it
  possible to print messages and prompts that include terminal escape
  sequences such as colors that are automatically disabled when standard
  input is a file. It also means that Byline works on both
  POSIX-compatible systems and on Windows.

  The primary features of Byline include printing messages, prompting
  for input, and generating custom menus. It was inspired by the
  [highline] Ruby library and the [terminal library][] by Craig Roche.

  ## Example Using `MonadByline`

  ```haskell
  example :: MonadByline m => m Text
  example = do
    sayLn ("Hey, I like " <> ("Haskell" <> fg magenta) <> "!")

    let question =
          "What's "
            <> ("your" <> bold)
            <> " favorite "
            <> ("language" <> fg green <> underline)
            <> "? "

    askLn question (Just "Haskell")
  ```

  ## Interfaces

    * The MTL interface lives in the [`byline`](byline) directory.

    * A `fused-effects` interface is forthcoming.
