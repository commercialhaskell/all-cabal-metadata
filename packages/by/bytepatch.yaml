changelog: |
  ## 0.4.1 (2023-02-15)
    * bump blake3 dependency to 0.3

  ## 0.4.0 (2022-07-08)
    * lots of refactoring, breaking, removing
    * clean up FunctorRec into standalone HFunctorList module
    * clean up HexBytestring into standalone module
    * add assembly patching (just ARMv8 Thumb LE for now)

  ## 0.3.1 (2021-12-21)
    * packaging improvements (documentation, CI)

  ## 0.3.0 (2021-12-18)
  Large internal refactoring.

    * Various concepts surrounding stream patching have been decoupled and
      parameterized. Pre-apply patch transformations are modelled as "metadata
      layers" which can be stripped off, and patch application functions require
      that no irrelevant metadata is present.
    * A new CLI inspired by the original tool exposes the useful bits.
    * Internally, the package is split into streampatch and bytepatch. If I could
      be bothered, they would be different packages, streampatch not requiring
      things like Aeson and Megaparsec.

  ## 0.2.1 (2021-12-03)
    * large internal refactoring (still more to come!)
    * schema refactoring (patch -> edit, offsets -> at)
    * Hackage metadata improvements (initial release was a bit wonky)

  ## 0.2.0 (2021-12-03)
  Initial release.

    * extracted & rewrote tool (library + CLI) from gtvm-hs

  # bytepatch
  A Haskell library and CLI tool for writing declarative patches over streams.
  Write **patchscripts** (in-place edits to a file) using a configurable YAML
  schema, and apply them with a safe patching algorithm. On the library side,
  define patches of various forms over any type, apply them to pure/impure
  streams, and write further patch data types and streams to extend as you like.

  bytepatch works with many data types:

    * read pretty binary `00 FF 1234`, parse to bytes
    * read text, re-encode, null-terminate to generate a C-style string
    * read assembly, assemble down to machine code

  The schema itself is highly configurable:

    * align: add a value (set in patch file) to each patch offset
    * compare: bytepatch can check expected data against actual during patching,
      to assert that you're patching the expected file. You can select how this
      check works: compare equality (exact, or match prefix), hashes
    * seek type: what the patch offsets mean. You'll likely want absolute
      offsets - but you may also write them as linear offsets, forward from the
      previous.

  You may also ask bytepatch to *compile* a patchscript, which reads it and then
  outputs a YAML file with a simplified schema: pre-aligned, compare via hashes,
  forward seeks.

  The bytepatch executable aims to be a general tool for reverse engineers, hoping
  to make simple binary & assembly editing more manageable. The Haskell library is
  quite sprawling, and has personally made for a fun investigation into type-level
  Haskell.

  ## What?
  If you're modifying binaries, you often end up needing to make edits in a hex
  editor. This is fun for a very short while, then you realise how easy it is to
  mess up.

  bytepatch is primarily intended as a developer tool for writing a
  *human-friendly static patchscript*. It provides a nice schema for defining
  edits to a binary file, so that developers can read and write patches in a
  structured, readable format. If one wanted, they could very easily read the
  patch file and use it to make the changes manually (though bytepatch wants to do
  this for you).

  bytepatch is not aimed at replacing binary patch tools such as IPS, BPS: these
  take an input and a result file, and generate a patch file that can be applied
  to the input in order to recreate the result. You need the result file in the
  first place. These tools both generate the patch file and apply it; bytepatch
  only applies the patch file, and leaves the writing to the user.

  ## When might I want to use this?
  You might find bytepatch useful if you want to define edits to be made on binary
  files (especially executables) that are *static* and *in-place*. Examples are:

    * instruction patching (via assembly)
    * string patching (via text)

  ### Less relevant use cases
  You can't use bytepatch directly for edits which are dynamic in nature (e.g.
  you need to read a file header in order to know what to change). *(You could
  have a patch preparer that does the dynamic work and emits a bytepatch patch,
  but this tool is largely focused the patch representation, so you wouldn't be
  gaining much.)*

  You can't use bytepatch to make edits that aren't in-place. Edits are located
  using stream offsets. Allowing edits to change the length of the segment they
  replace would introduce issues for following edits: do we use the original
  offset, or do we implicitly shift them so they still write to the "same place"?
  There *is* some support in the library for such edits, however, and it would be
  interesting to explore.
