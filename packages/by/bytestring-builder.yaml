description: |-
  This is the bytestring builder that is debuting in bytestring-0.10.4.0, which
  should be shipping with GHC 7.8, probably late in 2013.  This builder has
  several nice simplifications and improvements, and more out-of-box
  functionality than the older blaze-builder.

  Note that this package detects which version of bytestring you are compiling
  against,  and if you are compiling against bytestring-0.10.4 or later, will
  be an empty package.

  This package lets the new interface and implementation be used with most
  older compilers without upgrading bytestring, which can be rather
  problematic.  In conjunction with blaze-builder-0.4 or later,  which
  offers an implementation of blaze-builder in terms of bytestring-builder,
  this should let most people try the new interface and implementation without
  causing undue compatibility problems with packages that depend on
  blaze-builder.

  GHC 7.6 did debut an almost identical interface and implementation, but with
  slightly different module names and organization.   Trying to re-export/rename
  the builder provided with 7.6 did not turn out to be very practical,  because
  this interface includes new functions that rely on Builder internals,
  which are not exported in 7.6.  Furthermore, these module names should be
  deprecated in 7.10.
