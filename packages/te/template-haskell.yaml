synopsis: Support library for Template Haskell
changelog: ! "# Changelog for [`template-haskell` package](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/template-haskell)\n\n##
  2.11.1.0  Jan 2017\n\n  * Bundled with GHC 8.0.2\n\n  * Fix pretty-printing of list
  comprehensions with only one statement. Previously this was rendered as `[Foo|]`
  instead of `Foo]`.\n\n\n## 2.11.0.0  May 2016\n\n  * Bundled with GHC 8.0.1\n\n
  \ * The compiler can now resolve infix operator fixities in types on its own.\n
  \   The `UInfixT` constructor of `Type` is analoguous to `UInfixE` for expressions\n
  \   and can contain a tree of infix type applications which will be reassociated\n
  \   according to the fixities of the operators. The `ParensT` constructor can be\n
  \   used to explicitly group expressions.\n\n  * Add `namePackage` and `nameSpace`\n\n
  \ * Make `dataToQa` and `dataToExpQ` able to handle `Data` instances whose\n    `toConstr`
  implementation relies on a function instead of a data\n    constructor (#10796)\n\n
  \ * Add `Show` instances for `NameFlavour` and `NameSpace`\n\n  * Remove `FamilyD`
  and `FamFlavour`.  Add `DataFamilyD` and `OpenTypeFamilyD`\n    as the representation
  of data families and open type families\n    respectively. (#6018)\n\n  * Add `TypeFamilyHead`
  for common elements of `OpenTypeFamilyD` and\n    `ClosedTypeFamilyD` (#10902)\n\n
  \ * The `Strict` datatype was split among different datatypes: three for\n    writing
  the strictness information of data constructors' fields as denoted\n    in Haskell
  source code (`SourceUnpackedness` and `SourceStrictness`, as\n    well as `Bang`),
  and one for strictness information after a constructor is\n    compiled (`DecidedStrictness`).
  `Strict`, `StrictType` and `VarStrictType`\n    have been deprecated in favor of
  `Bang`, `BangType` and `VarBangType`, and\n    three functions (`isStrict`, `isLazy`,
  and `unpack`) were removed because\n    they no longer serve any use in this new
  design. (#10697)\n\n  * Add `reifyConStrictness` to query a data constructor's `DecidedStrictness`\n
  \   values for its fields (#10697)\n\n  * The `ClassOpI`, `DataConI`, and `VarI`
  constructors no longer have a\n    `Fixity` field. Instead, all `Fixity` information
  for a given `Name` is\n    now determined through the `reifyFixity` function, which
  returns `Just` the\n    fixity if there is an explicit fixity declaration for that
  `Name`, and\n    `Nothing` otherwise (#10704 and #11345)\n\n  * Add `MonadFail Q`
  instance for GHC 8.0 and later (#11661)\n\n  * TODO: document API changes and important
  bugfixes\n\n  * Add support for OVERLAP(S/PED/PING) pragmas on instances\n\n\n##
  2.10.0.0  *Mar 2015*\n\n  * Bundled with GHC 7.10.1\n  * Remove build-dependency
  on `containers` package\n  * Make `Pred` a type synonym of `Type`, and deprecate
  `classP`/`equalP` (#7021)\n  * Add support for `LINE` pragma via `prageLineD` and
  `LineP`\n  * Replace `Int#` with `!Int` in `NameFlavour` constructors\n  * Derive
  `Generic` for TH types (#9527)\n  * Add `standaloneDerivD` (#8100)\n  * Add support
  for generic default signatures via `defaultSigD` (#9064)\n  * Add `Lift` instances
  for `()` and `Rational`\n  * Derive new `Show` and `Data` instances for `Loc`\n
  \ * Derive `Eq` instances for `Loc`, `Info`, and `ModuleInfo`\n  * Make calling
  conventions available in template haskell consistent\n    with those from GHC (#9703)\n
  \ * Add support for `-XStaticValues` via `staticE`\n  * Add `Ord` instances to TH
  types\n  * Merge some instances from `th-orphans` (`Ppr` instances for `Lit`\n    and
  `Loc` as well as `Lift` instances for numeric types\n  * Put parens around `(ty
  :: kind)` when pretty-printing TH syntax\n"
