synopsis: Support library for Template Haskell
changelog: ! "# Changelog for [`template-haskell` package](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/template-haskell)\n\n##
  2.14.0.0 *August 2018*\n\n  * Introduce an `addForeignFilePath` function, as well
  as a corresponding\n    `qAddForeignFile` class method to `Quasi`. Unlike `addForeignFile`,
  which\n    takes the contents of the file as an argument, `addForeignFilePath` takes\n
  \   as an argument a path pointing to a foreign file. A new `addForeignSource`\n
  \   function has also been added which takes a file's contents as an argument.\n\n
  \   The old `addForeignFile` function is now deprecated in favor of\n    `addForeignSource`,
  and the `qAddForeignFile` method of `Quasi` has been\n    removed entirely.\n\n
  \ * Introduce an `addTempFile` function, as well as a corresponding\n    `qAddTempFile`
  method to `Quasi`, which requests a temporary file of\n    a given suffix.\n\n  *
  Add a `ViaStrategy` constructor to `DerivStrategy`.\n\n## 2.13.0.0 *March 2018*\n\n
  \ * Bundled with GHC 8.4.1\n\n  * `Language.Haskell.TH.FamFlavour`, which was deprecated
  in 2.11,\n    has been removed.\n\n  * Add support for overloaded labels. Introduces
  `labelE :: String -> ExpQ`.\n\n  * Add `KindQ`, `TyVarBndrQ`, and `FamilyResultSigQ`
  aliases to\n    `Language.Haskell.TH.Lib`.\n\n  * Add `Language.Haskell.TH.Lib.Internal`
  module, which exposes some\n    additional functionality that is used internally
  in GHC's integration\n    with Template Haskell. This is not a part of the public
  API, and as\n    such, there are no API guarantees for this module from version
  to version.\n\n  * `MonadIO` is now a superclass of `Quasi`, `qRunIO` has a default\n
  \   implementation `qRunIO = liftIO`\n\n  * Add `MonadIO Q` instance\n\n## 2.12.0.0
  *July 2017*\n\n  * Bundled with GHC 8.2.1\n\n  * Add support for pattern synonyms.
  This introduces one new constructor to\n    `Info` (`PatSynI`), two new constructors
  to `Dec` (`PatSynD` and\n    `PatSynSigD`), and two new data types (`PatSynDir`
  and `PatSynArgs`),\n    among other changes. (#8761)\n\n  * Add support for unboxed
  sums. (#12478)\n\n  * Add support for visible type applications. (#12530)\n\n  *
  Add support for attaching deriving strategies to `deriving` statements\n    (#10598)\n\n
  \ * Add support for `COMPLETE` pragmas. (#13098)\n\n  * `unboxedTupleTypeName` and
  `unboxedTupleDataName` now work for unboxed\n    0-tuples and 1-tuples (#12977)\n\n
  \ * `Language.Haskell.TH` now reexports all of `Language.Haskell.TH.Lib`.\n    (#12992).
  This causes `Language.Haskell.TH` to export more types and\n    functions that it
  did before:\n    - `TExp`, `BangQ`, and `FieldExpQ`\n    - `unboxedTupP`, `unboxedTupE`
  and `unboundVarE`\n    - `infixLD`, `infixRD`, and `infixND`\n    - `unboxedTupleT`
  and `wildCardT`\n    - `plainTV` and `kindedTV`\n    - `interruptible` and `funDep`\n
  \   - `valueAnnotation`, `typeAnnotation`, and `moduleAnnotation`\n\n  * Add support
  for overloaded labels.\n\n## 2.11.0.0  *May 2016*\n\n  * Bundled with GHC 8.0.1\n\n
  \ * The compiler can now resolve infix operator fixities in types on its own.\n
  \   The `UInfixT` constructor of `Type` is analoguous to `UInfixE` for expressions\n
  \   and can contain a tree of infix type applications which will be reassociated\n
  \   according to the fixities of the operators. The `ParensT` constructor can be\n
  \   used to explicitly group expressions.\n\n  * Add `namePackage` and `nameSpace`\n\n
  \ * Make `dataToQa` and `dataToExpQ` able to handle `Data` instances whose\n    `toConstr`
  implementation relies on a function instead of a data\n    constructor (#10796)\n\n
  \ * Add `Show` instances for `NameFlavour` and `NameSpace`\n\n  * Remove `FamilyD`
  and `FamFlavour`.  Add `DataFamilyD` and `OpenTypeFamilyD`\n    as the representation
  of data families and open type families\n    respectively. (#6018)\n\n  * Add `TypeFamilyHead`
  for common elements of `OpenTypeFamilyD` and\n    `ClosedTypeFamilyD` (#10902)\n\n
  \ * The `Strict` datatype was split among different datatypes: three for\n    writing
  the strictness information of data constructors' fields as denoted\n    in Haskell
  source code (`SourceUnpackedness` and `SourceStrictness`, as\n    well as `Bang`),
  and one for strictness information after a constructor is\n    compiled (`DecidedStrictness`).
  `Strict`, `StrictType` and `VarStrictType`\n    have been deprecated in favor of
  `Bang`, `BangType` and `VarBangType`.\n    (#10697)\n\n  * Add `reifyConStrictness`
  to query a data constructor's `DecidedStrictness`\n    values for its fields (#10697)\n\n
  \ * The `ClassOpI`, `DataConI`, and `VarI` constructors no longer have a\n    `Fixity`
  field. Instead, all `Fixity` information for a given `Name` is\n    now determined
  through the `reifyFixity` function, which returns `Just` the\n    fixity if there
  is an explicit fixity declaration for that `Name`, and\n    `Nothing` otherwise
  (#10704 and #11345)\n\n  * Add `MonadFail Q` instance for GHC 8.0 and later (#11661)\n\n
  \ * Add support for OVERLAP(S/PED/PING) pragmas on instances\n\n\n## 2.10.0.0  *Mar
  2015*\n\n  * Bundled with GHC 7.10.1\n  * Remove build-dependency on `containers`
  package\n  * Make `Pred` a type synonym of `Type`, and deprecate `classP`/`equalP`
  (#7021)\n  * Add support for `LINE` pragma via `prageLineD` and `LineP`\n  * Replace
  `Int#` with `!Int` in `NameFlavour` constructors\n  * Derive `Generic` for TH types
  (#9527)\n  * Add `standaloneDerivD` (#8100)\n  * Add support for generic default
  signatures via `defaultSigD` (#9064)\n  * Add `Lift` instances for `()` and `Rational`\n
  \ * Derive new `Show` and `Data` instances for `Loc`\n  * Derive `Eq` instances
  for `Loc`, `Info`, and `ModuleInfo`\n  * Make calling conventions available in template
  haskell consistent\n    with those from GHC (#9703)\n  * Add support for `-XStaticValues`
  via `staticE`\n  * Add `Ord` instances to TH types\n  * Merge some instances from
  `th-orphans` (`Ppr` instances for `Lit`\n    and `Loc` as well as `Lift` instances
  for numeric types\n  * Put parens around `(ty :: kind)` when pretty-printing TH
  syntax\n"
