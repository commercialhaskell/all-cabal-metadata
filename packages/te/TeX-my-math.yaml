  For tl;dr: look at <https://github.com/leftaroundabout/Symbolic-math-HaTeX/blob/master/EXAMPLES.md>.

  This is an attempt to get convenient math syntax in HaTeX (i.e., in data structures
  compatible \/ convertable to those from <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/HaTeX>).

  The idea is to combine these features:

  * Full access to the math-typesetting power of LaTeX. It should be possible to express
  any formula that might be found in a typical mathematics or physics journal article.
  This should also include expression which are not quite well-defined from a programming
  point of view, but are clear to the intended audience.

  * Idiomatic Haskell syntax. Who wants to bother with unreadable expressions involving
  either hundreds of double-backslashes or extra syntax overhead in wrapping them
  explicitly into HaTeX?

  Ideally, one would write expressions as if only meaning Haskell to /calculate/ them,
  but get the result back as a full pretty-printing LaTeX math string. /And the actual
  calculated result as well/, if possible!

  To this end, we use a minimal symbolic-manipulation EDSL, namely
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/dumb-cas dumb-cas>, set up in a way so the
  leaves of the syntax tree, i.e. the individual symbols, are represented by LaTeX
  expressions in memory and by single-letter variables in the Haskell code.
  These can then be combined with operators corresponding to LaTeX's maths operators,
  to obtain a very compact and almost WYSIWYG-like code appearance, while retaining
  the ability to apply any LaTeX-specific tweaks whenever necessary. At the same
  time, because the AST is fully precedence-aware, it is safely possible to transform
  the expressions via e.g. Template Haskell, to actually compute concrete numerical
  results, or apply exact symbolic-manipulation techniques.
