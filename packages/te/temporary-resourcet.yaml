description: |-
  The functions for creating temporary files and directories in the base
  library are quite limited. The @unixutils@ package contains some good ones,
  but they aren't portable to Windows.

  This library repackages the Cabal implementations of its own temporary file
  and folder functions so that you can use them without linking against Cabal
  or depending on it being installed.

  This library provides the same functionality as the @temporary@ package, but
  uses @resourcet@ to provide automatic deletion without nesting @withTempFile@.
