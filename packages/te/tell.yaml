description: |-
  @MonadTell@ is (morally) a superclass of @MonadWriter@ that only provides @tell@.
  In contrast to @MonadWriter@, implementors of @MonadTell@ are not required to hold
  on to their output. This means that @MonadTell@ is a better choice in situations
  such as logging and writing to files.
