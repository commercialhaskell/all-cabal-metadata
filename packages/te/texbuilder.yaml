description: ! "# texbuilder\n## What it is\n\nThis program allows you to view your
  latex document in your pdf\nreader while editing it in your favorite editor. When
  you save\nyour document, it will recompile it, overwrite the output pdf file\nand
  send a signal to your pdf reader to reload the file.\nThis effectively allows for
  a \"continuous preview\"-like experience.\n\nThis will run with *mupdf* and *only
  on Linux* at the moment.\n\n## Prerequisites and Dependencies\n  * linux (we use
  inotify)\n  * a recent cabal / ghc\n  * (currently only works with) mupdf\n  * working
  latex with lualatex, xelatex or pdflatex and ideally latexmk\n  * make sure to compile
  this with the -threaded ghc option, otherwise it will not work!\n\n## Build with
  Cabal from Hackage\n\n```sh\ncabal install --bindir . --ghc-option=-threaded texbuilder\n```\n\n##
  How to build from git\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://gitlab.com/xaverdh/tex-builder\ncd
  tex-builder\ncabal sandbox init\ncabal install --bindir . --ghc-option=-threaded\n```\nAlternatively
  you can use the provided [build script][build-script].\nSo assuming you have wget
  you cound do:\n\n```sh\nwget -O - https://gitlab.com/xaverdh/tex-builder/raw/master/build
  | sh\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nSay you want to compile a tex file thesis.tex then standard
  usage would be:\n```sh\ntexbuilder -t thesis.tex\n```\nBy default texbuilder will
  use a fresh environment for every compile run. This may\nsound wasteful, but is
  quite feasible with average sized tex files on modern hardware.\nAnd it does avoid
  problems with messed up state, when something goes wrong.\n\nStill if you do have
  problems with performance, use the ` --stateful ` flag.\n\nFinally if you really
  really need all those intermediate representation files\nin your directory, use
  ` --persistent `.\n\n## Notes\n\nEarly Versions (up to 0.1.2.0) of this program
  are deprecated, because the cabal file did not enforce use of the ` -threaded `
  ghc option. If that option was not passed to cabal / ghc on the command line, the
  resulting builds were broken.\n\n## Legal\n\nThis program is free software: you
