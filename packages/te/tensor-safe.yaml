description: "# Tensor Safe\n\n`tensor-safe` is a dependently typed framework to define
  deep learning models which structure is verified on\ncompilation time. If the models
  are valid, these can be compiled to Keras framework in Python or JavaScript.\n\n##
  Building instructions and development tools\n\n1. Install `ghc-mod`, `hpack` and
  `stylish-haskell` with `stack install`\n\n   ```\n   cd ~\n   stack install ghc-mod
  hpack stylish-haskell\n   ```\n\n2. Run `stack build` in project folder\n3. Install
  `Intero`\n\n   Run `stack build intero` in the project folder\n\n   Ref: https://gitlab.com/vannnns/haskero/blob/master/client/doc/installation.md\n\n##
  Generate `.cabal` file\n\nRun `hpack` in the root of the project and the file `tensor-safe.cabal`
  will be generated\n\n## Model definition\n\nModels can be defined as a type using
  the `MkINetwork` type function. The `MkINetwork` defines a\nvalid instance of a
  Network model given a list of `Layers` and a spected input and iutput `Shapes`.\n\nHere's
  an example of how to define a simple model for the `MNIST` dataset, using `Dense`
  layers:\n\n```haskell\ntype MNIST = MkINetwork\n    '[\n        Flatten,\n        Dense
  784 42,\n        Relu,\n        Dense 42 10,\n        Sigmoid\n    ]\n    ('D3 28
  28 1)    -- Input\n    ('D1 10)         -- Output\n```\n\nAfter that, variable with
  the model type can be verified with the function `mkINetwork` like this:\n\n```haskell\nmnist
  :: MNIST\nmnist = mkINetwork\n```\n\n## Nesting networks definitions\n\nYou can
  nest networks definitions easily by adding the networks as layers. For example,
  in the case of the `MNIST` model defined above, we can abstract the use of Dense
  and a activation function like this:\n\n```haskell\ntype DenseRelu i o =\n    MkINetwork
  '[ Dense i o, Relu ] ('D1 i) ('D1 o)\n\ntype DenseSigmoid i o =\n    MkINetwork
  '[ Dense i o, Sigmoid ] ('D1 i) ('D1 o)\n\ntype MNIST = MkINetwork\n    '[\n        Flatten,\n
  \       DenseRelu 784 42,\n        DenseSigmoid 42 10\n    ]\n    ('D3 28 28 1)
  \   -- Input\n    ('D1 10)         -- Output\n```\n\n## How to extend layers definitions\n\nSince
  this library only implements a subset of features that Keras implement, it's likely
  that for\nnew projects you'll need to add new layers. Due to the modularization
  of the library, this can be\ndone by adding the layer definitions in specific locations
  of the project:\n\n1. First, add a new auxiliary layer entry for the data type `DLayer`
  in `TensorSafe.Compile.Expr`.\n   This will make possible the compilation of the
  layer for all instances of `Generator`. Also, add\n   to the `LayerGenerator` entry
  for the newly added layer.\n2. Secondly, add the layer definition to the `TensorSafe/Layers`
  folder. You can copy the\n   definitions from the currently defined layers.\n3.
  Then, import and expose your layer definition in the `TensorSafe.Layers` module.\n4.
  Finally, declare how your layer transforms a specific Shape in the `Out` type function.\n\n##
  Command line interface\n\n> This interface will change in the near future\n\nYou
  can install `tensor-safe` command line tool by running `stack build`. Then you can
  use it by using `stack exec tensor-safe -- check --path ./path-to-model.hs` or `stack
  exec tensor-safe -- compile --path ./path-to-model.hs --module-name SomeModule`.\n\n##
  Tools for JavaScript environment\n\nAdd as development dependency the packages `babel-plugin-tensor-safe`
  and `eslint-plugin-tensor-safe`. These can be found in the `extra/javascript` folder
  in this project.\n\nYou can add them directly from this project like this:\n\n```bash\nyarn
  add --dev file/:<path-to-tensor-safe>/extra/javascript/babel-plugin-tensor-safe\n\nyarn
  add --dev file/:<path-to-tensor-safe>/extra/javascript/eslint-plugin-tensor-safe\n```\n\nThen
  add to the `.eslintrc.js` file in your JavaScript project the plugin `tensor-safe`
  and the rule `tensor-safe-model-invalid` like this:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n
  \ plugins: [\n     ...\n     \"tensor-safe\"\n   ],\n  ...\n  rules: {\n    ...\n
  \   \"tensor-safe/invalid-model\": 1\n    ...\n  }\n};\n```\n\nAnd for the Babel
  plugin add `\"@babel/plugin-tensor-safe\"` to the plugins list in the `.babelrc`
  file inside your JavaScript project.\n\nThen, you can write your deep learning model
  inside your JS files as in the following example:\n\n```js\nfunction createConvModel()
  {\n  safeModel`\n    '[\n        Conv2D 1 16 3 3 1 1,\n        Relu,\n        MaxPooling
  2 2 2 2,\n        Conv2D 16 32 3 3 1 1,\n        Relu,\n        MaxPooling 2 2 2
  2,\n        Conv2D 32 32 3 3 1 1,\n        Relu,\n        Flatten,\n        Dense
  288 64,\n        Sigmoid,\n        Dense 64 10,\n        Sigmoid\n    ]\n    ('D3
  28 28 1)  -- Input\n    ('D1 10)       -- Output\n`;\n\n  return model;\n}\n```\n\n##
  Related projects\n\nThis project was highly influenciated by [Grenade](https://github.com/HuwCampbell/grenade)
  \U0001F4A3.\nGrenade is a really cool library to define deep neural networks which
  are validated using dependent types.\nWhat differences TensorSafe from Grenade the
  most is that TensorSafe doesn't run nor train the models, instead\nit compiles the
  model to external languages that are capable of performing all computations – like
  Keras\nfor Python or JavaScript. Also, TensorSafe doesn't need to specifically declare
  all Shapes transformations\nfor all the model layers, instead, it just needs the
  `input` and `output` Shapes to validate the model.\n\nAnother worth looking library
  is [TensorFlow for Haskell](https://github.com/tensorflow/haskell).\nThis library
  has all bindings for TensorFlow in C. The issue with this is that it doesn't perform\na
  lot of type checkings at compilation time. However, there's an open branch that
  uses dependent\ntypes to solve many of these issues: https://github.com/helq/tensorflow-haskell-deptyped,
  but the\nsolution still seems rather complicated for real use.\n"
