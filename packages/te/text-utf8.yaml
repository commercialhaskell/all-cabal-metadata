  ### 1.2.3.0

  First released version of `text-utf8` package matching the API of `text-1.2.3.0`.
changelog-type: markdown
description: |2-

  An efficient packed, immutable UTF-8 backed Unicode text type (both strict and
  lazy), with a powerful loop fusion optimization framework.

  The 'Text' type represents Unicode character strings, in a time and
  space-efficient manner. This package provides text processing
  capabilities that are optimized for performance critical use, both
  in terms of large data quantities and high speed.

  The 'Text' type provides character-encoding, type-safe case
  conversion via whole-string case conversion functions (see "Data.Text").
  It also provides a range of functions for converting 'Text' values to
  and from 'ByteStrings', using several standard encodings
  (see "Data.Text.Encoding").

  Efficient locale-sensitive support for text IO is also supported
  (see "Data.Text.IO").

  These modules are intended to be imported qualified, to avoid name
  clashes with Prelude functions, e.g.

  > import qualified Data.Text as T

  == Relationship to the standard text package

  This is a fork of the [text](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text)
  package ported which uses UTF-8 instead of UTF-16 as its internal
  representation.

  This release is intended to be API compatible with the @text-1.2.3.0@ release.

  Another package providing an UTF-8 backed Text type with a diffferent cost-model
  is the [text-short](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-short) package.
