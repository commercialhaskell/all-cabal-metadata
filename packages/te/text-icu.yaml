  # Text-ICU: Comprehensive support for string manipulation

  This package provides the Data.Text.ICU library, for performing
  complex manipulation of Unicode text.  It provides features such as
  the following:

  * Unicode normalization

  * Conversion to and from many common and obscure encodings

  * Date and number formatting

  * Comparison and collation

  ## Prerequisites

  This library is implemented as bindings to the well-respected [ICU
  library](https://icu.unicode.org/) (which is not bundled, and must
  be installed separately).

  ### macOS

      brew install icu4c
      brew link icu4c --force

  You might need:

      export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$(brew --prefix)/opt/icu4c/lib/pkgconfig"

  ### Debian/Ubuntu

      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install libicu-dev

  ### Fedora/CentOS

      sudo dnf install unzip libicu-devel

  ### Nix/NixOS

      nix-shell --packages icu

  ### Windows/MSYS2

  Under MSYS2, `ICU` can be installed via `pacman`.

      pacman --noconfirm -S mingw-w64-x86_64-icu

  Depending on the age of the MSYS2 installation, the keyring might need
  to be updated to avoid certification issues, and `pkg-config` might
  need to be added.  In this case, do this first:

      pacman --noconfirm -Sy msys2-keyring
      pacman --noconfirm -S mingw-w64-x86_64-pkgconf

  ### Windows/stack

  With `stack` on Windows, which comes with its _own_ bundled MSYS2, the
  following commands give up-to-date system dependencies for
  `text-icu-0.8.0` (tested 2023-09-30):

      stack exec -- pacman --noconfirm -Sy msys2-keyring
      stack exec -- pacman --noconfirm -S mingw-w64-x86_64-pkgconf
      stack exec -- pacman --noconfirm -S mingw-w64-x86_64-icu


  ## Compatibility

  Upstream ICU occasionally introduces backwards-incompatible API
  breaks. This package tries to stay up to date with upstream, and is
  currently more or less in sync with ICU 72.

  Minimum required version is ICU 62.
