  # Text-ICU: Comprehensive support for string manipulation

  This package provides the Data.Text.ICU library, for performing
  complex manipulation of Unicode text.  It provides features such as
  the following:

  * Unicode normalization

  * Conversion to and from many common and obscure encodings

  * Date and number formatting

  * Comparison and collation

  # Prerequisites

  This library is implemented as bindings to the well-respected [ICU
  library](http://www.icu-project.org/) (which is not bundled, and must
  be installed separately).

  For Ubuntu `apt-get install libicu-dev` should suffice.


  # Compatibility

  Upstream ICU occasionally introduces backwards-incompatible API
  breaks.  This package tries to stay up to date with upstream, and is
  currently more or less in sync with ICU 69.


  # Get involved!

  Please report bugs via the
  [github issue tracker](https://github.com/haskell/text-icu/issues).
