description: "# Techlab - Bleeding Edge Prelude\n\nTechlab is a prelude aimed at maximising
  expressivity in Haskell.\n\nThis is intended for serious Haskell power users who
  don't mind the ground moving under them. \n\nTechlab values expressivity above all
  other concerns. We want to see how\nconvenient and natural domain modelling can
  be made in Haskell. That is, we\ndon't know exactly what the final form of this
  toolkit might look like, and we\nmake no guarantees that anything you might want
  in a prelude won't be\nsacrificed in pursuit of shinier language elements and ergonomics.\n\nTechlab
  currently contains re-exports of chassis, a wide range of polysemy libraries, dhall,\nformatting
  and optics. Hobbyists who like polysemy will probably feel right at home here, and\ncontributions
  are welcome.\n\nVery early release - nothing is namespaced well or comprehensively
  re-exported.\n"
