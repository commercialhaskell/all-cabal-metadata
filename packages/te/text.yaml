changelog: |
  ### 1.2.4.0

  * Add TH `Lift` instances for `Data.Text.Text` and `Data.Text.Lazy.Text` (gh-232)

  * Update Haddock documentation to better reflect fusion eligibility; improve fusion
    rules for `takeWhileEnd` and `length` (gh-241, ghc-202)

  * Optimise `Data.Text.replicate` from `O(n)` to `O(log n)` (gh-209)

  * Support `base-4.13.0.0`

  ### 1.2.3.1

  * Make `decodeUtf8With` fail explicitly for unsupported non-BMP
    replacement characters instead silent undefined behaviour (gh-213)

  * Fix termination condition for file reads via `Data.Text.IO`
    operations (gh-223)

  * A serious correctness issue affecting uses of `take` and `drop` with
    negative counts has been fixed (gh-227)

  * A bug in the case-mapping functions resulting in unreasonably large
    allocations with large arguments has been fixed (gh-221)

  ### 1.2.3.0

  * Spec compliance: `toCaseFold` now follows the Unicode 9.0 spec
    (updated from 8.0).

  * Bug fix: the lazy `takeWhileEnd` function violated the
    [lazy text invariant](https://github.com/bos/text/blob/1.2.3.0/Data/Text/Internal/Lazy.hs#L51)
    (gh-184).

  * Bug fix: Fixed usage of size hints causing incorrect behavior (gh-197).

  * New function: `unsnoc` (gh-173).

  * Reduce memory overhead in `encodeUTF8` (gh-194).

  * Improve UTF-8 decoder error-recovery (gh-182).

  * Minor documentation improvements (`@since` annotations, more
    examples, clarifications).

  #### 1.2.2.2

  * The `toTitle` function now correctly handles letters that
    immediately follow punctuation. Before, `"there's"` would turn into
    `"There'S"`. Now, it becomes `"There's"`.

  * The implementation of unstreaming is faster, resulting in operations
    such as `map` and `intersperse` speeding up by up to 30%, with
    smaller code generated.

  * The optimised length comparison function is now more likely to be
    used after some rewrite rule tweaking.

  * Bug fix: an off-by-one bug in `takeEnd` is fixed.

  * Bug fix: a logic error in `takeWord16` is fixed.

  #### 1.2.2.1

  * The switch to `integer-pure` in 1.2.2.0 was apparently mistaken.
    The build flag has been renamed accordingly.  Your army of diligent
    maintainers apologizes for the churn.

  * Spec compliance: `toCaseFold` now follows the Unicode 8.0 spec
    (updated from 7.0)

  * An STG lint error has been fixed

  ### 1.2.2.0

  * The `integer-simple` package, upon which this package optionally
    depended, has been replaced with `integer-pure`.  The build flag has
    been renamed accordingly.

  * Bug fix: For the `Binary` instance, If UTF-8 decoding fails during a
    `get`, the error is propagated via `fail` instead of an uncatchable
    crash.

  * New function: `takeWhileEnd`

  * New instances for the `Text` types:
      * if `base` >= 4.7: `PrintfArg`
      * if `base` >= 4.9: `Semigroup`

  #### 1.2.1.3

  * Bug fix: As it turns out, moving the literal rewrite rules to simplifier
    phase 2 does not prevent competition with the `unpack` rule, which is
    also active in this phase. Unfortunately this was hidden due to a silly
    test environment mistake. Moving literal rules back to phase 1 finally
    fixes GHC Trac #10528 correctly.

  #### 1.2.1.2

  * Bug fix: Run literal rewrite rules in simplifier phase 2.
    The behavior of the simplifier changed in GHC 7.10.2,
    causing these rules to fail to fire, leading to poor code generation
    and long compilation times. See
    [GHC Trac #10528](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/10528).

  #### 1.2.1.1

  * Expose unpackCString#, which you should never use.

  ### 1.2.1.0

  * Added Binary instances for both Text types. (If you have previously
    been using the text-binary package to get a Binary instance, it is
    now obsolete.)

  #### 1.2.0.6

  * Fixed a space leak in UTF-8 decoding

  #### 1.2.0.5

  * Feature parity: repeat, cycle, iterate are now implemented for lazy
    Text, and the Data instance is more complete

  * Build speed: an inliner space explosion has been fixed with toCaseFold

  * Bug fix: encoding Int to a Builder would infinite-loop if the
    integer-simple package was used

  * Deprecation: OnEncodeError and EncodeError are deprecated, as they
    are never used

  * Internals: some types that are used internally in fusion-related
    functions have moved around, been renamed, or been deleted (we don't
    bump the major version if .Internal modules change)

  * Spec compliance: toCaseFold now follows the Unicode 7.0 spec
    (updated from 6.3)

  #### 1.2.0.4

  * Fixed an incompatibility with base < 4.5

  #### 1.2.0.3

  * Update formatRealFloat to correspond to the definition in versions
    of base newer than 4.5 (https://github.com/bos/text/issues/105)

  #### 1.2.0.2

  * Bumped lower bound on deepseq to 1.4 for compatibility with the
    upcoming GHC 7.10

  #### 1.2.0.1

  * Fixed a buffer overflow in rendering of large Integers
    (https://github.com/bos/text/issues/99)

  ## 1.2.0.0

  * Fixed an integer overflow in the replace function
    (https://github.com/bos/text/issues/81)

  * Fixed a hang in lazy decodeUtf8With
    (https://github.com/bos/text/issues/87)

  * Reduced codegen bloat caused by use of empty and single-character
    literals

  * Added an instance of IsList for GHC 7.8 and above

  ### 1.1.1.0

  * The Data.Data instance now allows gunfold to work, via a virtual
    pack constructor

  * dropEnd, takeEnd: new functions

  * Comparing the length of a Text against a number can now
    short-circuit in more cases

  #### 1.1.0.1

  * streamDecodeUtf8: fixed gh-70, did not return all unconsumed bytes
    in single-byte chunks

  ## 1.1.0.0

  * encodeUtf8: Performance is improved by up to 4x.

  * encodeUtf8Builder, encodeUtf8BuilderEscaped: new functions,
    available only if bytestring >= 0.10.4.0 is installed, that allow
    very fast and flexible encoding of a Text value to a bytestring
    Builder.

    As an example of the performance gain to be had, the
    encodeUtf8BuilderEscaped function helps to double the speed of JSON
    encoding in the latest version of aeson! (Note: if all you need is a
    plain ByteString, encodeUtf8 is still the faster way to go.)

  * All of the internal module hierarchy is now publicly exposed.  If a
    module is in the .Internal hierarchy, or is documented as internal,
    use at your own risk - there are no API stability guarantees for
    internal modules!

  #### 1.0.0.1

  * decodeUtf8: Fixed a regression that caused us to incorrectly
    identify truncated UTF-8 as valid (gh-61)

  # 1.0.0.0

  * Added support for Unicode 6.3.0 to case conversion functions

  * New function toTitle converts words in a string to title case

  * New functions peekCStringLen and withCStringLen simplify
    interoperability with C functionns

  * Added support for decoding UTF-8 in stream-friendly fashion

  * Fixed a bug in mapAccumL

  * Added trusted Haskell support

  * Removed support for GHC 6.10 (released in 2008) and older

  # Authors

  The base code for this library was originally written by Tom Harper,
  based on the stream fusion framework developed by Roman Leshchinskiy,
  Duncan Coutts, and Don Stewart.

  The core library was fleshed out, debugged, and tested by Bryan
  O'Sullivan <bos@serpentine.com>, and he is the current maintainer.
