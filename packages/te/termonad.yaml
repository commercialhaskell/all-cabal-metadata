changelog: |
  ## 1.3.0.0

  * Change all uses of
    [`Colour`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/colour-2.3.5/docs/Data-Colour.html#t:Colour)
    to
    [`AlphaColour`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/colour-2.3.5/docs/Data-Colour.html#t:AlphaColour)
    in `Termonad.Config.Colour`.  Users should now use `AlphaColour` instead of
    `Colour`.  Also, all uses of `sRGB24` should be replaced with `createColour`.
    This change is mechanical and should not affect how Termonad works at all.
    Thanks to @jecaro and @amir! [#116](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/116)

  ## 1.2.0.0

  * Got the code for setting the backgroud color of the terminal actually
    working.  Thanks @dakotaclemenceplaza.
    [#111](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/111)
    * This changes the type of `ColourConfig` to make the foreground and
      background colors of the terminal optional.
  * Various cleanup in the nix files.

  ## 1.1.0.0

  * Added an
    [example](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/blob/0cd741d51958806092418b55abdf1c1dc078841c/example-config/ExampleSolarizedColourExtension.hs)
    of how to setup a solarized color scheme. Thanks @craigem.
    [#90](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/90) and [#103](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/103)
  * Various fixes in the nix files.
    * Make sure Termonad can see the GTK icons.
      [#91](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/91) and
      [#92](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/92)
  * Add a menu option to change the font size at runtime.  You should be able to
    do this with the `Ctrl-+` and `Ctrl--` keys.
    [#95](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/95)
  * Get building with GHC 8.6. Thanks @clinty. [#98](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/98)

  ## 1.0.1.0

  * Stop using the `widgetSetFocusOnClick` function, which is not supported on
    older versions of GTK. This lets Termonad be compiled with older versions
    of GTK. [#87](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/87).
  * Add CI. [#87](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/87).
  * Support versions of VTE-2.91 older than 0.44.
    [#87](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/87).
  * Add some functions for converting from a list to a `Vec` in
    `Termonad.Config.Vec`: `fromListVec` and `fromListVec_`.  Commit 883eb98b5f.
  * Fix the paste hotkey. [#86](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/86).

  ## 1.0.0.0

  * The API for configuring Termonad is now completely different. Many, many
    changes have gone into this version.  You should approach it as a
    completely different application.

    The CHANGELOG will be kept up-to-date for future releases.

  ## 0.2.1.0

  * Make sure the window title is set to "Termonad".
  * Relabel tabs when termonad is started.

  ## 0.2.0.0

  * Open dialog asking if you want to quit when you try to use your WM to quit.
  * Termonad will attempt to open up a new terminal in the working directory of
    the current terminal.
  * Make sure termonad won't crash if dyre can't find GHC.
  * Add a few more ways to compile on NixOS.
  * Add an icon for termonad.

  ## 0.1.0.0

  * Initial release.

  Termonad is a terminal emulator configurable in Haskell.  It is extremely
  customizable and provides hooks to modify the default behavior.  It can be
  thought of as the "XMonad" of terminal emulators.

  ## Installation

  Termonad can be installed on any system as long as the necessary GTK libraries
  are available.  The following are instructions for installing Termonad on a few
  different distributions and systems.  If the given steps don't work for you, or
  you want to add instructions for an additional system, please send a pull
  request.

  The following steps use the
  [`stack`](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) build tool to build
  Termonad, but [`cabal`](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) can be used as well. Steps for
  installing `stack` can be found on
  [this page](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/).


  ### Arch Linux

  First, you must install the required GTK system libraries:

  ```sh
  $ pacman -S vte3
  ```

  In order to install Termonad, clone this repository and run `stack install`.
  This will install the `termonad` binary to `~/.local/bin/`:

  ```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad
  $ cd termonad/
  $ stack install
  ```

  ### Ubuntu / Debian

  First, you must install the required GTK system libraries:

  ```sh
  $ apt-get install gobject-introspection libgirepository1.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libvte-2.91-dev
  ```

  In order to install Termonad, clone this repository and run `stack install`.
  This will install the `termonad` binary to `~/.local/bin/`:

  ```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad
  $ cd termonad/
  $ stack install
  ```

  ### Nix

  If you have `nix` installed, you should be able to use it to build Termonad.
  This means that it will work on NixOS, or with `nix` on another distro.  There
  are two different ways to use `nix` to build Termonad:

  The first is using `stack`.  The following commands install `stack` for your
  user, clone this repository, and install the `termonad` binary to `~/.local/bin/`:

  ```sh
  $ nix-env -i stack
  $ git clone https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad
  $ cd termonad/
  $ stack --nix install
  ```

  The second is using the normal `nix-build` machinery.  The following commands
  clone this repository and build the `termonad` binary at `./result/bin/`:

  ```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad
  $ cd termonad/
  $ nix-build
  ```

  ### Mac OS X

  Building and installing Termonad on Mac OS X should be possible with any of the following three methods:

  -   Install the required system libraries (like GTK and VTE) by hand, then use
      `stack` to build Termonad.

      This is probably the easiest method.  You don't have to understand anything
      about `nix`.  However, it is slightly annoying to have to install GTK and
      VTE by hand.

  -   Use `nix` to install both the required system libraries and Termonad itself.

      If you are a nix user and want an easy way to install Termonad, this
      is the recommended method.

  -   Use `nix` to install install the required system libraries, and `stack` to
      build Termonad.

      If you are a nix user, but want to use `stack` to actually do development
      on Termonad, using `stack` may be easier than using `cabal`.

  The following sections describe each method.

  #### Installing with just `stack`

  (*currently no instructions available.  please send a PR adding instructions if you get termonad to build using this method.*)

  #### Installing with just `nix`

  `nix` can be used to install Termonad with the following steps, assuming you
  have `nix` [installed](https://nixos.org/nix/download.html).  These commands
  clone this repository and build the `termonad` binary at `./result/bin/`:

  ```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad
  $ cd termonad/
  $ nix-build
  ```

  #### Installing with `stack` using `nix`

  `stack` can be used in conjunction with `nix` to install Termonad.  `nix` will
  handle installing system dependencies (like GTK and VTE), while `stack` will
  handle compiling and installing Haskell packages.

  You must have `nix` [installed](https://nixos.org/nix/download.html).

  You will also need `stack` installed.  You can do that with the following command:

  ```sh
  $ nix-env -i stack
  ```

  After `stack` is installed, you will need to clone Termonad and build it:

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad
  $ cd termonad/
  $ stack --nix install
  ```

  This will install the `termonad` binary to `~/.local/bin/`.

  ### Windows

  (*currently no instructions available.  please send a PR adding instructions if you get termonad to build.*)

  ## How to use Termonad

  Termonad is similar to XMonad. The above steps will install a `termonad` binary
  somewhere on your system. If you have installed Termonad using `stack`, the
  `termonad` binary will be in `~/.local/bin/`. This binary is a version of
  Termonad configured with default settings. You can try running it to get an idea
  of what Termonad is like:

  ```sh
  $ ~/.local/bin/termonad
  ```

  The following section describes the default key bindings.

  If you would like to configure Termonad with your own settings, first you will
  need to create a Haskell file called `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs`. A following
  section gives an example configuration file.

  If this configuration file exists, when the `~/.local/bin/termonad` binary
  launches, it will try to use GHC to compile the configuration file. If GHC
  is able to successfully compile the configuration file, a separate binary will
  be created called something like `~/.cache/termonad/termonad-linux-x86_64`.
  This binary file can be thought of as your own personal Termonad, configured
  with all your own settings.

  When you run `~/.local/bin/termonad`, it will re-exec
  `~/.cache/termonad/termonad-linux-x86_64` if it exists.

  However, there is one difficulty with this setup. In order for the
  `~/.local/bin/termonad` binary to be able to compile your
  `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs` configuration file, Termonad needs to know
  where GHC is, as well as where all your Haskell packages live. This presents
  some difficulties that will be discussed in a following section.

  ### Default Key Bindings

  Termonad provides the following default key bindings.

  | Key binding | Action |
  |------------|--------|
  | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>t</kbd> | Open new tab. |
  | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>w</kbd> | Close tab. |
  | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>+</kbd> | Increase font size. |
  | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>-</kbd> | Decrease font size. |
  | <kbd>Alt</kbd> <kbd>(number key)</kbd> | Switch to tab `number`.  For example, <kbd>Alt</kbd> <kbd>2</kbd> switches to tab 2. |

  ### Configuring Termonad

  The following is an example Termonad configuration file. You should save this to
  `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs`. You can find more information on the available
  configuration options within the
  [`Termonad.Config`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/termonad/docs/Termonad-Config.html)
  module.

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

  module Main where

  import Termonad.App (defaultMain)
  import Termonad.Config
    ( FontConfig, FontSize(FontSizePoints), Option(Set)
    , ShowScrollbar(ShowScrollbarAlways), defaultConfigOptions, defaultFontConfig
    , defaultTMConfig, fontConfig, fontFamily, fontSize, options, showScrollbar
    )
  import Termonad.Config.Colour
    ( AlphaColour, ColourConfig, addColourExtension, createColour
    , createColourExtension, cursorBgColour, defaultColourConfig
    )

  -- | This sets the color of the cursor in the terminal.
  --
  -- This uses the "Data.Colour" module to define a dark-red color.
  -- There are many default colors defined in "Data.Colour.Names".
  cursBgColour :: AlphaColour Double
  cursBgColour = createColour 204 0 0

  -- | This sets the colors used for the terminal.  We only specify the background
  -- color of the cursor.
  colConf :: ColourConfig (AlphaColour Double)
  colConf =
    defaultColourConfig
      { cursorBgColour = Set cursBgColour
      }

  -- | This defines the font for the terminal.
  fontConf :: FontConfig
  fontConf =
    defaultFontConfig
      { fontFamily = "DejaVu Sans Mono"
      , fontSize = FontSizePoints 13
      }

  main :: IO ()
  main = do
    colExt <- createColourExtension colConf
    let termonadConf =
          defaultTMConfig
            { options =
                defaultConfigOptions
                  { fontConfig = fontConf
                    -- Make sure the scrollbar is always visible.
                  , showScrollbar = ShowScrollbarAlways
                  }
            }
          `addColourExtension` colExt
    defaultMain termonadConf
  ```

  There are other example configuration files in the
  [example-config/](./example-config) directory.

  ### Compiling Local Settings

  If you launch Termonad by calling `~/.local/bin/termonad`, it will try to
  compile the `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs` file if it exists.  The problem is
  that `~/.local/bin/termonad` needs to be able to see GHC and the required
  Haskell libraries to be able to compile `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs`.

  There are a couple solutions to this problem, listed in the sections below.

  (These steps are definitely confusing. I would love to figure out a better
  way to do this.  Please submit an issue or PR if you have a good idea about
  how to fix this.)

  #### Running with `stack`

  If you originally compiled Termonad with `stack`, you can use `stack` to
  execute Termonad.  First, you must change to the directory with the Termonad
  source code.  From there, you can run `stack exec`:

  ```sh
  $ cd termonad/  # change to the termonad source code directory
  $ stack exec -- termonad
  ```

  `stack` will pick up the correct GHC version and libraries from the
  `stack.yaml` and `termonad.cabal` file.  `termonad` will be run in an
  environment with GHC available.  `termonad` will use this GHC and libraries to
  compile your `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs` file.  It if succeeds, it should
  create a `~/.cache/termonad/termonad-linux-x86_64` binary.

  If you need extra Haskell libraries available when compiling your
  `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs` file, you can specify them to `stack exec`:

  ```sh
  $ stack exec --package lens --package conduit -- termonad
  ```

  The problem with this is that `stack exec` changes quite a few of your
  environment variables.  It is not recommended to actually run Termonad from
  within `stack exec`.  After you run `stack exec -- termonad` and let it
  recompile your `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs` file, exit Termonad.
  Re-run Termonad by calling it directly.  Termonad will notice that
  `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs` hasn't changed since
  `~/.cache/termonad/termonad-linux-x86_64` has been recompiled, so it will
  directly execute `~/.cache/termonad/termonad-linux-x86_64`.

  #### Running with `nix`

  Building Termonad with `nix` (by running `nix-build` in the top
  directory) sets it up so that Termonad can see GHC.  Termonad should be able
  to compile the `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs` file by default.

  If you're interested in how this works, or want to change which Haskell
  packages are available from your `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs` file, please
  see the documentation in the
  [`.nix-helpers/termonad-with-packages.nix`](./.nix-helpers/termonad-with-packages.nix)
  file.

  ## Goals

  Termonad has the following goals:

  * fully configurable in Haskell

    There are already
    [many](https://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html)
    [good](https://www.enlightenment.org/about-terminology.md)
    [terminal](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html)
    [emulators](https://launchpad.net/sakura).  However, there are no terminal
    emulators fully configurable in Haskell.  Termonad fills this niche.

  * flexible

    Most people only need a terminal emulator that lets you change the font-size,
    cursor color, etc.  They don't need tons of configuration options.  Termonad
    should be for people that like lots of configuration options.  Termonad
    should provide many hooks to allow the user full control over its behavior.

  * stable

    Termonad should be able to be used everyday as your main terminal
    emulator.  It should not crash for any reason.  If you experience a crash,
    please file an issue or a pull request!

  * good documentation

    The [documentation](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/termonad) for
    Termonad on Hackage should be good.  You shouldn't have to guess at what
    certain data types or functions do.  If you have a hard time understanding
    anything in the documentation, please submit an issue or PR.

  ## Where to get help

  If you find a bug in Termonad, please either
  [send a PR](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pulls) fixing it or create
  an [issue](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/issues) explaining it.

  If you just need help with configuring Termonad, you can either join the
  [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/termonad/Lobby) or
  [#termonad on irc.freenode.net](https://webchat.freenode.net/).

  ## Contributions

  Contributions are highly appreciated.  Termonad is currently missing many
  helpful configuration options and behavior hooks.  If there is something you
  would like to add, please submit an issue or PR.
