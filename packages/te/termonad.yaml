changelog: |
  ## 4.2.0.0

  *   Add new options `highlightFgColour` and `highlightBgColour` for setting
      the color of highlighted text
      [#190](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/190).
      Thanks [@zanculmarktum](https://github.com/zanculmarktum)!

  *   Termonad creates a configuration file in `~/.config/termonad/termonad.yaml`
      for use with the Preferences editor.  This is only used if you don't
      have a `termonad.hs` file.

      The configuration file loading code has been updated to be more robust in
      loading configurations that are missing fields.  This means that if you
      update Termonad from an old version, your preferences will still be able to
      be loaded in most cases
      [#191](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/191).  Thanks again
      [@jecaro](https://github.com/jecaro)!

  *   Added an
      [example](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/blob/74d04ba1469184cd8667f88d24dfbc7d50d7f658/example-config/ExamplePaperColourColourExtension.hs)
      of how to setup a PaperColour color scheme. Thanks @craigem!
      [#193](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/193)

  ## 4.1.1.0

  *   Add new shortcuts to switch to the next and previous tab:
      <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>PgDown</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>PgUp</kbd>.
      This works similar to gnome-terminal and xfce4-terminal.
      [#180](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/180).
      Thanks [@juliendehos](https://github.com/juliendehos)!

  ## 4.1.0.0

  *   Add an option for enabling "bold is bright".  This forces colors from the
      extended light palette to be used whenever Termonad prints bold text.
      [#178](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/178).
      Thanks [@M0M097](https://github.com/M0M097)!

  ## 4.0.1.2

  *   Disable doctest test-suite when building with GHC-8.10.3.  The doctests
      appear to be segfaulting, but only when compiled with GHC-8.10.3.
      [#175](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/175).

  ## 4.0.1.1

  *   Bump upper dependency on `base` so that Termonad is compatible with
      GHC-8.10. [#172](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/172).
      Thanks [@mimi1vx](https://github.com/mimi1vx)!

  ## 4.0.1.0

  *   Add Preferences link to context menu.  This is a convenient way to open the
      Preferences if you don't have the menu shown by default.
      [#171](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/171) Thanks
      [@maridonkers](https://github.com/maridonkers)!

  ## 4.0.0.1

  *   Update Termonad to be able to be built with the latest versions of the
      haskell-gi libraries.  This shouldn't affect most users building with
      `stack`. It is only used
      [currently](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/95434) for building
      Termonad with packages from Nixpkgs.

  ## 4.0.0.0

  *   Remove the dependently typed code for specifying terminal colors.
      [#161](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/161).
      Thanks [@ssbothwell](https://github.com/ssbothwell)!

      The `Palette` data type has been updated to not used length-indexed lists,
      but instead just newtype wrappers around normal lists.

      In prevous versions, the `Palette` data type looked like this:

      ```haskell
      data Palette c
        = NoPalette
        | BasicPalette !(Vec N8 c)
        | ExtendedPalette !(Vec N8 c) !(Vec N8 c)
        | ColourCubePalette !(Vec N8 c) !(Vec N8 c) !(Matrix '[N6, N6, N6] c)
        | FullPalette !(Vec N8 c) !(Vec N8 c) !(Matrix '[N6, N6, N6] c) !(Vec N24 c)
      ```

      In 4.0.0.0, `Palette` has been changed to the following:

      ```haskell
      data Palette c
        = NoPalette
        | BasicPalette !(List8 c)
        | ExtendedPalette !(List8 c) !(List8 c)
        | ColourCubePalette !(List8 c) !(List8 c) !(Matrix c)
        | FullPalette !(List8 c) !(List8 c) !(Matrix c) !(List24 c)
      ```

      Instead of using types like `Vec N8 c`, you will use types like `List8 c`.

      When setting the `palette` field of in a `ColourConfig`, you can now do
      it like the following.  Note that there is both a `mkList8` function that
      returns `Maybe`, and an `unsafeMkList8` that throws a runtime error.
      Most users will probably want to use the `unsafeMkList8` function, since
      it is easy to use, and you can eyeball whether the list has the correct
      number of elements.  If you're doing something more complicated, you may
      want to use the `mkList8` function:

      ```haskell
      myColourConfig :: ColourConfig (AlphaColour Double)
      myColourConfig =
        defaultColourConfig
          { palette =
              ExtendedPalette
                myStandardColours (maybe defaultLightColours id myLightColours)
          }
        where
          -- This is a an example of creating a linked-list of colours,
          -- This function uses an unsafe method for generating the list.
          -- An exception will be thrown if your list does not have exactly 8 elements.
          myStandardColours :: List8 (AlphaColour Double)
          myStandardColours = unsafeMkList8
            [ createColour  40  30  20 -- dark brown (used as background colour)
            , createColour 180  30  20 -- red
            , createColour  40 160  20 -- green
            , createColour 180 160  20 -- dark yellow
            , createColour  40  30 120 -- dark purple
            , createColour 180  30 120 -- bright pink
            , createColour  40 160 120 -- teal
            , createColour 180 160 120 -- light brown
            ]

          -- This is an example of creating a linked-list of colours with a type
          -- safe method. mkList8 produces a Maybe value which must be handled explicitely.
          myLightColours :: Maybe (List8 (AlphaColour Double))
          myLightColours = mkList8
              [ createColour  70  60  50 -- brown
              , createColour 220  30  20 -- light red
              , createColour  40 210  20 -- light green
              , createColour 220 200  20 -- yellow
              , createColour  40  30 180 -- purple
              , createColour 140  30 80  -- dark pink
              , createColour  50 200 160 -- light teal
              , createColour 220 200 150 -- light brown
              ]
      ```

      Also see the functions `setAtList8`, `overAtList8`, `setAtList24`,
      `overAtList24`, etc.

  ## 3.1.0.1

  *   Correct the solarized colours
      [#148](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/148).
      Thanks [@craigem](https://github.com/craigem)!

  *   Add an example showing Gruvbox colours
      [#149](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/149).
      Thanks again [@craigem](https://github.com/craigem)!

  *   Set an upperbound on `base` so we make sure that only GHC-8.8 is used.  Some
      of the dependencies of Termonad don't support GHC-8.10 yet.

  ## 3.1.0.0

  *   Fix up deprecated functions used in Setup.hs.  This should allow Termonad to
      be compiled with Cabal-3.0.0.0 (which is used by default in GHC-8.8).
      [#144](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/144) Thanks
      [mdorman](https://github.com/mdorman)!

  *   Fully update to LTS-15 and GHC-8.8.  Termonad now requires GHC-8.8 in order
      to be compiled. [#145](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/145).

  ## 3.0.0.0

  *   Remove the one-pixel white border around the `GtkNotebook` (the GTK widget thing
      that contains the tabs). [#138](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/138)

  *   Add a right-click menu for the terminal.  It currently allows copy and
      paste.  [#136](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/136)  Thanks
      @jecaro!

  *   Add a preferences file that settings will be saved to and read from at
      `~/.config/termonad/termonad.yaml`.  You can change settings with the
      Preferences dialog.  **The settings will only be used from this file if you
      do not have a `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs` file**.
      [#140](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/140) Thanks again
      @jecaro!

  ## 2.1.0.0

  *   Add a menu option to set preferences for a running Termonad session.
      The preferences you have set are lost when you end the Termonad session.
      [#130](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/130)  Thanks @jecaro!

  ## 2.0.0.0

  *   Added menu option to search for a regex within the terminal output.
      This removes support for versions of VTE-2.91 older than 0.46.
      This means that compiling on older versions of Debian and Ubuntu may no
      longer work. [#118](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/118)

  ## 1.3.0.0

  *   Change all uses of
      [`Colour`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/colour-2.3.5/docs/Data-Colour.html#t:Colour)
      to
      [`AlphaColour`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/colour-2.3.5/docs/Data-Colour.html#t:AlphaColour)
      in `Termonad.Config.Colour`.  Users should now use `AlphaColour` instead of
      `Colour`.  Also, all uses of `sRGB24` should be replaced with `createColour`.
      This change is mechanical and should not affect how Termonad works at all.
      Thanks to @jecaro and @amir! [#116](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/116)

  ## 1.2.0.0

  *   Got the code for setting the backgroud color of the terminal actually
      working.  Thanks @dakotaclemenceplaza.
      [#111](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/111)
      *   This changes the type of `ColourConfig` to make the foreground and
          background colors of the terminal optional.

  *   Various cleanup in the nix files.

  ## 1.1.0.0

  *   Added an
      [example](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/blob/0cd741d51958806092418b55abdf1c1dc078841c/example-config/ExampleSolarizedColourExtension.hs)
      of how to setup a solarized color scheme. Thanks @craigem.
      [#90](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/90) and [#103](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/103)

  *   Various fixes in the nix files.  Make sure Termonad can see the GTK icons.
      [#91](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/91) and
      [#92](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/92)

  *   Add a menu option to change the font size at runtime.  You should be able to
      do this with the `Ctrl-+` and `Ctrl--` keys.
      [#95](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/95)

  *   Get building with GHC 8.6. Thanks @clinty.
      [#98](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/98)

  ## 1.0.1.0

  *   Stop using the `widgetSetFocusOnClick` function, which is not supported on
      older versions of GTK. This lets Termonad be compiled with older versions
      of GTK. [#87](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/87).

  *   Add CI. [#87](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/87).

  *   Support versions of VTE-2.91 older than 0.44.
      [#87](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/87).

  *   Add some functions for converting from a list to a `Vec` in
      `Termonad.Config.Vec`: `fromListVec` and `fromListVec_`.  Commit 883eb98b5f.

  *   Fix the paste hotkey. [#86](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pull/86).

  ## 1.0.0.0

  *   The API for configuring Termonad is now completely different. Many, many
      changes have gone into this version.  You should approach it as a
      completely different application.

      The CHANGELOG will be kept up-to-date for future releases.

  ## 0.2.1.0

  *   Make sure the window title is set to "Termonad".

  *   Relabel tabs when termonad is started.

  ## 0.2.0.0

  *   Open dialog asking if you want to quit when you try to use your WM to quit.

  *   Termonad will attempt to open up a new terminal in the working directory of
      the current terminal.

  *   Make sure termonad won't crash if dyre can't find GHC.

  *   Add a few more ways to compile on NixOS.

  *   Add an icon for termonad.

  ## 0.1.0.0

  *   Initial release.

  Termonad is a terminal emulator configurable in Haskell.  It is extremely
  customizable and provides hooks to modify the default behavior.  It can be
  thought of as the "XMonad" of terminal emulators.

  Termonad was
  [featured on an episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLNr_gBv5HY) of
  [DistroTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVls1GmFKf6WlTraIb_IaJg).
  This video gives a short overview of Termonad.

  ## Installation

  Termonad can be installed on any system as long as the necessary GTK libraries
  are available.  The following are instructions for installing Termonad on a few
  different distributions and systems.  If the given steps don't work for you, or
  you want to add instructions for an additional system, please send a pull
  request.

  The following steps use the
  [`stack`](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) build tool to build
  Termonad, but [`cabal`](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) can be used as well. Steps for
  installing `stack` can be found on
  [this page](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/).


  ### Arch Linux

  First, you must install the required GTK system libraries:

  ```sh
  $ pacman -S vte3 gobject-introspection
  ```

  In order to install Termonad, clone this repository and run `stack install`.
  This will install the `termonad` binary to `~/.local/bin/`:

  ```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad
  $ cd termonad/
  $ stack install
  ```

  ### Ubuntu / Debian

  First, you must install the required GTK system libraries:

  ```sh
  $ apt-get install gobject-introspection libgirepository1.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libvte-2.91-dev libpcre2-dev
  ```

  In order to install Termonad, clone this repository and run `stack install`.
  This will install the `termonad` binary to `~/.local/bin/`:

  ```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad
  $ cd termonad/
  $ stack install
  ```

  ### Nix

  If you have `nix` installed, you should be able to use it to build Termonad.
  This means that it will work on NixOS, or with `nix` on another distro.  There
  are two different ways to use `nix` to build Termonad:

  The first is using `stack`.  The following commands install `stack` for your
  user, clone this repository, and install the `termonad` binary to `~/.local/bin/`:

  ```sh
  $ nix-env -i stack
  $ git clone https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad
  $ cd termonad/
  $ stack --nix install
  ```

  (_edit_: Building with `stack` using Nix-integration does not currently work.
  See [#99](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/issues/99).)

  The second is using the normal `nix-build` machinery.  The following commands
  clone this repository and build the `termonad` binary at `./result/bin/`:

  ```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad
  $ cd termonad/
  $ nix-build
  ```

  ### Mac OS X

  Building and installing Termonad on Mac OS X should be possible with any of the following three methods:

  -   Install the required system libraries (like GTK and VTE) by hand, then use
      `stack` to build Termonad.

      This is probably the easiest method.  You don't have to understand anything
      about `nix`.  However, it is slightly annoying to have to install GTK and
      VTE by hand.

  -   Use `nix` to install both the required system libraries and Termonad itself.

      If you are a nix user and want an easy way to install Termonad, this
      is the recommended method.

  -   Use `nix` to install install the required system libraries, and `stack` to
      build Termonad.

      If you are a nix user, but want to use `stack` to actually do development
      on Termonad, using `stack` may be easier than using `cabal`.

  The following sections describe each method.

  #### Installing with just `stack`

  (*currently no instructions available.  please send a PR adding instructions if you get termonad to build using this method.*)

  #### Installing with just `nix`

  `nix` can be used to install Termonad with the following steps, assuming you
  have `nix` [installed](https://nixos.org/nix/download.html).  These commands
  clone this repository and build the `termonad` binary at `./result/bin/`:

  ```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad
  $ cd termonad/
  $ nix-build
  ```

  #### Installing with `stack` using `nix`

  `stack` can be used in conjunction with `nix` to install Termonad.  `nix` will
  handle installing system dependencies (like GTK and VTE), while `stack` will
  handle compiling and installing Haskell packages.

  You must have `nix` [installed](https://nixos.org/nix/download.html).

  You will also need `stack` installed.  You can do that with the following command:

  ```sh
  $ nix-env -i stack
  ```

  After `stack` is installed, you will need to clone Termonad and build it:

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad
  $ cd termonad/
  $ stack --nix install
  ```

  This will install the `termonad` binary to `~/.local/bin/`.

  ### Windows

  To run Termonad on Windows, you'll need:

  * any X server app, for example **Vcxsrv**
  * any WSL, for example **Ubuntu**

  I'm using both Vcxsrv and Ubuntu WSL.

  Configure both Vcxsrv and WSL. For Vcxsrv go with default settings
  everywhere, it will be fine. Configure your WSL as you want (choose
  your name etc.). After you set up the user, you'll have to update your
  OS, run:

  ```console
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get upgrade -y
  $ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y
  $ sudo apt-get autoremove -y
  ```

  Configure the `DISPLAY` environment variable for the X server, and load the changes in bash:

  For WSL1:

  ```console
  $ echo "export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0" >> ~/.bashrc
  $ source ~/.bashrc
  ```

  For WSL2:

  ```console
  $ echo export DISPLAY=$(awk '/nameserver / {print $2; exit}' /etc/resolv.conf 2>/dev/null):0 >> ~/.bashrc
  $ echo export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1 >> ~/.bashrc
  $ source ~/.bashrc
  ```

  If you're using WSL2, you have to create a separate **inbound rule** for TCP port 6000, to allow WSL access to the X server.
  If you're using mentioned earlier **Vcxsrv** you can enable public access for your X server by disabling Access Control on the Extra Settings.
  You can also use `-ac` flag in the Additional parameters for VcXsrv section.

  Your X server should now be configured.

  Execute following command to install the necessary GTK system libraries:

  ```console
  $ apt-get install gobject-introspection libgirepository1.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libvte-2.91-dev libpcre2-dev
  ```

  The required GTK system libraries should now be installed.

  Clone the Termonad repo:

  ```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad
  $ cd termonad/
  $ stack build
  $ stack run
  ```
  After `stack run`, you should see a new window with your Termonad running.

  ## How to use Termonad

  Termonad is similar to XMonad. The above steps will install a `termonad` binary
  somewhere on your system. If you have installed Termonad using `stack`, the
  `termonad` binary will be in `~/.local/bin/`. This binary is a version of
  Termonad configured with default settings. You can try running it to get an idea
  of what Termonad is like:

  ```sh
  $ ~/.local/bin/termonad
  ```

  The following section describes the default key bindings.

  If you would like to configure Termonad with your own settings, first you will
  need to create a Haskell file called `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs`. A following
  section gives an example configuration file.

  If this configuration file exists, when the `~/.local/bin/termonad` binary
  launches, it will try to use GHC to compile the configuration file. If GHC
  is able to successfully compile the configuration file, a separate binary will
  be created called something like `~/.cache/termonad/termonad-linux-x86_64`.
  This binary file can be thought of as your own personal Termonad, configured
  with all your own settings.

  When you run `~/.local/bin/termonad`, it will re-exec
  `~/.cache/termonad/termonad-linux-x86_64` if it exists.

  However, there is one difficulty with this setup. In order for the
  `~/.local/bin/termonad` binary to be able to compile your
  `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs` configuration file, Termonad needs to know
  where GHC is, as well as where all your Haskell packages live. This presents
  some difficulties that will be discussed in a following section.

  ### Default Key Bindings

  Termonad provides the following default key bindings.

  | Key binding | Action |
  |------------|--------|
  | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>t</kbd> | Open new tab. |
  | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>w</kbd> | Close tab. |
  | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>f</kbd> | Open Find dialog for searching for a regex. |
  | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>p</kbd> | Find the regex **above** the current position. |
  | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>i</kbd> | Find the regex **below** the current position. |
  | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>+</kbd> | Increase font size. |
  | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>-</kbd> | Decrease font size. |
  | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>PgUp</kbd> | Switch to previous tab. |
  | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>PgDown</kbd> | Switch to next tab. |
  | <kbd>Alt</kbd> <kbd>(number key)</kbd> | Switch to tab `number`.  For example, <kbd>Alt</kbd> <kbd>2</kbd> switches to tab 2. |

  ### Configuring Termonad

  Termonad has two different ways to be configured.

  The first way is to use the built-in Preferences editor.  You can find this in
  the `Preferences` menu under `Edit` in the menubar.

  When opening Termonad for the first time, it will create a preferences file at
  `~/.config/termonad/termonad.yaml`.  When you change a setting in the
  Preferences editor, Termonad will update the setting in the preferences file.

  When running Termonad, it will load settings from the preferences file.
  Do not edit the preferences file by hand, because it will be overwritten when
  updating settings in the Preferences editor.

  This method is perfect for users who only want to make small changes to the
  Termonad settings, like the default font size.

  The second way to configure Termonad is to use a Haskell-based settings file,
  called `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs` by default.  This method allows you to
  make large, sweeping changes to Termonad.  This method is recommended for power
  users.

  **WARNING: If you have a `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs` file, then all
  settings from `~/.config/termonad/termonad.yaml` will be ignored.  If you want
  to set *ANY* settings in `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs`, then you must
  set *ALL* settings in `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs`.**

  The following is an example Termonad configuration file. You should save this to
  `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs`. You can find more information on the available
  configuration options within the
  [`Termonad.Config`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/termonad/docs/Termonad-Config.html)
  module.

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

  module Main where

  import Termonad.App (defaultMain)
  import Termonad.Config
    ( FontConfig, FontSize(FontSizePoints), Option(Set)
    , ShowScrollbar(ShowScrollbarAlways), defaultConfigOptions, defaultFontConfig
    , defaultTMConfig, fontConfig, fontFamily, fontSize, options, showScrollbar
    )
  import Termonad.Config.Colour
    ( AlphaColour, ColourConfig, addColourExtension, createColour
    , createColourExtension, cursorBgColour, defaultColourConfig
    )

  -- | This sets the color of the cursor in the terminal.
  --
  -- This uses the "Data.Colour" module to define a dark-red color.
  -- There are many default colors defined in "Data.Colour.Names".
  cursBgColour :: AlphaColour Double
  cursBgColour = createColour 204 0 0

  -- | This sets the colors used for the terminal.  We only specify the background
  -- color of the cursor.
  colConf :: ColourConfig (AlphaColour Double)
  colConf =
    defaultColourConfig
      { cursorBgColour = Set cursBgColour
      }

  -- | This defines the font for the terminal.
  fontConf :: FontConfig
  fontConf =
    defaultFontConfig
      { fontFamily = "DejaVu Sans Mono"
      , fontSize = FontSizePoints 13
      }

  main :: IO ()
  main = do
    colExt <- createColourExtension colConf
    let termonadConf =
          defaultTMConfig
            { options =
                defaultConfigOptions
                  { fontConfig = fontConf
                    -- Make sure the scrollbar is always visible.
                  , showScrollbar = ShowScrollbarAlways
                  }
            }
          `addColourExtension` colExt
    defaultMain termonadConf
  ```

  There are other example configuration files in the
  [example-config/](./example-config) directory.

  If you want to test what all the colors look like, you may find it convenient
  to use the
  [`print-console-colors`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/print-console-colors)
  package, which provides an executable called `print-console-colors` that prints
  all of the colors for your terminal.

  ### Compiling Local Settings

  If you launch Termonad by calling `~/.local/bin/termonad`, it will try to
  compile the `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs` file if it exists.  The problem is
  that `~/.local/bin/termonad` needs to be able to see GHC and the required
  Haskell libraries to be able to compile `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs`.

  There are a couple solutions to this problem, listed in the sections below.

  (These steps are definitely confusing. I would love to figure out a better
  way to do this.  Please submit an issue or PR if you have a good idea about
  how to fix this.)

  #### Running with `stack`

  If you originally compiled Termonad with `stack`, you can use `stack` to
  execute Termonad.  First, you must change to the directory with the Termonad
  source code.  From there, you can run `stack exec`:

  ```sh
  $ cd termonad/  # change to the termonad source code directory
  $ stack exec -- termonad
  ```

  `stack` will pick up the correct GHC version and libraries from the
  `stack.yaml` and `termonad.cabal` file.  `termonad` will be run in an
  environment with GHC available.  `termonad` will use this GHC and libraries to
  compile your `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs` file.  It if succeeds, it should
  create a `~/.cache/termonad/termonad-linux-x86_64` binary.

  If you need extra Haskell libraries available when compiling your
  `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs` file, you can specify them to `stack exec`:

  ```sh
  $ stack exec --package lens --package conduit -- termonad
  ```

  The problem with this is that `stack exec` changes quite a few of your
  environment variables.  It is not recommended to actually run Termonad from
  within `stack exec`.  After you run `stack exec -- termonad` and let it
  recompile your `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs` file, exit Termonad.
  Re-run Termonad by calling it directly.  Termonad will notice that
  `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs` hasn't changed since
  `~/.cache/termonad/termonad-linux-x86_64` has been recompiled, so it will
  directly execute `~/.cache/termonad/termonad-linux-x86_64`.

  #### Running with `nix`

  Building Termonad with `nix` (by running `nix-build` in the top
  directory) sets it up so that Termonad can see GHC.  Termonad should be able
  to compile the `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs` file by default.

  If you're interested in how this works, or want to change which Haskell
  packages are available from your `~/.config/termonad/termonad.hs` file, please
  see the documentation in the
  [`.nix-helpers/termonad-with-packages.nix`](./.nix-helpers/termonad-with-packages.nix)
  file.

  ## Goals

  Termonad has the following goals:

  * fully configurable in Haskell

    There are already
    [many](https://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html)
    [good](https://www.enlightenment.org/about-terminology.md)
    [terminal](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html)
    [emulators](https://launchpad.net/sakura).  However, there are no terminal
    emulators fully configurable in Haskell.  Termonad fills this niche.

  * flexible

    Most people only need a terminal emulator that lets you change the font-size,
    cursor color, etc.  They don't need tons of configuration options.  Termonad
    should be for people that like lots of configuration options.  Termonad
    should provide many hooks to allow the user full control over its behavior.

  * stable

    Termonad should be able to be used everyday as your main terminal
    emulator.  It should not crash for any reason.  If you experience a crash,
    please file an issue or a pull request!

  * good documentation

    The [documentation](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/termonad) for
    Termonad on Hackage should be good.  You shouldn't have to guess at what
    certain data types or functions do.  If you have a hard time understanding
    anything in the documentation, please submit an issue or PR.

  ## Where to get help

  If you find a bug in Termonad, please either
  [send a PR](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/pulls) fixing it or create
  an [issue](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad/issues) explaining it.

  If you just need help with configuring Termonad, you can either join the
  [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/termonad/Lobby) or
  [#termonad on irc.freenode.net](https://webchat.freenode.net/).

  ## Contributions

  Contributions are highly appreciated.  Termonad is currently missing many
  helpful configuration options and behavior hooks.  If there is something you
  would like to add, please submit an issue or PR.
