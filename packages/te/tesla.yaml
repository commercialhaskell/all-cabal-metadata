  # Changelog for tesla

  # Release 0.7.0.0

  Authentication is no longer supported.

  It hasn't worked for about a year now and Tesla aggressively thwarts automation.

  # Release 0.6.0.0

  All APIs that send data use JSON now.

  Previously we sent form/data and that was fine, but apparently no longer is.

  # Release 0.5.0.0

  Added:

  1. maxDefrost
  2. bioweapon defense mode controls
  3. setAmps
  4. scheduled charging configuration
  5. scheduled departure configuration

  Also added a prism for viewing `VehicleData` as an Aeson `Value`.

  # Release 0.3.1.0

  Authentication is supported again (though not yet MFA path).

  More access to more APIs where available.

  # Release 0.1.0.1

  A more informative exception is thrown from `runNamedCar` when an
  unknown car name is given.

  Tesla API for Haskell.

  ## Authentication

  This library used to support authenticating via username and password to get credentials, but Tesla busted that pretty hard.

  The best practice at this point is to use something like https://www.teslafi.com/tokenUser.php to get a bearer and refresh token and feed them to the library via `fromToken` and `refreshAuth`
