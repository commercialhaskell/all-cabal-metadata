synopsis: Calculate various string metrics efficiently
changelog: |
  ## Text Metrics 0.3.1

  * Fixed a bug in the implementation of Jaro-Winkler distance when two
    strings share a long prefix. [PR
    21](https://github.com/mrkkrp/text-metrics/pull/21).

  * Dropped support for GHC 8.6 and older.

  ## Text Metrics 0.3.0

  * All functions are now implemented in pure Haskell.

  * All functions return `Int` or `Ratio Int` instead of `Natural` and `Ratio
    Natural`.

  * Added `overlap` (returns overlap coefficient) and `jaccard` (returns
    Jaccard similarity coefficient).

  ## Text Metrics 0.2.0

  * Made the `levenshtein`, `levenshteinNorm`, `damerauLevenshtein`, and
    `demerauLevenshtein` more efficient.

  * Added `jaro` and `jaroWinkler` functions.

  ## Text Metrics 0.1.0

  * Initial release.

  ![CI](https://github.com/mrkkrp/text-metrics/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

  The library provides efficient implementations of various strings metric
  algorithms. It works with strict `Text` values.

  The current version of the package implements:

  * [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance)
  * [Normalized Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance)
  * [Damerau-Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance)
  * [Normalized Damerau-Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance)
  * [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance)
  * [Jaro distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance)
  * [Jaro-Winkler distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance)
  * [Overlap coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlap_coefficient)
  * [Jaccard similarity coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index)

  ## Comparison with the `edit-distance` package

  There is
  [`edit-distance`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/edit-distance) package
  whose scope overlaps with the scope of this package. The differences are:

  * `edit-distance` allows to specify costs for every operation when
    calculating Levenshtein distance (insertion, deletion, substitution, and
    transposition). This is rarely needed though in real-world applications,
    IMO.

  * `edit-distance` only provides Levenshtein distance, `text-metrics` aims to
    provide implementations of most string metrics algorithms.

  * `edit-distance` works on `Strings`, while `text-metrics` works on strict
    `Text` values.

  ## Implementation

  Although we originally used C for speed, currently all functions are pure
  Haskell tuned for performance. See [this blog
  post](https://markkarpov.com/post/migrating-text-metrics.html) for more
  info.
