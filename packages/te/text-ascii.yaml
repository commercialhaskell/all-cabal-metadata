changelog: "# Revision history for text-ascii\n\n## 1.0.1 -- 2021-03-02\n\n* Support
  GHC 9.\n* Replace 8.10.3 with 8.10.4 in CI.\n* Expose `Text.Ascii.Internal` and
  `Text.Ascii.QQ`.\n* Add `Ixed` instance (and supporting type instances) for `AsciiText`.\n*
  Add `Stream`, `VisualStream` and `TraversableStream` instances (and supporting\n
  \ type instances) for `AsciiText`.\n* Drop Parsec in favour of Megaparsec.\n* Add
  `FoldCase` instances for `AsciiChar` and `AsciiText`.\n* Implement `lines`, `unlines`,
  `words`, `unwords`, `replicate`, `chunksOf`, \n  `index`, `zipWith`, `justifyLeft`,
  `justifyRight`, `center`, `takeEnd`, \n  `dropEnd`, `dropAround`, `strip`, `stripStart`,
  `stripEnd`, `commonPrefixes` \n  for `AsciiText`.\n* Implement [NSN](https://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~lecroq/string/node13.html),
  as \n  well as the following functions that use it:\n  * `count`\n  * `replace`\n
  \ * `splitOn`\n  * `stripInfix`\n  * `breakOnAll`\n  * `breakOn`\n  * `breakOnEnd`\n*
  Add `Unsafe` module containing an `Unsafe` wrapper, plus instances and\n  functions.\n*

description: "# `text-ascii`\n\n## What is this thing?\n\nA library for handling ASCII
  text.\n\n## What are the goals of this project?\n\n### Totality by default\n\nPartial
  functions (and type classes which provide them) will not be included:\neverything
  is total. When we include anything unsafe, it will be explicitly\nfirewalled into
  its own module, behind a newtype.\n\n### No boolean blindness\n\n[Boolean blindness](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/#boolean-blindness)
  is not\na good thing, for all the reasons listed in the link. Whenever possible,
  we'll\ntry and give more useful information than a `Bool`.\n\n### Compatibility
  with the [`text`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/text) API\n\nWe want match
  the API of the `text` package exactly. If you know how to use `text`, \nyou'll know
  how to use this package too. Exceptions are made for places where\n`text` is either
  partial or boolean-blind.\n\n### Discoverability, documentation and user-friendliness\n\nIn
  addition to documenting everything with Haddocks, we have over 250 doctests,\nwhich
  provide _executable_ examples of how the API can be used, and how it will\nbehave.
  We aim to clarify _every_ corner case left by the documentation of\n`text`, and
  care strongly about making the API easy to follow, learn and\nunderstand.\n\n###
  Correctness\n\nWe currently use doctests, but plan to add support for more testing.
  No such\nthing as too much!\n\n### Low dependencies\n\nAs far as possible, we aim
  to depend on [GHC boot packages](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/commentary/libraries/version-history)
  only. When we\nintroduce more dependencies, we do it only when we have to. This
  way, we ensure\nthis package builds quickly and doesn't 'lag' more than necessary
  due to GHC\nversion changes.\n\n## What's with all the cat stuff?\n\n[I am a Haskell
  catboy.](https://twitter.com/KozRoss)\n\n## What does this run on?\n\nCurrently,
  our CI checks the following versions of GHC:\n\n* 8.6.5\n* 8.8.4\n* 8.10.4\n* 9.0.1\n\nWe
  check on the following platforms:\n\n* Windows\n* Linux\n* MacOS\n\n## What can
  I do with this?\n\nThe project is licensed Apache 2.0 (SPDX code\n[`Apache-2.0`](https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html)).
