description: |-
  When tracking down a problem it can often be useful to temporarily disable
  some or many of the tests in a suite so that one can focus on the problematic
  tests.  Rather than using a mess of comments, this module provides a
  function 'skip' (and a few variants) that causses a test or an entire test
  suite to be skipped - specifically, they will still show up in the suite
  as being 'skipped', but they will not be run.
