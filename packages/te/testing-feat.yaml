description: ! 'Feat (Functional Enumeration of Algebraic Types) provides

  enumerations as functions from natural numbers to values

  (similar to @toEnum@ but for any algebraic data type). This

  can be used for SmallCheck-style systematic testing,

  QuickCheck style random testing, and hybrids of the two.


  The enumerators are defined in a very boilerplate manner

  and there is a Template Haskell script for deriving the

  class instance for most types.

  "Test.Feat" contain a subset of the other modules that

  should be sufficient for most test usage. There

  are some small and large example in the tar

  ball.


  The generators are provided by the size-based package. This means other libraries
  that implement the Sized class can use the same generator definitions. One such
  is the

  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lazy-search lazy-search package>, that uses
  laziness to search for values and test properties. This is typically a lot faster
  than Feat for properties that have preconditions (logical implication), but can
  not be used for random selection of values.'
