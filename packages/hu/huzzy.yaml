description: |-
  Library for creating fuzzy sets and systems.
  There are known issues with overly precise values in Type-2 sets.
  Incredibly alpha, please do not use this for controlling your shower.
  Huge thanks to Emilio Gallego for his work on ffuzz: http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~emilioga/software/ffuzz/.
  Heavily inspired by http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=44203
