  Hurdle - (H)askell (U)tilty (R)egarding (DL)l (E)xports.

  Extract function names from Windows DLLs a-la pexports.

  Hurdle has minimal dependencies: base, containers, and
  kangaroo (kangaroo just needs base and array).

  Currently Hurdle also has minimal utility - please consider
  pexports instead as Hurdle doesn't yet print ordinals and
  fails on DLLs generated by Visual C++ (which puts function
  symbols in the .rdata section - gcc uses the .edata section).

  Hurdle was a Sunday afternoon hack that has taken a good while
  longer...
