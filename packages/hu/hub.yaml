description: |-
  This package provides a utility for multiplexing
  multiple GHC and Haskell Platform installations,
  each selected by an environment variable or a work-tree
  configuration file.

  The package also provides flexible development sandboxes
  (aka /hubs/) into which packages can be installed
  and subsequently erased. Commands are provided for
  (re)naming, annotating, replicating, swapping, archiving,
  locking and removing hubs. E.g.,

  > hub init

  will create a hub based on the default GHC installation
  and associate the current directory with it. Any use
  of /cabal/ or the GHC tools within this directory or it's
  descendants will work with correct tool chain and the
  private user-package database belonging to the hub.

  The following would (i) download 'hexpat' (ii) install it
  in a named 'hexpat-test' hub connected to the /2011.2.0.1/
  Haskell Platform, (iii) build the 'hexpat' test suite
  with the same hub, and (iv) finally run the test suite.

  >cabal unpack hexpat
  >cd hexpat-*
  >hub init -s 2011.2.0.1 hexpat-test
  >cabal install
  >cd test
  >cabal install --bindir=.
  >./testsuite

  This same 'hexpat-test' hub can be shared with other
  work trees.

  The tool is intended to be provided as part of a
  distribution (like the /JustHub/ Enterprise Linux
  distribution) but it can be configured with existing
  stock GHC installations without too much effort.  Once
  installed and configured the hub command  inter-operates
  seamlessly with the GHC tools (/ghc/, /ghci/, /ghc-pkg/,
  etc.) and /Cabal-install/.
