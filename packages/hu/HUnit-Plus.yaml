description: |-
  HUnit-Plus is a testing framework for Haskell that builds on the
  HUnit test framework.  HUnit-Plus provides functions and operators
  for creating assertions and tests similar to those provided by the
  HUnit framework.  Unlike HUnit, HUnit-Plus uses the same data
  structures as cabal's "Distribution.TestSuite" framework, allowing
  full compatibility with cabal's testing facilities.

  HUnit-Plus also provides expanded reporting capabilities, including
  the ability to generate JUnit-style XML reports, along with a very
  flexible mechanism for selecting which tests to be executed.
  Lastly, HUnit-Plus provides a wrapper which generates standalone
  test-execution programs from a set of test suites.
