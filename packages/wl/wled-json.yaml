  # Changelog for `wled-json`

  Hopefully all notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

  The project adheres to the [Haskell Package Versioning Policy](https://pvp.haskell.org/).

  ## Unreleased

  - Awesome upcoming features!

  ## 0.1.0.1 - Keep compatibility with ghc 9.2/9.4 - 2025-10-26

  - Keep compatibility with ghc 9.2/9.4.

  ## 0.1.0.0 - Support differently designed lamps - 2025-05-29

  - Separate lamp specification from WLED interaction - so that own designs could be integrated.

  ## 0.0.1.1 - Small cosmetic improvements - 2025-03-28

  - Demonstration:
    - Added menu and option to change wled device URL via terminal or command line argument
    - Added tool to traverse every single LED (to be able to better detect positions)
  - Octolamp Support:
    - Added more flags with three vertical stripes

  ## 0.0.1.0 - Initial release - 2024-12-02

  - Core Functionality:
    - Basic connection to WLED devices
    - Setting color, brightness, etc.
  - Octolamp Support:
    - Initial support for Octolamp-specific features (provide the French flag)

description: "# wled-json ✨\n\nHaskell bindings for controlling WLED devices, with
  a focus on Octolamps\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alaendle/wled-json/main/images/octolamp.jpg\"
  alt=\"Octolamp showing french flag\" width=\"50%\"/>\n</p>\n\n## Introduction \U0001F4A1\n\nThis
  Haskell library provides a convenient interface for interacting with WLED devices,
  particularly those based on the popular Octolamp design. It leverages the WLED API
  (https://kno.wled.ge/) to allow you to control various aspects of your LED lights,
  including:\n\n- **Color:** Set the color of your lights using various color spaces
  (RGB, HSV, etc.)\n- **Brightness:** Adjust the overall brightness of your lights\n\n##
  Usage \U0001F4F2\n\n```haskell\nimport           Control.Concurrent (threadDelay)\nimport
  \          WLED.Device        (getLampState, setLampState)\nimport           WLED.Lamp.Octocat
  \ (octocatSpec)\nimport           WLED.Pattern.Flags (bulgaria)\nimport           WLED.Types
  \        (diff)\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n    -- Connect to a WLED device\n    lampState
  <- getLampState wledUrl\n    case lampState of\n        Left errMsg -> putStrLn
  errMsg\n        Right initialState -> do\n            -- Display the Bulgarian flag
  on an Octolamp\n            _ <- setLampState wledUrl (bulgaria octocatSpec)\n\n
  \           -- Just sleep five seconds\n            threadDelay 5000000\n\n            --
  Restore the initial state\n            Right currentState <- getLampState wledUrl\n
  \           _ <- setLampState wledUrl (diff currentState initialState)\n            pure
  ()\n  where\n    wledUrl = \"http://192.168.178.34\"\n```\n\n## Features \U0001F44D\n\n-
  Comprehensive WLED API coverage\n- Type-safe interactions\n- Easy-to-use API\n-
  Specific support for Octolamps\n- Reusable pattern for other lamp designs\n\n##
