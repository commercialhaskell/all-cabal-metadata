  Changes
  =======

  Version 0.4.0.0
  ---------------

  API breaking update.

  * New options for threading control (single-threaded, thread-per-watch, and thread-per-manager)
  * Revamp `WatchConfig` options to be less confusing and reduce boolean blindness.
  * Pull out debouncing stuff, since it was never correct as it simply took the last event affecting a given file in the debounce period. Debouncing is currently not included, and should be handled as an orthogonal concern. I'd like to include some debouncing logic, but didn't want to delay this release any longer.
    * We now expose `type DebounceFn = Action -> IO Action`, which represents an arbitrary debouncer. All debouncers should be in the form of one of these functions.
    * A robust state machine debouncer is in progress but not fully implemented yet; see the `state-machine` branch.
    * Contributions are welcome! We can potentially add multiple debouncers of different complexity as modules under `System.FSNotify.Debounce.*`.
  * Don't silently fall back to polling on failure of native watcher.
    Instead, throw an exception which the user can recover from by switching to polling.
  * Add ModifiedAttributes event type + Linux support
  * Add confOnHandlerException to be able to control what happens when a handler throws an exception.
  * WatchConfig constructor is no longer exposed. Instead use `defaultConfig {...}` with the accessors.

  Version 0.3.0.0
  ---------------

  API breaking update with a number of bugfixes and improvements.

  * Now we can detect directory creation/deletion. A boolean flag has been added
    to `Event` to indicate if the event pertains to a directory or not. This is the
    only API change.
  * Test stability improvements + CI test suites now passing on Windows, Linux, and Mac.
  * Interpreting OSX hfsevents flags is more sane now (see comments in OSX.hs for details).
  * Improve a race condition when adding watches on Linux.
  * Improve robustness of the PollManager.
  * Fix double call to `closeHandle` on Windows.
  * Remove comments about locking from the documentation.

  Version 0.2.1.2
  ---------------

  Update to the new hinotify API (v0.3.10)

  Version 0.2.1.1
  ---------------

  Catch IO exceptions when initialising inotify on Linux

  Version 0.2.1
  -------------

  Don't use `system-filepath`

  Version 0.2
  -----------

  Use filepath instead of deprecated system-filepath

  Version 0.1.0.3
  ---------------

  * Fix the tests

  Version 0.1.0.2
  ---------------

  * Restore compatibility with GHC 7.4
  * Fix a bug in `treeExtAny`, which previously work identically to
    `treeExtExists`
  * Improve documentation

  Version 0.1.0.1
  ---------------

  Include CHANGELOG.md and README.md in the source distribution.

  Version 0.1
  -----------

  * Allow to stop a listening job. Note this changes the return type of watching
    functions from `()` to `IO ()`.
  * Previously, some care was taken to prevent multiple callbacks from running
    simultaneously. It is now the user's responsibility. See
    [#43](https://github.com/haskell-fswatch/hfsnotify/issues/43) for details.
  * Previously, paths returned to callbacks were relative on Windows. Now they are
    absolute, like on the other platforms.
  * The `WatchConfig` type has changed. Previously, it only specified debouncing
    parameters. Now it also contains polling parameters.
  * The `isPollingManager` function is added to determine, at runtime, whether the
    polling implementation is used.
