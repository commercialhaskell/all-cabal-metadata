  Changes
  =======

  Version 0.3.0.0
  ---------------

  API breaking update with a number of bugfixes and improvements.

  * Now we can detect directory creation/deletion. A boolean flag has been added
    to `Event` to indicate if the event pertains to a directory or not. This is the
    only API change.
  * Test stability improvements + CI test suites now passing on Windows, Linux, and Mac.
  * Interpreting OSX hfsevents flags is more sane now (see comments in OSX.hs for details).
  * Improve a race condition when adding watches on Linux.
  * Improve robustness of the PollManager.
  * Fix double call to `closeHandle` on Windows.
  * Remove comments about locking from the documentation.

  Version 0.2.1.2
  ---------------

  Update to the new hinotify API (v0.3.10)

  Version 0.2.1.1
  ---------------

  Catch IO exceptions when initialising inotify on Linux

  Version 0.2.1
  -------------

  Don't use `system-filepath`

  Version 0.2
  -----------

  Use filepath instead of deprecated system-filepath

  Version 0.1.0.3
  ---------------

  * Fix the tests

  Version 0.1.0.2
  ---------------

  * Restore compatibility with GHC 7.4
  * Fix a bug in `treeExtAny`, which previously work identically to
    `treeExtExists`
  * Improve documentation

  Version 0.1.0.1
  ---------------

  Include CHANGELOG.md and README.md in the source distribution.

  Version 0.1
  -----------

  * Allow to stop a listening job. Note this changes the return type of watching
    functions from `()` to `IO ()`.
  * Previously, some care was taken to prevent multiple callbacks from running
    simultaneously. It is now the user's responsibility. See
    [#43](https://github.com/haskell-fswatch/hfsnotify/issues/43) for details.
  * Previously, paths returned to callbacks were relative on Windows. Now they are
    absolute, like on the other platforms.
  * The `WatchConfig` type has changed. Previously, it only specified debouncing
    parameters. Now it also contains polling parameters.
  * The `isPollingManager` function is added to determine, at runtime, whether the
    polling implementation is used.
