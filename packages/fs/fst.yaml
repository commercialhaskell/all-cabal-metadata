description: |-
  Fst is an application for construction and running of finite state
  transducers, as based on the concepts of transducers and regular
  relations developed by Xerox.  The syntax of Xerox's fst program has
  functioned as an inspiration for the syntax of fstStudio.

  The application was written purely in Haskell, and is intended to be
  a tool for the Haskell programmer, especially for ones that develop
  language applications.

  This package provides an interactive shell for parsing transducers
  specified in a specialized FST language. See "FST.FSTStudio".

  This package also provides a programmer's interface for building and
  applying transducers. See "FST.TransducerInterface".
