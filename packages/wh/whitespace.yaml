  # Whitespace #

  See [the original web site](http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/whitespace/) for full
  documentation of the base language.

  # Local Changes #

  ## Cabal support ##

  You can use the "cabal install" command to build and install the wspace
  executable.

  ## Shuffling in Whitespace ##

  Until now, programmers interested in using randomized algorithms in Whitespace
  have been required to supply some random stuff as input to their program. To
  solve this, I propose adding a new instruction to the Whitespace language that
  will shuffle the stack. This feature can then be used to implement various
  randomized algorithms, including a random number generator.

  ### Command Reference and Sample Program ###

  As a stack operation, this instruction is prefixed by the [Space] IMP. The
  command code is selected to allow for future expansion of Whitespace's stack
  operations and in homage to a musical group that my wife assures me is not
  disco.

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Command</th> <th>Parameters</th> <th>Meaning</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[Tab][Tab][Space]</td> <td></td> <td>Randomly permute the order of all values on the stack.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  There is a sample program which prints out the digits 0-9 in a random order:
