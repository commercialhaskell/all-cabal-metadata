  # Change Log
  All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
  This project adheres to the [Package Versioning Policy](https://wiki.haskell.org/Package_versioning_policy).

  ## [3001.5.0.0]
  - Define a proper `MonadFail` instance for `CGIT`. This is necessary to compile
    successfully with `ghc-8.8.x` Since that change affects our public API, a
    major version bump is necessary.
  - The build no longer supports ghc prior to version 8.x.

  ## [3001.4.0.0]
  - Drop obsolete Network.CGI.Compat module. The code in that module relied on
    obsolete functions and types from `network` which have been dropped there in
    the latest 3.x release. Re-writing the Compat module to use the new types
    felt like it would defeat the purpose of the module, so we've dropped it
    instead.
  - Dropped the dependency on `network` altogether. We need `network-uri`,
    really. Giving up support for ancient versions of `network` allows us to drop
    the `network-uri` flag, too, simplifying our builds.
  - Dropped support for versions of `mtl` prior to 2.2.x. That version was
    released almost 5 years ago, so we can probably drop the compatibility code
    (and the `old-mtl` Cabal flag) without surprising anyone.
  - Added new `cookieHttpOnly` flag to the `Cookies` type. When set, the client's
    browser will prevent client side scripts from accessing the cookie.

  ## [3001.3.1.0]
  ### Changed
  - Our error handling functions `throwCGI`, `catchCGI`, `tryCGI`, and
    `handleExceptionCGI` are deprecated. These functions are trivial aliases for
    the corresponding functions from the `exceptions` library's `MonadCatch`
    class. Users should directly use those functions. They are more general and
    have better documentation.
  - Relax version constraints to allow building with network 2.8.x.

  ## [3001.3.0.3]
  ### Changed
  - Bumped upper version bounds for containers and time.
  - Updated to exceptions 0.10.x. This meant extending our `MonadMask` instance
    to provide the `generalBracket` method that was added to the class in recent
    versions of the exceptions library.
  - The doctest suite would not work reliably with different versions of Cabal.
    Instead of going all out with a custom written build system to support it
    properly, we now run doctests as part of our CI builds but not as a part of
    the Cabal build any more.
  - Fixed several compiler warnings in our code.

  ## [3001.3.0.2]
  ### Changed
  - Bumped QuickCheck upper bound to version < 2.10

  ## [3001.3.0.1]
  ### Changed
  - Bumped doctest to version < 0.12

  ## [3001.3.0.0]
  ### Changed
  - Cookie.hs: cookieExpires now has type `Maybe UTCTime` rather than
  `Maybe CalendarTime`
  - Protocol.hs: URL decoding functions no longer decode UTF-8 encoding
  - Functor and Applicative instance of CGIT no longer constrain Functor or
  Applicative parameter to be an instance of Monad

  ## [3001.2.2.3]
  ### Changed
  * CGI.hs haddock: Use web.archive.org link for CGI specification

  ## [3001.2.2.2]
  ### Changed
  - Added support for building with mtl < 2.2.1 via flags

  ## [3001.2.2.1]
  ### Changed
  - Bumped exceptions version to < 0.9

  ## [3001.2.2.0]
  ### Added
  - MonadMask instance for CGIT

  ## [3001.2.1.0]
  ### Added
  - Applicative instance for CGI Monad

  ### Changed
  - Deduplicate shared with `multipart` code

  ## 3001.2.0.0
  ### Changed
  - GHC 7.8.3 support

  This is a Haskell library for writing CGI programs.
  Its features include:

  - Access to CGI parameters (e.g. form input) from both
    GET and POST requests.
  - Access to CGI environment variables.
  - Ability to set arbitrary response headers.
  - Support for HTTP cookies.
  - An efficient implementation of multipart/form-data
    using Data.ByteString. This allows for efficient
    handling of file uploads.
  - A CGI monad transformer.
  - Basic exception handling and logging (these should be improved)
  - Low-level run functions that allow using programs written with
    this package with protocols other than CGI, for example FastCGI.
