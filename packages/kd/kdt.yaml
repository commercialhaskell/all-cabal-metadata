synopsis: Fast and flexible k-d trees for various types of point queries.
changelog: ! '# 0.2.4

  * Now exporting KdMap.Static.TreeNode to facilitate advanced usage of the library.


  # 0.2.3

  * For internal priority queue implementation, use the heap library instead of pqueue
  library in order to build on ghc 7.10.


  # 0.2.2

  * Relax lower version bound on QuickCheck to 2.5.


  # 0.2.1

  * Relax upper version constraint for MonadRandom (benchmarking code)

  * Add Data.Point2d as dependency of executables so tests and benchmarks can be built
  from the archive downloaded on Hackage.


  # 0.2.0

  * Lots and lots of renaming all throughout to more closely match terminology used
  in `containers`.

  * Removed kdt library dependency on QuickCheck (if not building testing code).

  * Removed testing module Point2d from public API

  * All structures now have Show instance

  * Static variants now have functions for dynamically inserting new points into existing
  structure, with caveat that these functions do not maintain balanced tree structure.

description: ! 'This package includes static and dynamic versions of k-d trees,

  as well as \"Map\" variants that store data at each point in the

  k-d tree structure. Supports nearest neighbor,

  k nearest neighbors, points within a given radius, and points

  within a given range.

  To learn to use this package, start with the documentation for

  the "Data.KdTree.Static" module.'
