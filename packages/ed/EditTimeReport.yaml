description: |-
  This program can be used to see exactly how much time
  you spent working on file X, project Y or language Z.
  It can also be used to see for instance what your most
  productive time of the year, month or week is.
  In the long-run, this might help you make better time
  estimates, while also providing you with an overview
  of what you have worked on (which can also be nice for CV's).
  In short; this program allows you to query your logs
  and generate reports in plain text, html, xhtml and CSV.
  Support for more output formats is planned for the future.
  See the github page for more information.
