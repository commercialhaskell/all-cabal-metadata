description: |-
  The Eden Trace Viewer is a tool designed to help
  programmers optimize Eden programs by visualising traces
  (eventlog files) of Eden program runs. It is similar to
  (and precedes) threadscope. However, it has been designed
  to visualize not just threads, but also different
  machines, processes, and messages between processes.
  EdenTV can show you what has happened during the
  execution of your program. This is very helpful to
  optimize parallel programs.
