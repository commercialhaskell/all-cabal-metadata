  # Changelog

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2025-09-17

  * PATCH: update the changelog to change the release date of version 0.0.1.0 from
    2024-02-05 to 2024-02-13.
  * PATCH: transfer ownership to the Haskell Foundation.
  * BREAKING: Fix a few FFI bindings that have `FunPtr`s in their type where they
    should not. This is considered a breaking change because the types of the FFI
    bindings were changed as a result.
  * PATCH: include a license file (with copyright info)
  * PATCH: make dependency bounds on `base` tighter. Now they coincide with the
    `tested-with` versions of GHC.

  ## 0.0.1.0 -- 2024-02-13

  Initial release.

  # Welcome to botan-bindings

  Raw bindings to the [Botan](https://botan.randombit.net/) cryptography library.

  > Botan's goal is to be the best option for cryptography in C++ by offering the tools necessary to implement a range of practical systems, such as TLS protocol, X.509 certificates, modern AEAD ciphers, PKCS#11 and TPM hardware support, password hashing, and post quantum crypto schemes.

  For more information, see the [README on Github](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/botan)
