description: "[box](https://tonyday567.github.io/box/index.html) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tonyday567/box.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/tonyday567/box)\n===\n\n>
  The box is dark and full of terrors.\n\nTake two ubiquitous concepts. There are
  things that emit stuff. They instantiate a particular thing on demand, somehow and
  somewhere beyond our concern and frame of reference.  We ask for an `a` and an `a`
  is there, or not (the thing is a `Maybe a`). The library calls this an Emitter:\n\n```\nnewtype
  Emitter m a = Emitter { emit :: m (Maybe a)}\n```\n\nAnd then there is the opposite.
  \ There are things that commit stuff. We offer them a particular thing and they
  take it away beyond our concerns. It is committed to the void. We offer an `a` and
  it is committed, or not. The library calls this a Committer:\n\n```\nnewtype Committer
  m a = Committer { commit :: a -> m Bool}\n```\n\nWhen you have both things, something
  that emits and something that commits, and you product them, the library calls this
  a Box:\n\n```\ndata Box m c e = Box\n  { committer :: Committer m c\n  , emitter
  :: Emitter m e\n  }\n```\n\nIf you choose to see the committer as a conduit into
  the box, the emitter as a conduit out of the box, and remove concern about what
  is going on inside the box, then this frame of reference is often called a black
  box. Or you can choose to think from inside the box. From inside the box, there
  is again a conduit coming in that emits and a conduit going out that commits. You
  can take those things being emitted, turn them into something else and emit them.
  \ You are the black box. \n\nNote how you can get confused with these metaphors.
  \ The wire going into the box is a committer from a point of view outside the metaphorical
  box but looks like an emitter from the inside. The wire going out is a committer
  from the inside and an emitter from the outside.\n\nThe key to understanding this
  library is to resist having to choose a single frame of reference and, instead,
  focus on the types.\n\nA `Box m c e` unifies the functorial wrapper `m` of the emitter
  and committer, which is what really makes it a functional box. `m` can be IO but
  is also often Software Transactional Memory (STM) which is the sanest environment
  for concurrent programming in all of the codingshpere. Boxes can often be hooked
  together at this level for useful efficiencies.\n\nBoxes have a monoidal instance.
  \ They can be mappended together to form a new box and complexity stays constant.\n\nA
  Box is also a [profunctor](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2019/03/27/promonads-arrows-and-einstein-notation-for-profunctors/)
  and, to quote Bartos, a profunctor can be used to glue together two categories.
  A Box.Transducer, a stateful stream converter with a Category instance, can be used
  to connect up a box to create a sound compositional building block for arbitrarily
  complex problems.\n\nLike other paradigms, boxes can be not fun places to get stuck
  in.  Much of the library are not, in fact, emitters and committers but emitter,
  committer and box continuations. If you gave me something that takes a box and does
  something, then I'll give you a something is a natural piece of logic within the
  library context, and so large parts of the functionality are [continuation-parsing
  style](https://ro-che.info/articles/2019-06-07-why-use-contt).\n\nFinally, the interface
  between boxes is a natural place to create concurrency, and Box.Queue provides queues
  that are guaranteed to not race or block.\n\n\n> “Do not define me by my gender
  or my socio-economic status, Noah Willis. Do not tell me who I am and do not tell
  me who society thinks I am and then put me in that box and expect me to stay there.
  Because, I swear to God, I will climb the hell out of that box and I will take that
  box you've just put me in and I will use that box to smash your face in until you're
  nothing more than a freckly, bloodied pulp. You got that, sweet cheeks?” ~ Megan
