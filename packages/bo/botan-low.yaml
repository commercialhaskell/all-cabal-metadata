  # Changelog

  ## 0.0.2.0 -- 2025-09-17

  * PATCH: update the changelog to change the release date of version 0.0.1.0 from
    2024-02-05 to 2024-02-13.
  * PATCH: transfer ownership to the Haskell Foundation.
  * NON-BREAKING: remove a bunch of `WARNING` pragmas in favour of textual
    reminders in haddock comments. The `WARNING` pragmas are somewhat inconvenient
    in conjunction with `-Werror`. What would help is that since `ghc-9.12`,
    warnings can be assigned to categories, and those categories can be ignored
    more granularly. However, we support `ghc` versions down to and including
    `ghc-9.2`, so warning categories are not an option for now. The affected
    functions are:

    - `blockCipherEncryptBlocks`
    - `blockCipherDecryptBlocks`
    - `pwdhash`
    - `pwdhashTimed`
    - `mkCreateObjectCBytes`
    - `x509CertAllowedUsage`
    - `x509CertHostnameMatch`
    - `keyAgreement`
    - `signFinish`
  * PATCH: include a license file (with copyright info)
  * PATCH: make dependency bounds on `base` tighter. Now they coincide with the
    `tested-with` versions of GHC.

  ## 0.0.1.0 - 2024-02-13

  Initial release.

  # Welcome to botan-low

  Low-level bindings to the [Botan](https://botan.randombit.net/) cryptography library.

  > Botan's goal is to be the best option for cryptography in C++ by offering the tools necessary to implement a range of practical systems, such as TLS protocol, X.509 certificates, modern AEAD ciphers, PKCS#11 and TPM hardware support, password hashing, and post quantum crypto schemes.

  For more information, see the [README on Github](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/botan)
