description: |-
  The Nussinov78 RNA secondary structure prediction algorithm
  using the ADPfusion framework.

  This algorithm is simple enough to be used as a tutorial-type
  example. It also shows that efficient code is possible. The
  ADPfusion code compared to C is slower by a factor of only 1.2.
  We plan to improve upon this.

  A number of helper functions currently present in
  BioInf.Nussinov78 will later move in their own library.

  Build using GHC-7.6.1, the new code generator and llvm for best
  performance.

  For comparison, a version of the algorithm written in C is
  available under C/nussinov.c. Use at least
  "gcc -O3 nussinov.c".
