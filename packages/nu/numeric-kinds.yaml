description: |-
  This provides numeric types meant for use at the type level with -XDataKinds,
  along with type families that act like type-level typeclasses providing
  various operations.

  Currently, this primarily exists in support of
  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/snumber snumber> and
  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dependent-literals-plugin dependent-literals-plugin>,
  and the only type-level numeric type in the current version is @Integer@.
