description: |-
  txt-sushi is a collection of command line utilities for processing
  comma-separated and tab-delimited files (AKA flat files, spreadsheets).
  The most important utility (tssql) lets you perform SQL selects on CSV files.
  By focusing exclusively on processing text files with a tabular structure,
  TxtSushi simplifies common tasks like filtering, joining and transformation
  that would take more effort to accomplish with a general purpose text
  processing language.
