  # runhs

  Stack wrapper for single-file Haskell programs.

  Declare package dependencies in the source code of your single-file Haskell program. Easily and reliably run your program, compile it, or load it in GHCi or Ghcid.


  ## Install

  1. First, install [Stack](https://haskellstack.org).

  2. Add Stack's install directory to your `PATH`.

    * **Windows:** Installing Stack automatically adds its install directory to your `PATH`.

    * **Most Linux:** `echo 'export PATH="${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}"' >> ~/.profile && export PATH="${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}"`

    * **MacOS Pre-Catalina:** `echo 'export PATH="${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}"' >> ~/.bash_profile && export PATH="${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}"`

    * **MacOS Catalina and newer:** `echo 'export PATH="${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}"' >> ~/.zshrc && export PATH="${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}"`

  3. Finally, use one of the following install methods.

    * **Stack (recommended):** `stack install runhs`

    * **Download:** Download the appropriate executable for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/friedbrice/runhs/releases/), unzip it, and put it somewhere on your `PATH`.


  ## Usage

  Add a block comment (the _front matter_) at the start of any single-file Haskell program in the following format:

  ```
  {-
  resolver: lts-16.6
  packages:
    - bytestring
    - containers
  -}
  ```

  The front matter must be the first block comment in your file, and the comment delimiters `{-` and `-}` must appear on their own lines, just as above.

  The `resolver` property is required and must be a valid [Stackage resolver](https://www.stackage.org/snapshots). The `packages` property is required if your Haskell program depends on external packages, but may be omitted if your Haskell program does not.

  Once you have the appropriate front matter at the top of your file, you may load your program in _Watch Mode_ or in _Interactive Mode_ (a.k.a. _REPL Mode_) in GHCi, or run your program as a script, or compile your program, using the following command format.

  ```
  runhs (watch|repl|script|compile) <file> [<args>]
  ```
