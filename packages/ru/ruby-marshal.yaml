synopsis: Parse a subset of Ruby objects serialised with Marshal.dump.
changelog: |
  # 0.2.0

  - Added `MonadFail` instance for `Marshal` (#62)

  # 0.1.3

  - Relaxed version bounds.

  # 0.1.2

  - Relaxed version bounds.

  # 0.1.1

  - Added some minor style changes.
  - Relaxed mtl lower bound.

  # 0.1.0

  - Separated modules by concern.
  - Hid underlying Get monad from consumers to allow us to change the parsing
    library without breaking consumers should a more performant one become
    available.
  - Added Rubyable type class to make it easier to go between RubyObject and plain
    Haskell values.
  - Replaced Double with Float as per Marshal format.
  - Replaced internal representation of Hash with Vector of tuples to simplify
    Rubyable type class and usage for consumers.
  - Added more type safety by extracting ADT of all possible Ruby string
    encodings.
  - Re-ordered parser to try parsing simpler objects first.
  - Used strict State monad instead of non-strict.

  # 0.0.1

  - Completed fully-functioning parser for a subset of Ruby objects serialised
    with Ruby's Marshal format.
