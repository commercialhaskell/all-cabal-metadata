description: |-
  This package contains a collection of explicit Runge-Kutta
  methods of various orders, some with fixed-size steps (no
  error estimate) and some intended for adaptive stepsize
  (ie, they include an error estimate). There are a couple of
  test programs which include some adaptive stepsize control,
  however there is not yet any such routine in the library
  itself.

  This package started as a fork of 'rungekutta-1.0.3' (which had been dormant since 2009), with proper documentation and modern project structure.
