  ## 0.9.0.7 (2019-01-04)

  Note that this will be the last release in the `0.9` series, excepting
  critical bug fixes or security issues. The next release is expected to
  (slightly) break module export compatibility, but in a way that should
  not affect too many users.

  Changes:

    - Support for Stackage LTS 12, LTS 13.
    - Support for GHC 8.4.4, 8.6.3.
    - Copyright for the project has been re-assigned to Drew Hess, its
      original author.
    - Drop support for nixpkgs-stackage overlays, no longer maintained
      upstream.

  ## 0.9.0.6 (2018-04-03)

  Changes:

    - Support for GHC 8.4.1.

    - Bump hlint upper bound.

    - Drop support for all Stackage LTS pre-9.

    - Drop support for GHC pre-8.

  ## 0.9.0.5 (2018-02-05)

  Changes:

    - Support async-2.2.x.

  ## 0.9.0.4 (2018-01-29)

  Changes:
    - The `test-hlint` cabal flag is now disabled by default.
    - Tested with GHC 8.2.2.
    - Clean up the sdist to include just what's required for Cabal/Stack
      builds.
    - Updated copyright year.
    - Requires `hlint` 2.0.*.
    - More Nix and Hydra improvements, including Nix/Hydra builds
      against LTS package sets, rather than just the pinned Nixpkgs
      package set.

  Fixes:
    - All dependencies should now have PVP bounds.

  ## 0.9.0.3 (2018-01-25)

  Changes:
    - Bump QuickCheck, hlint bounds.
    - Add GHC 8.2.2 to .travis.yml.
    - Much improved Nix support, including a default fixed nixpkgs
      revision and Hydra jobsets.
    - Stackage LTS 10 support.

  Fixes:
    - Fixed new hlint issues.

  ## 0.9.0.2 (2017-10-18)

  Changes:
    - Revert to manual imports in top-level modules for better Haddocks.

  Fixes:
    - Fix source path in hpio.nix.
    - Remove macOS builds from Travis-CI config; they're just too slow.

  ## 0.9.0.1 (2017-10-16)

  Fixes:
    - Better Nix packaging.
    - Add a few missing files to extra-source-files.

  ## 0.9.0.0 (2017-10-02)

  Changes:
    - This project now uses Protolude (0.2.*). I believe the only visible
      API change is that SysfsException's string type is now Text,
      instead of String.
    - Add monad and transformer instances for transformers-base,
      monad-control, and monad-logger monads.
    - Use DefaultSignatures and ConstraintKinds to simplify the
      implementation.
    - Use hpack to generate the project's Cabal file.

  Fixes:
    - Add some new compile-time warnings.
    - Remove redundant Functor and Applicative constraints.
    - Update Travis-CI config to test against more recent Stackage LTS
      and GHC releases.
    - Remove most of the Travis-CI macOS jobs; they're really slow.
    - Get all supported GHC/Stackage LTS versions to build again.

  ## 0.8.0.10 (2017-06-28)

  Fixes:
    - Bump QuickCheck bounds.
    - Bump optparse-applicative bounds.
    - Stack: update to lts-8.20.

  ## 0.8.0.9 (2017-05-24)

  Fixes:
    - Fix project URLs.

  ## 0.8.0.8 (2017-05-24)

  No changes; copyright for the project has been assigned to Quixoftic, LLC.

  ## 0.8.0.7 (2017-02-21)

  Fixes:
    - Fix hlint tests.
    - Note GHC 8.0.2 compatibility in cabal file.

  Fixes:
    - Remove hspec upper bounds.

  ## 0.8.0.5 (2017-01-11)

  Fixes:
    - Bump directory bounds.

  ## 0.8.0.4 (2016-10-26)

  Fixes:
    - Support for optparse-applicative 0.13.x.
    - Bump hspec bounds.

  ## 0.8.0.3 (2016-07-15)

  Fixes:
    - Bump QuickCheck bounds.

  ## 0.8.0.2 (2016-06-08)

  Fixes:
    - Fix Stackage doctests issue (#48).

  ## 0.8.0.1 (2016-05-30)

  # hpio

  `hpio` provides support for writing GPIO programs in Haskell. It
  includes an embedded DSL for writing platform-independent programs,
  along with low-level monads and IO functions which provide direct
  access to each supported platform's native GPIO API.

  Currently only the Linux `sysfs` GPIO filesystem is supported, but
  support for other Unix GPIO platforms is planned.

  For details on usage, see the included tutorial module, or the
  `examples` directory in the source distribution.
