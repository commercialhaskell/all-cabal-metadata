synopsis: A Haskell pre-processor
changelog: ! "# 0.6.0\n\n- Various bug fixes by @rahulmutt. These may change behavior
  not captured by the MCPP test suite.\n- Switch to `unordered-containers` from `bytestring-trie`
  for stackage compatibility\n- Internal refactoring\n\n# 0.5.1\nAdded the `expand`
  API for pure macro processing (i.e. `#include`s are ignored).\n\n# 0.5.0\n- Redesigned
  library API\nThe `Hpp` module exports the main pieces. `Hpp.Env`, `Hpp.Types`, and
  `Hpp.Config` may be used for configuring the preprocessor.\n\n# 0.4.0\n\n- Simplify
  the parsing machinery\n- Don't remove C++-style single-line comments\n- Don't error
  on unknown cpp directives\n  Previously, a line beginning with \"#-}\" would cause
  an error\n- Don't do trigraph replacement by default.\n  Haskell allows \"??\" in
  operator names and you can be sure `lens` uses it!\n\n# 0.3.1\n\nAddress a change
  wherein GHC 8 will pass `-include` arguments without a space between \"-include\"
  and the file to be included.\n\n# 0.3\n\nSwitch to a stream processing model.\n\nThis
  library is designed to have minimal dependencies, so we now have\na bespoke implementation
  of a cross between the pipes and machines\nlibraries included.\n\nThis change was
  done to make some parsing\noperations easier, believe it or not. For example, most
  pre-processing\nis done on a line-by-line basis, but we must also support macro\nfunction
  applications that cross line boundaries. Thus the expansion\nlogic can not merely
  be given one line at a time from an input\nfile. Previously, a heuristic tried to
  combine consecutive lines\nbefore the parsing stage. Now, the parser itself is able
  to pull\ntokens in across lines when necessary.\n\nTL;DR: The upshot is that processing
  `/usr/include/stdio.h` on OS X (a\nsurprisingly complicated file!)  now uses 78%
  of the time and 0.38%\nthe memory of previous versions of `hpp`.\n\n# 0.1\n\nFirst
  release!\n"

description: ! "# The `hpp` Executable\n`hpp` is a Haskell pre-processor that is also
  a C90-compatible\npre-processor (with the addition of a `--cpp` flag). It is\npackaged
  as both a library and an executable.\n\nTo use as a Haskell preprocessor for resolving
  `#ifdef` conditionals\nand macro expansion, an invocation might look like,\n\n```\nhpp
  -DDEBUG Foo.hs\n```\n\nTo use as a C preprocessor, an invocation might look like,\n\n```\nhpp
  -DDEBUG --cpp foo.c\n```\n\nTo have GHC use `hpp` as the C pre-processor, add this
  line to the top\nof a Haskell source file that makes use of the `CPP` `LANGUAGE`\npragma,\n\n```\n{-#
  OPTIONS_GHC -cpp -pgmPhpp #-}\n```\n\nOr add this line to your `.cabal` file:\n\n```\nghc-options:
  -pgmPhpp\n```\n\nNote that you will need to ensure that the `hpp` executable is
  available in your build environment (e.g. you can add `hpp` as a `build-depends`
  in your `.cabal` file).\n\n# The `hpp` Library\n\nThe `hpp` executable is a command-line
  interface to the `hpp` library. While the `hpp` package has been designed to have
  minimal dependencies beyond what the `GHC` compiler itself uses, it does include
  a few small, framework-free unit tests that demonstrate basic usage as a library.
  In the `testIf` example, we preprocess the `sourceIfdef` input with a starting definition
  equivalent to `#define FOO 1`. In `testArith1`, we exercise basic integer arithmetic
  and comparison. The `hppHelper` function shows how to run your source input through
  the preprocessor: `expand initialState (preproces mySource)`. If you want to support
  `#include`ing other files, you will use `runHpp` or `streamHpp` that operate in
  `IO` and support searching among a list of include paths.\n\n```haskell\n{-# LANGUAGE
