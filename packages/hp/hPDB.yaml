description: "hPDB\n====\nHaskell PDB file format parser.\n\n[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/BioHaskell/hPDB.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BioHaskell/hPDB)\n[![Hackage](https://budueba.com/hackage/hPDB)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hPDB)\n[![Hackage
  Dependencies](https://img.shields.io/hackage-deps/v/hPDB.svg?style=flat)](http://packdeps.haskellers.com/feed?needle=hPDB)\n\nProtein
  Data Bank file format is a most popular format for holding biomolecule data.\n\nThis
  is a very fast parser:\n\n - below 7s for the largest entry in PDB - 1HTQ which
  is over 70MB\n - as compared with 11s of RASMOL 2.7.5,\n - or 2m15s of BioPython
  with Python 2.6 interpreter.\n\nIt is aimed to not only deliver event-based interface,
  but also a high-level data structure for manipulating data in spirit of BioPython's
  PDB parser. \n\nDetails on official releases are on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hPDB)\n\nThis
  package is also a part of [Stackage](http://www.stackage.org/package/hPDB) - a stable
  subset of Hackage.\n\nProjects for the future:\n------------------------\n\nPlease
  let me know if you would be willing to push the project further.\n\nIn particular
  one may considering these features:\n\n* Implement basic spatial operations of RMS
  superposition (with SVD),\naffine transform on a substructure.\n* Use `lens` to
  facilitate access to the data structures.\n    - torsion angles within protein/RNA
  chain.\n* Add Octree to the default data structure (with automatic update.)\n* Migrate
  out of `text-format`, since it gives portability trouble, and slows things down
  when printing.\n* Write a combinator library for generic fast parsing.\n* Checking
  whether GHC 7.8 improved efficiency of fixed point arithmetic,\nsince PDB coordinates
  have dynamic range of just ~2^20 bits, with smallest\nstep of 0.001.\n* Class-based
  wrappers showing Structure-Model-Chain-Residue-Atom interface\nwith possible wrapping
  of Repa/Accelerate arrays for fast computation.\n\nPlease ask me any questions on
  [Gitter](https://gitter.im/mgajda).\n"
