description: ! "# hpqtypes [![Hackage version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/hpqtypes.svg?label=Hackage)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hpqtypes)
  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/scrive/hpqtypes.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/scrive/hpqtypes)\n\nEfficient
  and easy-to-use bindings to (slightly modified) libpqtypes,\nlipq extension that
  adds support for binary transport format and\ncomposite types.\n\nSince modified
  libpqtypes is used, its source code is bundled along\nwith the bindings. The differences
  between verbatim libpqtypes and the\none used by this package:\n\n* per-thread global
  error structures were replaced by explicit passing\n  of these structures around
  so that there is no need to use bound\n  threads.\n\n* handlers that take values
  to be put into the database were modified\n  to always expect pointers to objects,
  as opposed to previous\n  situation where primitives were being taken by value (which
  was\n  convenient if the library was used directly from C, but created\n  inconsistency
  problems while trying to define bindings in a sensible\n  way).\n\nExamples can
  be found in the [examples](https://github.com/scrive/hpqtypes/tree/master/examples)
  directory.\n"
