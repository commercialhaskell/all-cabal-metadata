  # hpqtypes [![Hackage version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/hpqtypes.svg?label=Hackage)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hpqtypes) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/scrive/hpqtypes.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/scrive/hpqtypes)

  Efficient and easy-to-use bindings to (slightly modified) libpqtypes,
  lipq extension that adds support for binary transport format and
  composite types.

  Since modified libpqtypes is used, its source code is bundled along
  with the bindings. The differences between verbatim libpqtypes and the
  one used by this package:

  * per-thread global error structures were replaced by explicit passing
    of these structures around so that there is no need to use bound
    threads.

  * handlers that take values to be put into the database were modified
    to always expect pointers to objects, as opposed to previous
    situation where primitives were being taken by value (which was
    convenient if the library was used directly from C, but created
    inconsistency problems while trying to define bindings in a sensible
    way).

  Examples can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/scrive/hpqtypes/tree/master/examples) directory.
