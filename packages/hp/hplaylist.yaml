description: "=== What is hplaylist? ===\n\nThis is a utility for extracting the contents
  of an iTunes playlist\nand copying the associated files to an external MP3 player.
  I've\ntested this with a Sansa Clip running Rockbox, but any player that\nmounts
  like a USB disk and uses a similar directory structure should\nwork. It assumes
  that playlists live in a folder called \"Playlists\"\nin the root player directory
  and music files live in a folder called\n\"Music\" in the root player directory.
  The Music folder can be (and is) \norganized according to artist and album. It should
  be easy to change\nthe code to reflect a different directory structure. Patches
  to make\nthis configurable rather than requiring source modifications would be\nwelcome.\n\nThe
  AppleScript contained in Applescript.hs does all the real work of\ndumping the contents
  of an iTunes playlist to a file. This code is\nadapter from Bery Rinaldo's \"Export
  Playlist to M3U\" script, found at:\nhttp://homepage.mac.com/beryrinaldo/AudioTron/Export_Playlist_to_M3U/\n\nDue
  to the use of AppleScript, I expect that this application is Mac-\nonly. But I would
  welcome patches to make it work on other platforms.\n\n=== Installation ===\n\n$
  runhaskell Setup configure --configure-option=--music-player-root=/Volumes/SANSA\\
  CLIP \\\n   --configure-option=--m4a-dir=/Users/tjc/converted\n$ runhaskell Setup
  build\n$ sudo runhaskell Setup install\n\nIn place of \"/Volumes/SANSA\\ CLIP\",
  substitute where your machine mounts your music player.\nIn place of /Users/tjc/converted,
  substitute a cache directory containing .mp3 files. If you\nsupply this config-time
  option and your playlist contains .m4a files, hplaylist will look\nin the cache
  directory for a corresponding .mp3 files instead of in wherever iTunes claims\nthe
  file is. This is meant to support devices that can't play .m4a files. You can omit\nthe
  --m4a-dir option, but you must supply the --music-player-root option.\n\n=== Usage
  ===\n\n$ hplaylist \"gym February 2011\"\n\nwhere the name in quotes is the name
  of an iTunes playlist. You can also do:\n\n$ hplaylist --dry-run \"gym February
  2011\"\n\nand instead of copying files directly to your device, hplaylist will generate
  a\nshell script that, when executed, copies all the files in the \"gym February
  2011\"\nplaylist. For example, hplaylist might print out:\n\nTo copy the files,
  execute the script /var/folders/Ig/Ig9WMUQwHsWDznqEdIsAfU+++TI/-Tmp-/hplaylist_copyit5084\n\nand
  then you could read the file /var/folders/Ig/Ig9WMUQwHsWDznqEdIsAfU+++TI/-Tmp-/hplaylist_copyit5084
  \nbefore you execute it, to make sure everything looks OK.\n\n==== Flags ====\n\n--dry-run
  doesn't change any files on your device, but rather,\ncreates a shell script that
  can be executed to copy the files.\n\n--quiet suppresses most output from hplaylist.\n\n--keep-temp-files
  stops intermediate files from being\ndeleted (mostly for developers).\n\n--temp-dir
  DIRECTORY attempts to store any files that are created\nin DIRECTORY. By default,
  hplaylist uses the current directory.\n\n=== Gotchas ===\n\nhplaylist will not delete
  any existing files on your player. It also won't clobber\nfiles with the same name
  that already exist. I usually just delete everything using\nthe Finder, and run
  hplaylist to set things up afresh.\n\n=== Github page ===\n\nhttps://github.com/catamorphism/hplaylist\n\n===
  Known issues ===\n\nFilenames containing special characters do not currently get
  escaped correctly. Such files\nget ignored. You'll have to rename your Moxy FruÌˆvous
  tracks or copy them by hand.\n \n=== Further questions ===\n\nPatches, bug reports:
