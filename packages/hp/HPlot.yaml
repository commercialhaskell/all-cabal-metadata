description: |
  This package provides simple monadic interface to the PLplot cross-platform software
  package for creating scientific plots.

  Haddock documentation (hyperlinked with source code) is available from homepage

  PlplotCanvas widget is implemented to be compatible with gtk2hs. PLplot type class allows
  addition of other display drivers without need to adopt application code

  The idea was that with the help of PLplotM monad it should be easy to make
  more abstract interfaces and combinators to do plots
