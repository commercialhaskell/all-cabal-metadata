  * switched to GLUT
  * removed no-grapher flag
  * added a simple test example

  0.4.1 - 090809
  * added no-grapher flag to cabal due to GLFW breakage

  0.4.0 - 090802
  * unified some functions by introducing the graph mode type

  0.3.0 - 090729
  * can handle the case when the executable doesn't create a .hp file or
    doesn't even start

  0.2.0 - 090717
  * factored OpenGL graphing capabilities into a library

  0.1.0 - 090629
  * added a basic relay server
  * added remote profiling capability to the grapher

  0.0.0 - 090613
  * first public version featuring separate and cumulative graphs as
    well

description: |-
  This package contains two utilities: a grapher that can display heap
  profiles in real time both for local and remote processes, and a
  relay application the grapher connects to in the latter case.
  Additionally, the graphing capability is exposed to other programs
  as well in the form of a library module.

  To avoid the need for OpenGL on the server side, the package can be
  built with the @ServerOnly@ flag:

  @cabal install --flags=serveronly@
