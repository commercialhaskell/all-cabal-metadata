description: |-
  An incomplete component of the Hpc toolkit which provides the
  ability to step through coverage ticks as they happen, giving a
  poor mans debugger.  Requires the binary being traced to be build
  using a specific version of ghc-6.7, so YMWV.
  The plan is to port this to the new GHC API, giving both tracing
  and free variable examination via an Ajax interface.
