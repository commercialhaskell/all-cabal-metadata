description: |-
  Podcasting is a method of publishing radio-like programs on the
  Internet.  Through podcasting, almost anyone can produce their own
  audio program, and publish episodes of it as often or as rarely as
  they like.

  To listen to podcasts, you need a program to download the podcast's
  episodes from the Internet.  Such a program is called a podcatcher
  (or sometimes a podcast aggregator).  hpodder is this program.

  hpodder's features include:

  Convenient, easy to learn, and fast command-line interface.  It's
  simple to do simple things, and advanced things are possible.

  Automatic discovery of feed metadata

  Full history database for accurate prevention of duplicate
  downloads and tracking of new episodes

  Conversion tools to convert your existing feed list and history from
  other applications to hpodder.  Supported applications and formats
  include: castpodder and ipodder.

  Most operations can work fully automatically across your entire
  podcast database, or they can work manually.

  Automatic updating of ID3 (v1 and v2) tags based on metadata in the
  podcast feed.  This important feature is available through iTunes but
  is often missed by other podcatchers.

  hpodder operations can be easily scripted or scheduled using regular
  operating system tools.

  Fully customizable naming scheme for downloaded episodes, including a
  name collision detection and workaround algorithm.

  Automatic support for appending .mp3 extensions to MP3 files that
  lack them.

  Numerous database and history inquiry tools

  Small, minimalist footprint

  Power users and developers can interact directly with the embedded
  Sqlite3 database used by hpodder.  The database has a simple schema
  that is developer-friendly.

  Support for resuming interrupted downloads of podcasts

  hpodder is SAFE and is designed with data integrity in mind from the
  beginning.  It should be exceedingly difficult to lose a podcast
  episode, even in the event of a power failure.
