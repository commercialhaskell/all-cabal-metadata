  Support for bytestring based filepath manipulation, similar to 'filepath'.

  This package is part of the HPath suite, also check out:

  * [hpath](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hpath)
  * [hpath-directory](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hpath-directory)
  * [hpath-io](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hpath-io)

  ## Motivation

  This is basically a fork of [posix-paths](https://github.com/JohnLato/posix-paths), which seemed to have stalled development.

  There is also a similar library [filepath-bytestring](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/filepath-bytestring), but it doesn't follow an open development model and is cross-platform, which this library is not interested in.

  ## Differences to 'posix-paths'

  * uses the `word8` package for save word8 literals instead of `OverloadedStrings`
  * `hasTrailingPathSeparator` and `dropTrailingPathSeparator` behave in the same way as their `System.FilePath` counterpart
  * has some additional functions

  ## Differences to 'filepath-bytestring'

  * uses the `word8` package for save word8 literals instead of `OverloadedStrings`
  * is not cross-platform (less odd code to maintain)
  * has some additional functions
