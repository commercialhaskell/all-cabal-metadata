description: "---------------------------------- HPong ----------------------------------\r\n\r\nWith
  the release of the Haskell Platform it is now trivial to start making\r\nOpenGL
  programs with Haskell.\r\n\r\nHPong is a very simple OpenGL game that was made both
  to experiment with\r\nOpenGL and as a starting point for more complex games, since
  there seem\r\nto be fairly few examples of GLFW programs in Haskell.\r\n\r\nControls
  : Up arrow moves your paddle up.\r\n           Down arrow moves your paddle down.\r\n
  \          Esc quits the game.\r\n\r\nHPong is based on GLFW instead of GLUT for
  the simple reason that GLUT\r\ndoes not provide a working window close callback. "
