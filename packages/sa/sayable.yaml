  This package provides a set of data structures, classes and operators that
  facilitate the construction of a Prettyprinter Doc object.  The difference
  between this an Prettyprinter is:

  * Additional "saytag" parameter that can be used to control the Doc rendering.

  * Brevity of syntax (using operators) designed to enhance conversion of
  arguments and readability of messages and conversion
