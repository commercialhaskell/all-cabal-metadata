description: "\r\n                      Salsa: a .NET bridge for Haskell\r\n                     \r\n
  \ Salsa is an experimental Haskell library and code generator that allows\r\n  Haskell
  programs to host the .NET runtime and interact with .NET libraries.\r\n  It uses
  type families extensively to provide a type-safe mapping of the .NET\r\n  object
  model in the Haskell type system.\r\n\r\nWhat's in the package:\r\n\r\n  * 'Foreign'
  contains the Haskell library 'Foreign.Salsa'.  \r\n\r\n    This library provides
  the Haskell-side interface to Salsa, including:\r\n    functions to load the .NET
  runtime into the process, functions for\r\n    interacting with .NET classes and
  objects, and the required type-level\r\n    machinery.  It works together with the
  Haskell modules created by the\r\n    generator (see below) to provide access to
  .NET classes and their members.\r\n\r\n  * 'Driver' contains the Salsa .NET driver
  assembly (Salsa.dll).\r\n\r\n    The driver assembly contains .NET code that is
  loaded automatically by the\r\n    Salsa library when the .NET runtime is loaded
  into the process.  It\r\n    provides run-time code generation facilities for calling
  in and out of the\r\n    .NET runtime from Haskell.  The assembly binary (Salsa.dll)
  is embedded in\r\n    'Foreign\\Salsa\\Driver.hs' using the 'Embed.hs' utility program.\r\n\r\n
  \ * 'Generator' contains the Salsa binding generator.\r\n\r\n    The generator is
  a C# program that creates Haskell modules from .NET\r\n    metadata to provide type-safe
  access to the requested .NET classes and\r\n    methods in .NET assembilies.\r\n
  \   \r\n    Note: the generator requires .NET 3.5 because it uses the 'System.Linq'\r\n
  \         namespace.\r\n\r\n  * 'Samples' contains a few Haskell programs that use
  Salsa.\r\n\r\n    - Hello:   a basic console 'Hello World' program.\r\n\r\n    -
  Weather: a console program that asynchronously downloads the Sydney\r\n               weather
  forecast and displays it.\r\n\r\n    - Conway:  a simulator for Conway's Game of
  Life with a Windows\r\n               Presentation Foundation GUI.  (Requires .NET
  3.0 or later.)\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n\r\n  * GHC 7.8\r\n  \r\n    Salsa makes
  use of extensions that have only been available since version\r\n    7.8 of GHC.\r\n\r\n
  \ * Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 / Mono\r\n\r\n    Since the Generator requires
  .NET 3.5, any Salsa development also requires\r\n    this version.  Executables
  produced with Salsa however will run with just\r\n    .NET 2.0 (provided that only
  .NET 2.0 assemblies are used by the program).\r\n\r\n    Salsa will not work with
  versions 1.0/1.1 of the .NET Framework\r\n\r\n    Building with Mono and running
  Salsa executables on Mono works. Salsa\r\n    will be built with Mono if not running
  on Windows or the flag 'use_mono'\r\n    is used when building with Cabal. \r\n\r\nBuilding:\r\n\r\n
  \ First build the Salsa.dll driver assembly. (See the README file within the 'Driver\r\n
  \ directory).\r\n\r\n  Then build an install the Salsa library using Cabal as usual:\r\n\r\n
  \   cabal install\r\n\r\nAuthors:\r\n\r\n  Andrew Appleyard\r\n  Tim Matthews\r\n\r\n"
