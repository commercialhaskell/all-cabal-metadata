description: ! '/NaCl/ (pronounced \"salt\") is a new easy-to-use high-speed software

  library for network communication, encryption, decryption,

  signatures, etc. NaCl''s goal is to provide all of the core

  operations needed to build higher-level cryptographic tools.


  <http://nacl.cr.yp.to/>


  /Sodium/ is a portable, cross-compilable, installable, packageable

  crypto library based on NaCl, with a compatible API.


  <https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium>


  /Saltine/ is a Haskell binding to the NaCl primitives going through

  Sodium for build convenience and, eventually, portability.'
