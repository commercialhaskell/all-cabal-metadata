description: |-
  This package provides a type class
  to handle signed and unsigned samples
  of various size and number of channels in a uniform way.

  We expect that you use the types 'Int8', 'Word8' and so on
  for monophonic samples and thus provide instances of the class for them.
  Further we define Stereo record and mu-law sample type.
  Quadrophony can be achieved by nested Stereo value,
  but I'm uncertain, whether this is a good way to go.
  Maybe we add 5+1 channels or so in future.

  This is used by packages @sox@, @alsa@, @synthesizer@.
