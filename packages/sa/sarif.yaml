  # SARIF implementation for Haskell

  This Haskell library provides types and JSON instances for the [Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF)](https://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net). Static analysis tools written in Haskell may use this library to export their results which can then be consumed by e.g. [GitHub Code Scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning).
