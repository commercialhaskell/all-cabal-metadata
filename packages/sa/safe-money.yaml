  # Version 0.9

  * _BREAKING CHANGE, POSSIBLY REQUIRING HUMAN INTERVENTION_. Changed
    `UnitScale "BSD" "cent"` from `(1, 1)` to `(100, 1)`, changed
    `UnitScale "HTG" "centime"` from `(1, 1)` to `(100, 1)`, changed
    `UnitScale "MDL" "leu"` from `(100, 1)` to `(1, 1)`, and changed
    `UnitScale "SBD" "dollar"` from `(100, 1)` to `(1, 1)`.  The scales in
    question were wrong before. If you relied on these specific scales,
    for example, for serializing and storing amounts in a database, you
    will need to rescale your amounts.

  # Version 0.8.1

  * Fix decimal rendering of some small cent values (e.g., `0.02`). See issue #45.

  * Fixed `xxxToDecimal` docs. See issue #45.

  * Add `someXxxToDecimal`. See issue #44.


  # Version 0.8

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. Introduced `DecimalConf`, which all
    of the `xxxToDecimal` and `xxxFromDecimal` are now using. This concentrates
    all decimal rendering and parsing settings in a single place, and more
    importantly, it makes all of the `xxxToDecimal` return a `Text` value
    directly, rather than a `Maybe Text`. In turn, `Separators` has been
    introduced for configuring decimal and thousands separators. See issue #30.

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. The `Scale` type family was renamed to
    `UnitScale`.

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. Previous instances of the `Scale` type
    family where the `currency` and the `unit` were the same (e.g., `Scale "USD"
    "USD"`), intended to convey a canonical scale for the currency, are now
    written as `CurrencyScale currency` (e.g., `CurrencyScale "USD"`).

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. A new datatype called `Scale` has been
    introduced. This datatype replaces term-level uses of `Rational` to convey the
    scale of a discrete monetary amount. The rationale for this, beyond improved
    type errors, is that checking for the scale's validity can be done at a single
    place (namely, the new `scaleFromRational`), rather than everywhere a
    term-level scale was expected as input. See issue #43.

  * Added new approximation method `HalfEven`, also known as “Bankers rounding”.
    See issue #42.

  * New currencies: VES (see issue #33), UYW.


  # Version 0.7.1

  * Fixed compilation with GHC 8.6.

  * Fixed an issue when rendering decimal values smaller than the smallest
    possible fractional part. See issue #39.


  # Version 0.7

  * _IMPORTANT_. All of the changes in this release are fully backwards
    compatible. What happens in this release is that many instances
    previously exported by `safe-money` now live in different libraries so
    that downstream packages can avoid using Cabal flags to specify
    dependencies.

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. `FromJSON` and `ToJSON` (from
    `aeson`) instances are not exported from the `safe-money` library
    anymore. Instead, you are now expected to depend on the vetted
    `safe-money-aeson` library and import `Money.Aeson` to get the
    relevant instances. These instances are exactly the same ones
    previously exported by `safe-money`. As a consequence of this change,
    the `aeson` Cabal flag in `safe-money` and the optional dependency on
    `aeson` were removed, which simplifies downstream packaging.

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. `Store` (from `store`) instances
    are not exported from the `safe-money` library anymore. Instead, you
    are now expected to depend on the vetted `safe-money-store` library
    and import `Money.Store` to get the relevant instances. These
    instances are exactly the same ones previously exported by
    `safe-money`. As a consequence of this change, the `store` Cabal flag
    in `safe-money` and the optional dependency on `serialise` were
    removed, which simplifies downstream packaging.

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. `Serialise` (from `serialise`)
    instances are not exported from the `safe-money` library anymore.
    Instead, you are now expected to depend on the vetted
    `safe-money-serialise` library and import `Money.Serialise` to get the
    relevant instances. These instances are exactly the same ones
    previously exported by `safe-money`. As a consequence of this change,
    the `serialise` Cabal flag in `safe-money` and the optional dependency
    on `serialise` were removed, which simplifies downstream packaging.

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. `Serialize` (from `cereal`)
    instances are not exported from the `safe-money` library anymore.
    Instead, you are now expected to depend on the vetted
    `safe-money-cereal` library and import `Money.Serialize` to get the
    relevant instances. These instances are exactly the same ones
    previously exported by `safe-money`. As a consequence of this change,
    the `cereal` Cabal flag in `safe-money` and the optional dependency on
    `cereal` were removed, which simplifies downstream packaging.

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. `FromXml` and `ToXml` (from
    `xmlbf`) instances are not exported from the `safe-money` library
    anymore. Instead, you are now expected to depend on the vetted
    `safe-money-xmlbf` library and import `Money.Aeson` to get the
    relevant instances. These instances are exactly the same ones
    previously exported by `safe-money`. As a consequence of this change,
    the `xmlbf` Cabal flag in `safe-money` and the optional dependency on
    `xmlbf` were removed, which simplifies downstream packaging.

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. `hashable` and `vector-space` are
    now mandatory dependencies of `safe-money`. `Hashable`, `VectorSpace`
    and `AdditiveGroup` instances for the various `safe-money` datatypes
    are now exported from `Money`. The `hashable` and `vector-space` Cabal
    flags are now gone.

  * `Arbitrary` instances (from the `QuickCheck` packages) for the various
    `safe-money` datatypes are now exported from `Money`. `QuickCheck` is
    now a mandatory dependency of `safe-money`.


  # Version 0.6

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. `denseToDecimal` now takes a positive
    `Rational` rather than a `Proxy scale`.

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. `denseFromDecimal` and
    `discreteFromDecimal` now take a positive `Rational` scale, like their
    `xxxToDecimal` counterparts.

  * _COMPILE ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. `binary`, `deepseq` and `text` are now
    mandatory dependencies since they are included with the standard GHC
    distribution. Thus, the tags for disabling them have been removed.

  * _COMPILE ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. `Text` replaced the use of `String` in the
    public API. For example, `denseCurrency` now returns `Text`, instead of
    `String`. This change doesn't break backwards compatibilility with binary
    serializations.

  * Introduced a new function `discreteToDecimal`.

  * Added tests to ensure backwards compatibility of serializations.


  # Version 0.5

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. The `round`, `floor`, `ceiling` and
    `truncate` functions were replaced by a single `discreteFromDense` function
    taking an argument of type `Approximation` (`Round`, `Floor`, `Ceiling` or
    `Truncate`) as an argument.

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. The `fromDiscrete` function was
    renamed to `denseFromDiscrete`.

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. The `fromExchangeRate` function was
    renamed to `exchangeRateToRational`.

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. The `flipExchangeRate` function was
    renamed to `exchangeRateRecip`.

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. The `Dense` is not an instance of
    `Fractional` anymore because `recip` and `/` could potentially crash.

  * Introduced new functions for rendering and parsing decimal reperesentations
    of monetary amounts: `denseCurrency`, `discreteCurrency`, `denseFromDecimal`,
    `denseToDecimal`, `discreteFromDecimal`, `exchangeRateFromDecimal`,
    `exchangeRateToDecimal`.

  * Introduced optional `AdditiveGroup` and `VectorSpace` group instances for
    `Dense` and `Discrete`. These type-classes come from the `vector-space`
    library and they can be enabled or disabled via the `vector-space` Cabal flag,
    which is enabled by default.

  * Introduced `discrete` constructor which behaves just like `fromInteger`.

  * Introduced the `dense'` constructor as an unsafe but convenient version of
    `dense`.

  * The `ErrScaleNonCanonical` type is now exported.

  * The `Money.Internal` module is now exposed, but hidden from the Haddock
    documentation.

  * New scale: `"BTC" "millibitcoin"`.

  * Added many tests.


  # Version 0.4.1

  * `ExchangeRate` is now a `Category`.


  # Version 0.4

  * **BREAKING CHANGE REQUIRING HUMAN INTERVENTION**. The JSON serializations for
    all of `Dense`, `SomeDense`, `Discrete`, `SomeDiscrete`, `ExchangeRate` and
    `SomeExchangeRate` changed. The `FromJSON` instances are backwards compatible
    with the old serializations, but the `ToJSON` instances will only generate the
    new format, which is the same as the old format except the leading strings
    `"Dense"`, `"Discrete"` and `"ExchangeRate"`, respectively, are not present in
    the rendered JSON array anymore. So, if you were manually relying on the
    `ToJSON` instance, please update your code.

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. Changed the `Rep` suffix for a `Some`
    prefix Everywhere.  For example, `DenseRep` was renamed to `SomeDense`.

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. Replaced the
    `someDenseAmountNumerator` and `someDenseAmountDenominator` `Integers` with a
    single `someDenseAmount` `Rational` number. Similarly for `someDiscreteScale`
    and `someExchangeRateRate`. The `mkSomeDense`, `someDiscreteScale` and
    `mkSomeDense` also take a `Rational` now.

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. The `truncate`, `floor`, `celing` and
    `round` functions now return just `0` as a reminder if there's no significant
    reminder, instead of `Nothing`.

  * Added instances for `serialise`.

  * Added instances for `xmlbf`.

  * Fixed `Show` instances so that surrounding parentheses are included when
    necessary.

  * New currencies: Ripple, Litecoin, Ada, Monero.


  # Version 0.3

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. The `Data.Money` module was renamed to
    `Money`.

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. The `Data.Money.Internal` module is not
    exposed anymore. All of its contents are now exported from the `Money` module.

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. Renamed `discreteRep` to
    `toDiscreteRep`.

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. Renamed `denseRep` to `toDenseRep`.

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. Renamed `exchangeRateRep` to
    `toExchangeRateRep`.

  * _COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE_. Renamed Iceleandic currency `"eyir"` to
    `"eyrir"`

  * Remove upper bound constraints from all dependencies except `base`.

  * Made dependency on `store` optional for the test suite, so that it can run on
    GHCJS.


  # Version 0.2

  * Cabal flags are now manual (`aeson`, `binary`, `bytes`, `cereal`, `deepseq`,
    `hashable`).

  * Backwards compatibility with GHC 7.10.

  * Fix `Store` instances and test them.


  # Version 0.1

  * Initial release.
