changelog: ! "# Version 0.4.1\n\n* `ExchangeRate` is now a `Category`.\n\n\n# Version
  0.4\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE. COMPILER WON'T COMPLAIN. HUMAN INTERVENTION POTENTIALLY\n
  \ REQUIRED. The JSON serializations for all of `Dense`, `SomeDense`, `Discrete`,\n
  \ `SomeDiscrete`, `ExchangeRate` and `SomeExchangeRate` changed. The `FromJSON`\n
  \ instances are backwards compatible with the old serializations, but the\n  `ToJSON`
  instances will only generate the new format, which is the same as the\n  old format
  except the leading strings `\"Dense\"`, `\"Discrete\"` and\n  `\"ExchangeRate\"`,
  respectively, are not present in the rendered JSON array\n  anymore. So, if you
  were manually relying on the `ToJSON` instance, please\n  update your code.\n\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE. COMPILER WILL COMPLAIN: Changed the `Rep` suffix for a `Some`\n
  \ prefix Everywhere.  For example, `DenseRep` was renamed to `SomeDense`.\n\n* BREAKING
  CHANGE. COMPILER WILL COMPLAIN: Replaced the\n  `someDenseAmountNumerator` and `someDenseAmountDenominator`
  `Integers` with a\n  single `someDenseAmount` `Rational` number. Similarly for `someDiscreteScale`\n
  \ and `someExchangeRateRate`. The `mkSomeDense`, `someDiscreteScale` and\n  `mkSomeDense`
  also take a `Rational` now.\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE. COMPILER WILL COMPLAIN: The `truncate`,
  `floor`, `celing` and\n  `round` functions now return just `0` as a reminder if
  there's no significant\n  reminder, instead of `Nothing`.\n\n* Added instances for
  `serialise`.\n\n* Added instances for `xmlbf`.\n\n* Fixed `Show` instances so that
  surrounding parentheses are included when\n  necessary.\n\n* New currencies: Ripple,
  Litecoin, Ada, Monero.\n\n\n# Version 0.3\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: The `Data.Money`
  module was renamed to `Money`.\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: The `Data.Money.Internal` module
  is not exposed anymore. All\n  of its contents are now exported from the `Money`
  module.\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Renamed `discreteRep` to `toDiscreteRep`.\n\n* BREAKING
  CHANGE: Renamed `denseRep` to `toDenseRep`.\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Renamed `exchangeRateRep`
  to `toExchangeRateRep`.\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Renamed Iceleandic currency `\"eyir\"`
  to `\"eyrir\"`\n\n* Remove upper bound constraints from all dependencies except
  `base`.\n\n* Made dependency on `store` optional for the test suite, so that it
  can run on\n  GHCJS.\n\n\n# Version 0.2\n\n* Cabal flags are now manual (`aeson`,
  `binary`, `bytes`, `cereal`, `deepseq`,\n  `hashable`).\n\n* Backwards compatibility
  with GHC 7.10.\n\n* Fix `Store` instances and test them.\n\n\n# Version 0.1\n\n*
  Initial release.\n"
