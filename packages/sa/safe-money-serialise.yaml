description: |
  This library exports `Serialise` instances (from the `serialise`
  library) for many of the types exported by the `safe-money` library.

  Note: The code in this library used to be part of the `safe-money`
  library itself, so these instances are intended to be backwards
  compatible with older versions of `safe-money`.
