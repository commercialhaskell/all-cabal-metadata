  This library allows you to load plugins, just as hs-plugins do.
  But under some circumstances, you do not want to allow
  plugins to do everything they want. What about plugin
  which executes `rm -rf /*' ? In Haskell, you can limit
  plugin's abilities just by not allowing it to import `not
  safe' modules (System.IO.Unsafe, etc). With this library,
  you specify a list of modules that plugin should be forced
  to import (i.e., some plugin API module), and a list of
  module that you want to allow plugin to import (some
  `surely safe' modules). Plugin cannot import any other
  modules. Moreover, you can specify some language
  extensions, for example, NoImplicitPrelude.
