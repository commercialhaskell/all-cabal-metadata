  This programs shows how to use HaskellNet to download email from imap SSL servers.
  The IMAP implementation is provided by HaskellNet, and the SSL implementation is
  provided by HsOpenSSL. The program uses HsOpenSSL to forward a tcp connection on
  a local port to a remote imap server and wraps the connection over SSL. HaskellNet
  simply connects to the local port.

  Currently imapget is able to list imap folders and print downloaded messages
  in the standard output.

  When run the first time, it will create a configuration file which you can edit
  to specify username, password, imap server and ports.

  > hostname=imap.gmail.com
  > port=993
  > username=<your imap username>
  > passwd=<your imap password>
  > ssl_wrap_port=3004

  ssl_wrap_port is the local port used to wrap IMAP traffic over SSL.
