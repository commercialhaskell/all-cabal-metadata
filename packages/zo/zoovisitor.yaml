  ZooVisitor
  ==========

  An Apache [zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) client for Haskell.

  Tested on zookeeper 3.4, a higher version should work but not guaranteed.

  **NOTE: this library is still in development.**


  ## Features

  - Simple
    + Does not require knowledge of the C APIs
    + Does not require malloc and free memory manually
    + High-level api written in Haskell

  - Safe
    + Type safe
    + A failure action should throw an exception

  - Fast
    + All underlying calls are non-blocking, you can use Haskell lightweight threads to speed up your tasks.
    + The speed should be compatible to C implementation
