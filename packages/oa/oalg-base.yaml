description: |-
  Basic definition of algebraic structures, viewing through the lens of categories.

  - Most algebraic operations, e.g. multiplication, addition etc, are partially defined operators,
  but have precise definition for there applicability.

  - Limits serve as a backbone for solving algebraic problems, e. g. finding all solutions of the
  equation a * x == 0 is given by the kernel of a.

  The actual release contains a minimum of functionality to define finitely generated abelian groups
  and the kernels and cokernels respectively. As such, a lot of more work has to be done to get a
  complete base for solving algebraic problems.

  To Do:

  - Property for Generator more precise.

  - Exact sequences.

  - Kernel and cokernels for matrices over a field.

  - As Double is not implemented as an algebraic structure here (it dose not comply to the stated
  properties),it is not so obvious how to handle reals.

  - More statements for validation.
