  /Warning/: This software is pre 1.0 and thus its API may change very
  dynamically while updating only minor versions. This package will follow the
  PVP once it reaches version 1.0.

  OAuth is a popular protocol allowing servers to offer resources owned by some
  user to a series of authorized clients securely. For instance, OAuth lets
  Twitter provide access to a user's private tweets to the Twitter client
  registered on their phone.

  @oauthenticated@ is a Haskell library implementing OAuth protocols atop the
  minimalistic @http-client@ HTTP client library extracted from @http-conduit@.
  "Network.OAuth" offers simple functions for signing
  'Network.HTTP.Client.Request's along with tools for 'Network.OAuth.Cred'ential
  management and 'Network.OAuth.Server' configuration. "Network.OAuth.Simple"
  provides a slightly more heavy-weight interface which manages the necessary state
  and configuration using a monad transformer stack.

  There's also an implementation of OAuth's three-legged credential acquisition
  protocol built atop the "Network.OAuth" API. This can be handled in both
  conformant and old-style modes: conformant will reject server responses which
  are not conformant with RFC 5849 (which builds atop community version OAuth
  1.0a) while old-style better allows for less-than-compliant servers. See
  'Network.OAuth.Types.Params.Version' for more details.

  Currently @oauthenticated@ only supports OAuth 1.0 and is in alpha. OAuth 2.0
  support is a potential goal, but it's unclear if it can be transparently
  supported at a similar level of abstraction.
