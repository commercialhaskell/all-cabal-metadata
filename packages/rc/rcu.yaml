changelog: |+
  ## 0.2.4 [2019.05.02]
  ---------------------
  * Support building with `base-4.13` (GHC 8.8).

  ## 0.2.3 [2018.08.01]
  ---------------------
  * Add `MonadFail` instances for `ReadingRCU` and `WritingRCU`.

  ## 0.2.2 [2018.02.06]
  ---------------------
  * Include `HLint.hs` with the tarball distribution, fixing the `hlint`
    test suite.

  ## 0.2.1
  --------
  * Support `doctest-0.12`

  ## 0.2
  ------
  * Revamp `Setup.hs` to use `cabal-doctest`. This makes it build
    with `Cabal-2.0`, and makes the `doctest`s work with `cabal new-build` and
    sandboxes.

  ## rcu

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/rcu.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rcu) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ekmett/rcu.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ekmett/rcu)

  This package is an exploration of Read-Copy Update in Haskell based on [Relativistic Programming in Haskell](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~theod/papers/haskell2015.pdf) by Cooper and Walpole.  It includes a sound QSBR-based implementation and an attempt at an STM-based implementation.

  In the spirit of [A Relativistic Enhancement to Software Transactional Memory](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/hotpar11/tech/final_files/Howard.pdf)
   by Howard and Walpole, we could extend the STM implementation to allow reads and writes on the same data in parallel, writes to disjoint data in parallel, and force readers to agree that writes before a `synchronize` happened before writes after it.

  Development on this project proceeded in a burst of enthusiasm after Edward saw Ted's poster presentation at ICFP 2015, and yet somehow he managed to shanghai Ted into helping maintain this copy of his own work.
