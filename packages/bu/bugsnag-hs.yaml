  # bugsnag-hs

  A [Bugsnag][] client for Haskell. Bugsnag is an application monitoring and error reporting tool. This library provides an API for sending reports to the [Bugsnag error reporting API][].

  The library is low-level and provides a faithful representation of version 5 of the [Bugsnag error reporting API][] payload. Almost all documentation comments in this code come from that API's documentation. The intent is for this library to make no assumptions about the structure of the application using it.
