description: |-
  "Data.BufferBuilder" is an efficient library for incrementally building
  up 'ByteString's, one chunk at a time.  Early benchmarks show it
  is over twice as fast as ByteString Builder, primarily because
  'BufferBuilder' is built upon an ST-style restricted monad and
  mutable state instead of ByteString Builder's monoidal AST.

  Internally, BufferBuilder is backed by a few C functions.
  Examination of GHC's output shows nearly optimal code generation
  with no intermediate thunks -- and thus, continuation passing and
  its associated indirect jumps and stack traffic only occur when
  BufferBuilder is asked to append a non-strict ByteString.

  I benchmarked four approaches with a URL encoding benchmark:

  * State monad, concatenating ByteStrings: 6.98 us

  * State monad, ByteString Builder: 2.48 us

  * Crazy explicit RealWorld baton passing with unboxed state: 28.94 us (GHC generated really awful code for this, but see the revision history for the technique)

  * C + FFI + ReaderT: 1.11 us

  Using BufferBuilder is very simple:

  > import qualified Data.BufferBuilder as BB
  >
  > let byteString = BB.runBufferBuilder $ do
  >       BB.appendBS "http"
  >       BB.appendChar8 '/'
  >       BB.appendBS "//"

  This package also provides "Data.BufferBuilder.Utf8" for generating UTF-8 buffers
  and "Data.BufferBuilder.Json" for encoding data structures into JSON.
