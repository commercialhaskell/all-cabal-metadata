  Bustle draws sequence diagrams of D-Bus activity, showing signal
  emissions, method calls and their corresponding returns, with timestamps
  for each individual event and the duration of each method call. This can
  help you check for unwanted D-Bus traffic, and pinpoint why your
  D-Bus-based application isn't performing as well as you like. It also
  provides statistics like signal frequencies and average method call
  times.

  Using Bustle
  ============

  Run it:

      bustle

  Now click **File → New…** to start recording session bus traffic. When you're
  done, click **Stop**, and explore the log.

  If you want to record traffic without running the UI (maybe on an embedded
  platform which doesn't have Gtk+ and/or a Haskell compiler), you can use the
  stand-alone logger:

      bustle-pcap logfile.bustle

  You can then open `logfile.bustle` in Bustle.

  You can also get some ASCII-art
  version of the statistics shown in the UI:

      bustle --count logfile.bustle
      bustle --time logfile.bustle
