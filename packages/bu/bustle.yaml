description: ! "Bustle draws sequence diagrams of D-Bus activity, showing signal\nemissions,
  method calls and their corresponding returns, with timestamps\nfor each individual
  event and the duration of each method call. This can\nhelp you check for unwanted
  D-Bus traffic, and pinpoint why your\nD-Bus-based application isn't performing as
  well as you like. It also\nprovides statistics like signal frequencies and average
  method call\ntimes.\n\n\nUsing Bustle\n============\n\nRun it:\n\n    bustle\n\nNow
  click **File → New…** to start recording session bus traffic. When you're\ndone,
  click **Stop**, and explore the log.\n\nIf you want to record traffic without running
  the UI (maybe on an embedded\nplatform which doesn't have Gtk+ and/or a Haskell
  compiler), you can use the\nstand-alone logger:\n\n    bustle-pcap logfile.bustle\n\nYou
  can then open `logfile.bustle` in Bustle.\n\nYou can also get some ASCII-art\nversion
  of the statistics shown in the UI:\n\n    bustle --count logfile.bustle\n    bustle
  --time logfile.bustle\n\nIf you want to log all system bus traffic, you need to
  edit\n`/etc/dbus/system.conf` to enable eavesdropping, and then remove the include
  of\n`/etc/dbus-1/system.conf.d` which seems to re-enable strictness. Then you can
  run\nthe stand-alone logger against the system bus:\n\n    bustle-pcap --system
  system-log.bustle\n\nPlease remember to **undo these changes** when you're done.\n\n\nMore
  information\n================\n\nSee <http://wjt.me.uk/bustle/>.\n"
