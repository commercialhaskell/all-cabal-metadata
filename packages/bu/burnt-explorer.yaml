description: ! '# burnt-explorer


  This unsophisticated application prints all [`OP_RETURN`](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/OP_RETURN)
  cryptocurrency transaction outputs in a given block range. Usage:


  ```

  burnt-explorer <start height> <stop height>

  ```


  It is assumed that you have `blackcoind` binary available in `$PATH`. If you want
  to use another command, set the `BLACKCOIND_COMMAND` environment variable.


  Output format is [CSV (RFC 4180)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) without header,
  with minimal double quotes usage and with the following columns:


  ```

  <block height>,<block hash>,<block time>,<transaction id>,<vout index>,<satoshis
  burnt>,<script hex>,<decoded script>

  ```


  [`bitcoin-script` package](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bitcoin-script) is
  used for decoding scripts. If you don’t have a full-fledged CSV parser, you may
  want to omit the last field, for example by piping the output through `cut -d ,
  -f -7`.


  For prebuilt binaries, see job artifacts in [CI builds](https://gitlab.com/KrzysiekJ/burnt-explorer/pipelines).
