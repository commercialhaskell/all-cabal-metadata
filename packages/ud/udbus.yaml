  hs-udbus
  ========

  The udbus haskell package provides a BSD implementation of the DBus protocol in
  pure Haskell, giving access to a simple lowlevel (Network.DBus.Actions) interface
  and a simple high level interface with a simple mainloop dispatcher (Network.DBus)

  The interfaces are coherent and basic, sacrificing some ease of use (in using
  more appropriate haskell types for dbus array for example) in favor of being
  able to write generated code easily.

  The code doesn't check if the object values (objectpath, interface, etc)
  are appropriates on sending, nor on receiving. The dbus daemon should have
  prevented invalid values to be received, and for sending, the user need to take
  extra care of the values sent.

  TODO & Caveats
  --------------

  User should always select little endian regardless of the actual machine
  architecture when creating message. However, receiving message in both
  endianness is supported.

  Double are expected to be handled as IEEE754 by the compiler. Serialization of
  double is handled in a GHC specific way (making the package GHC specific),
  expecting that any architecture represent double the IEEE754 way. So far, this
  seems to be true for every architecture supported by GHC.

  Stability
  ---------

  While the low level interfaces should remains the same, it's not unexpected that
  some high level interface would be grafted on top of the actual interfaces.

  Example
  -------

  A simple example on how to use the interfaces is available at the root of the
  package as DBus.hs
