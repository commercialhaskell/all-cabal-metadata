changelog: |
  0.3.0.0

  * Replaced the `HoistError` typeclass, which is about monads, with a
    simpler `PluckError` typeclass that is about extracting errors from
    values.
  * Removed the instance for `Except e`, as it triggers overlapping
    instance errors when attempting to hoist `ExceptT e m` for unknown
    monads `m`.
  * Introduced a parallel `Control.Monad.Fail.Hoist` module, for
    hoisting error messages into `MonadFail`.

  0.2.1.0

  * Removed unicode syntax and variables
  * Added Control.Monad.Error.Hoist.hoistErrorM (= flip (<%!?>))

  0.2.0.1

  * Import `eitherT` when using old EitherT instance.

  0.2.0.0

  * Trying to make things agreeable for removed modules (Control.Monad.Trans.Either) and new instances (Control.Monad.Except(T)).
  * Applied the stylish-haskell hammer, and may remove unicode syntax for the proper hackage release.
  * Update readme, added tested-with to cabal file to prepare for travis CI integration.
  * Added travis yaml, and tested-with to cabal.
  * Updated gitignore file.
  * Removed 7.6 from tested GHC versions, and removed a command from travis to change to a directory that doesn't exist.
  * Moved the lower bound of mtl to 2.1 to permit building using transformers 0.3 for slightly older GHC versions.
  * Added CPP to not include Except instances unless MTL is min version 2.2.2. Added generous bounds to either package.
  * Add ErrorT instance for pre-mtl-2.2.2.
  * Added concrete type examples to Haddock, ala lens examples.

  0.1.0.0

  * Actually add the code
