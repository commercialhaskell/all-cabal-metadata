  # Haskell Tools for Host Addresses

  This package implements Host addresses as described in RFC2396 section 3.2.2
  with additional consideration of

  * RFC1123 (additional restrictions for hostnames),
  * RFC1034 (disambiguate domain names and IPv4 addresses),
  * RFC4291 (parsing of IPv6 addresses), and
  * RFC3986 and RFC5952 (IPv6 literals within host addresses).

  # Build from Source

  ```sh
  cabal build
  ```

  The following optional build flags are available:

  *   `-fwith-aeson`: build `ToJSON` and `FromJSON` instance for use with
      [aeson](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson).

  *   `-fwith-configuration-tools`: build instances and functions for supporting
      the use with
      [configuration-tools](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/configuration-tools).

  *   `-fwith-quickcheck`: include function for generating arbitrary values and
      `Arbitrary` instance for use with
      [QuickCheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck).
