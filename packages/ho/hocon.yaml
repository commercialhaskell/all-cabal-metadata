  # hocon

  Small library for [Typesafe's configuration specification](https://github.com/lightbend/config) built with parsec.

  ```
  foo = bar
  bar = 123
  someObject {
      wow = "this is nice!"
  }
  ```

  While there are many configuration notations and formats around, HOCON stands in a comfortable place, albeit a bit underrated. Being a superset to JSON means it inherits its great readability, as well as extending it with some very nice features, such as comments, no need to add `"` for properties and values (unless some special character is required), digging up nested values, among others.

  ## Sounds nice, how do I use it?

  First of all, import the basic stuff:
  ```haskell
  import Data.HOCON
  import Text.Parser.HOCON
  ```

  The first module exports the tree-like structure typical of JSON (if you're familiar with `aeson`, then it's really the same structure. It's not using _that_ structure because no way I'm including that just for the structure) and the accessor functions, while the second exports the parser function:
  ```haskell
  parseHOCON :: String -> Either ParseError Config
  ```

  If you've already used Typesafe's config on the JVM, then the functions will make you feel just like at home:
  ```haskell
  getConfig :: String -> Config -> Maybe Config
  getNumber :: String -> Config -> Maybe Double
  getString :: String -> Config -> Maybe String
  getBoolean :: String -> Config -> Maybe Bool
  getList :: String -> Config -> Maybe [Config]
  hasPath :: String -> Config -> Bool
  ```

  ## Missing features / what's to come
  * Actually support comments
  * Multiline strings
  * Include another file and merge them
  * Object substitution

  Pull requests are always welcome!
