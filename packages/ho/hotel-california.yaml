  # Changelog for `hotel-california`

  All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

  The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
  and this project adheres to the
  [Haskell Package Versioning Policy](https://pvp.haskell.org/).

  ## Unreleased

  ## 0.0.6.1 - 2025-03-07

  - [#21](https://github.com/parsonsmatt/hotel-california/pull/21)
    - Add more detail to the program description

  ## 0.0.6.0 - 2024-03-28

  - [#20](https://github.com/parsonsmatt/hotel-california/pull/20/)
      - Reduce Honeycomb target initialization timeout from 3 seconds to 1 second.
      - `withGlobalTracing` now expects a callback that accepts the honeycomb target.
      - Executable bypasses OTEL operations if Honeycomb target cannot be initialized.

  ## 0.0.5.0 - 2024-02-29

  - [#19](https://github.com/parsonsmatt/hotel-california/pull/19/)
      - Record the command's exit status (`process.exit_status`) and command
        attributes.
      - This replaces the default `process.executable.name` and related attributes
        set by `hs-opentelemetry`.

  ## 0.0.4.0 - 2024-01-26

  - [#14](https://github.com/parsonsmatt/hotel-california/pull/14/)
      - Add the `--set-sigint-status` to control how `Ctrl-C` and `SIGINT` are
        reported.
  - [#16](https://github.com/parsonsmatt/hotel-california/pull/16)
      - You can now provide attributes for the span that `hotel-california`
        creates by passing the CLI argument `--attribute KEY=VALUE`. Only string
        attributes are currently supported.

  ## 0.0.3.0 - 2023-09-18

  - [#13](https://github.com/parsonsmatt/hotel-california/pull/13)
      - The `hotel` command will now propagate the `BAGGAGE` environment variable,
        according to the [W3C working draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/baggage/),
        similar how it already propagates `TRACEPARENT` and `TRACESTATE`.

  ## 0.0.2.0 - 2023-09-15

  - [#7](https://github.com/parsonsmatt/hotel-california/pull/7)
      - Fixed escaping of shell commands. Previously, single quotes would not be
        passed correctly, so a command like this:
          ```
          hotel exec -- cabal build --ghc-options='-Werror -ferror-spans'
          ```
        would get passed like `cabal ["build", "--ghc-options='-Werror'", "-ferror-spans'"]`.
        This is now fixed, and it will be properly passed as `cabal ["build", "--ghc-options='-Werror -ferrorspans'"]`.
      - CLI interface changed subtly - now, `hotel exec command [args]` will do a
        process lookup for `command`. If you want to pass a shell script, instead
        do:
          ```
          hotel exec --shell 'echo a && echo b || true'
          ```

  ## 0.0.1.0 - 2023-09-12

  - Initial Release
  - Introduce `exec` functionality

  # hotel-california

  `hotel-california` is inspired by [`Trace`](https://github.com/Pondidum/Trace/) and [`otel-cli`](https://github.com/equinix-labs/otel-cli), a pair of utilities for tracing shell scripts.
  We needed something like this in order to instrument local builds, so we could understand how much time people are spending waiting on builds, tests, etc.

  # Usage

  The binary name is `hotel`.
  Currently, the only supported command is `exec`

  ```sh
  $ hotel exec --help
  Usage: hotel exec [-s|--span-name SPAN_NAME]
                    [-i|--set-sigint-status SPAN_STATUS]
                    [-a|--attribute KEY=VALUE]...
                    (COMMAND [ARGUMENT]... | --shell SCRIPT)

    Execute the given command with tracing enabled

  Available options:
    -h,--help                Show this help text
    -s,--span-name SPAN_NAME The name of the span that the program reports. By
                             default, this is the script you pass in.
    -i,--set-sigint-status SPAN_STATUS
                             The status reported when the process is killed with
                             SIGINT.
    -a,--attribute KEY=VALUE A string attribute to add to the span.
    --shell SCRIPT           Run an arbitrary shell script instead of running an
                             executable command
  ```

  Currently, the program only looks in environment variables for configuration.

  - `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (with a default to `localhost:4317`)
  - `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`
  - `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`
  - `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`
  - and probably others, see
    [`hs-opentelemetry-sdk`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hs-opentelemetry-sdk)
    for more information

  # Background/FAQ

  ## Lol what's up with the name

  Well `otel-cli` is a great name for the tool.
  But this is a Haskell implementation, so I need an `h` in there somewhere.
  `hotel-cli` sounds good.
  But wait... `cli` ... what else could I do with that?
  Ahah!

  Sorry

  ## Difference from `Trace`

  The `Trace` tool has the following basic workflow:

  ```sh
  $ TRACE_PARENT=$(trace start "build")
  $ make build
  $ trace finish
  ```

  When you call `trace start "trace-name"`, it generates a `TraceId` and `SpanId` and records that to a file in the temporary directory.
  The filename carries the trace ID and span ID.
  The file contains the name of the trace, the start time, and any other metadata you provide.

  When you call `trace finish`, the tool looks for the `TRACE_PARENT` environment variable.
  It then looks in the `$TMP/traces/state` directory for a file that matches the `TRACE_PARENT`.
  It loads the file, creates a `Span` with the timestamp given in the file, and then calls `span.End`.
  The tool then makes a network request to report this data.

  ### The Problems

  #### Performance

  The tool allows you to start groups and run commands that will make individual spans, allowing you to understand the overall trace.
  `trace group start` is similar to `trace start` - it creates a new Span ID, attaches it to the parent span, and writes that to the temporary directory.
  `trace task` does something a bit more idiomatic - it creates a `Span`, runs the command you provide, and then does `Span.end`.
  `trace group finish` is similar to `trace finish` - it loads the parent span information for the group, creates a `Span`, and calls `span.End` with the timestamps loaded from the group.

  The toy example I did is here:

  ```sh
  $ TRACE_PARENT=$(trace start "why"); \
    GROUP=$(trace group start "why-1"); \
    trace task "$GROUP" -- go build; \
    trace group finish "$GROUP"; \
    trace finish
  ```

  According to Honeycomb, this spends 170ms doing `go build`, and then incurs another 650ms to complete the entire process - the `why-1` group takes roughly 370ms extra, and then the final `trace finish` call adds another 300ms.

  This performance hit may not be substantial for the apparent intention of the tool - instrumenting CI builds - but it is going to be a problem for *my* intention with the tool - instrumenting local developer workflows.
  300ms is significant, but not terrible if incurred once.
  However, incurring that for each step we want to record?
  That's a problem.

  The out-of-the-box solution is to use an OpenTelemetry collector that is local to the machine, and can report the spans periodically, in the background.
  This is an extra deployment step, so it'd be nice to avoid that, if possible.

  #### Nesting

  The API requires you to work in this manner:

  ```sh
  $ TRACE_PARENT=$(trace start "my-trace")
  $ OUTER_GROUP=$(trace group start "neat")
  $ INNER_GROUP=$(trace group start "neat" "$OUTER_GROUP")
  $ trace task "$INNER_GROUP" -- make build
  $ trace group finish "$INNER_GROUP"
  $ trace group finish "$OUTER_GROUP"
  $ trace finish
  ```

  So any time you do `trace start`, you create an identifier for a parent span.
  But any time you do `trace group finish`, you look up the relevant parent span
  ID and then actually *create* a *child span*.

  This makes it difficult to create a span, and just "know" if you're in a root or not.
  You would need this in order to provide a composable interface: shell scripts calling other shell scripts which can all record spans.

  ## Difference from `otel-cli`

  Well, `otel-cli` solves most of the above problems.
  The main entry point is `otel-cli exec`, which runs a command for you, and reports a span for it.
  You can nest `otel-cli exec` calls arbitrarily, which works nicely.
  However, it too had some issues, with the most challenging being a bug around signals.
  I simply couldn't figure out the behavior around signals in Golang, and all available internet advice wasn't exactly helpful.
  I decided then to spike out this tool.
