  # Hoogle [![Hackage version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/hoogle.svg?label=Hackage)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hoogle) [![Stackage version](https://www.stackage.org/package/hoogle/badge/nightly?label=Stackage)](https://www.stackage.org/package/hoogle) [![Linux build status](https://img.shields.io/travis/ndmitchell/hoogle/master.svg?label=Linux%20build)](https://travis-ci.org/ndmitchell/hoogle) [![Windows build status](https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/ndmitchell/hoogle/master.svg?label=Windows%20build)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ndmitchell/hoogle)

  ## Hoogle 4 vs Hoogle 5

  Hoogle is in the middle of a transition from version 4 to version 5.

  Hoogle 4 is at https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/. It searches the [Haskell platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/contents.html) as-of 2013. It has good type search.

  Hoogle 5 is at https://hoogle.haskell.org/ and on Hackage, so will be obtained by `cabal install hoogle`. It searches [Stackage](https://www.stackage.org/) and is updated daily. It has weaker type search, with various tickets to improve that.

  ## Other stuff (somewhat outdated)


  ----------

  **This page describes how Hoogle 5 might work, and has not yet been fully implemented.**

  ----------

  Hoogle is a Haskell API search engine, which allows you to search many standard Haskell libraries by either function name, or by approximate type signature. To experiment, visit the online version at http://haskell.org/hoogle.

  * **Online version:** https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/
  * **Hackage page:** https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hoogle
  * **Source code:** http://github.com/ndmitchell/hoogle
  * **Bug tracker:** https://github.com/ndmitchell/hoogle/issues

  ## Hoogle Use

  Hoogle can be used in several ways:

  * **Online**, with the web interface at http://haskell.org/hoogle
  * **In [IRC](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell_IRC_channel)**, using the [Lambdabot](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Lambdabot) plugin with `@hoogle` and `@hoogle+`
  * **From `emacs`**, by means of [`engine-mode`](https://github.com/hrs/engine-mode)
  * **[Installed locally](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hoogle/blob/master/docs/Install.md)**, with either a command line or in a browser
  * **[As a developer](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hoogle/blob/master/docs/API.md)**, through Haskell or JSON APIs.

  # Searches

  ## Searching

  Here are some example searches:

  * `map` searches as text, finding `map`, `concatMap`, `mapM`
  * `con map` searches for the text "map" and "con" finding `concatMap`, but not `map`
  * `a -> a` searches by type, finding `id :: a -> a`
  * `a` searches for the text "a"
  * `:: a` searches for the type "a"
  * `id :: a -> a` searches for the text "id" and the type "a -> a"


  ## Scope

  By default, searches look at the [Haskell Platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform) and [Haskell keywords](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Keywords). However, all [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org) packages are available to search. As some examples:

  * `mode +cmdargs` searches only the "cmdargs" package
  * `file -base` searches the Haskell Platform, excluding the "base" package
  * `mode +platform +cmdargs` searches both the Haskell Platform and the "cmdargs" package
  * `count +missingh` searches only the "MissingH" package - all packages are written in lower-case

  With the set of packages you are searching, you can also restrict the set of modules searched:

  * `file -System` excludes results from modules such as `System.IO`, `System.FilePath.Windows` and `Distribution.System`
  * `fold +Data.Map` finds results in the `Data.Map` module


  # Integration

  ## Command Line Version

  To invoke Hoogle type:

      hoogle "[a] -> [b]"

  Note the quotes, otherwise you will redirect the output to the file [b].

  To ensure you have data files for the Hackage modules, you will first need to
  type:

      hoogle generate

  Which will download and build Hoogle databases.

  ## Command Line UI

  There is a terminal/curses based UI available through [`cabal install bhoogle`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bhoogle).

  ## Chrome Integration

  **As a keyword search:** With a keyword search you can type `h map` directly into the location bar to perform a Hoogle search. Go to the [Hoogle website](http://haskell.org/hoogle/) in Chrome, right-click in the Hoogle search field and select "Add as a search engine...". Give it a keyword such as "h".


  ## Firefox Integration

  **From the search bar:** Go to the [Hoogle website](http://haskell.org/hoogle/) in Firefox and click on the drop-down arrow at the left of the search bar, and select the "Add Hoogle" option. Click the arrow again to select Hoogle as your search engine.

  **As a keyword search:** With a keyword search you can type `h map` directly into the location bar to perform a Hoogle search. Go to the [Hoogle website](http://haskell.org/hoogle/) in Firefox, right-click in the Hoogle search field and select "Add a Keyword for this Search...". Given it a keyword such as "h".

  If you want to search for special symbols in Firefox keyword search, modify the keyword search URL to be: `javascript:window.location.href="http://haskell.org/hoogle?q=" + encodeURIComponent("%s")`


  ## Firefox Ubiquity Integration

  [Ubiquity](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity) provides a graphical command-line for Firefox. To install the Ubiquity Hoogle command, visit the [this page](http://www.randomhacks.net/git/ubiquity/hoogle/) and click "Subscribe..." when asked whether you want to install it. Further information is available [here](http://www.randomhacks.net/articles/2008/09/01/ubiquitous-hoogle).

  ### The Source Code

  <tt>$ darcs get http://code.haskell.org/hoogle/</tt>

  Contributions are most welcome. Hoogle is written in Haskell 98 + Heirarchical Modules, I do not wish to change this. Other than that, I'm pretty flexible about most aspects of Hoogle. The [http://code.google.com/p/ndmitchell/issues/list bug tracker] has many outstanding tasks, but please contact me if you have thoughts on doing something major to Hoogle, so I can give some advice.



  # Background

  Hoogle work is licensed under the [BSD-3-Clause license](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hoogle/blob/master/docs/LICENSE).

  ## Theoretical Foundations

  A lot of related work was done by Rittri [1] and Runciman [2] in the late 80's. Since then Di Cosmo [3] has produced a book on type isomorphisms. Unfortunately the implementations that accompanied the earlier works were for functional languages that have since become less popular.

  2. [Colin Runciman and Ian Toyn, Retrieving reusable software components by polymorphic type](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=99383). Journal of Functional Programming 1 (2): 191-211, April 1991.

  I have given several presentations on type searching all available from [my home page](http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/hoogle).

  ## Folders

  The folders in the distribution, and their meaning are:

  data - tools to generate a hoogle data file

  docs - documentation on hoogle

  misc - presentations, icons, emacs scripts, logos

  src  - source code

  web  - additional resources for the web front end (css, jpg etc.)

  ## Similar Tools

  I was unaware of any similar tools before starting development, and no other tool has really influenced this tool (except the first on this list). Some related tools are:

  * [Google](http://www.google.com/), the leader in online search
  * [Hayoo](http://holumbus.fh-wedel.de/hayoo/hayoo.html), similar to Hoogle, but with less focus on type search
  * [Krugle](http://www.krugle.com/), search code, but no Haskell :(
  * [Cloogle](https://cloogle.org), for the [Clean](http://clean.cs.ru.nl) language


  ## Acknowledgements

  All code is all &copy; [Neil Mitchell](http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/), 2004-present. The initial version was done over my summer holiday, and further work was done during my PhD. During Summer 2008 I was funded to full-time on Hoogle by [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/) with the [haskell.org](http://haskell.org/) mentoring organisation. Since then I have been working on Hoogle in my spare time. Various people have given lots of useful ideas, including my PhD supervisor [Colin Runciman](http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/~colin/), and various members of the [Plasma group](http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/plasma/). In addition, the following people have also contributed code or significant debugging work:

  In previous versions, all the data was taken from [Zvon's Haskell Guide](http://www.zvon.org/other/haskell/Outputglobal/). Thanks to their open and friendly policy of allowing the data to be reused, this project became possible. More recent versions use the Hierarchical Libraries as distributed with GHC, and databases generated by Haddock.
