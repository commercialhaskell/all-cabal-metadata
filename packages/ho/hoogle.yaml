  [![Stackage version](https://www.stackage.org/package/hoogle/badge/lts?label=Stackage)](https://www.stackage.org/package/hoogle)
  [![Linux Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/ndmitchell/hoogle.svg?label=Linux%20build)](https://travis-ci.org/ndmitchell/hoogle)
  [![Windows Build Status](https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/ndmitchell/hoogle.svg?label=Windows%20build)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ndmitchell/hoogle)\n\nThe
  development branch for Hoogle version 5. The current released version lives on the
  `hoogle4` branch. For details of the current state and future direction see [this
  blog post](http://neilmitchell.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/hoogle-5-is-coming.html).\n\n----------\n\n**This
  page describes how Hoogle 5 might work, and has not yet been fully implemented.**
  \n\n----------\n\nHoogle is a Haskell API search engine, which allows you to search
  many standard Haskell libraries by either function name, or by approximate type
  signature. To experiment, visit the online version at http://haskell.org/hoogle.\n\n*
  **Online version:** https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/\n* **Hackage page:** https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hoogle\n*
  **Source code:** http://github.com/ndmitchell/hoogle\n* **Bug tracker:** https://github.com/ndmitchell/hoogle/issues\n\n##
  Hoogle Use\n\nHoogle can be used in several ways:\n\n* **Online**, with the web
  interface at http://haskell.org/hoogle\n* **In [IRC](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell_IRC_channel)**,
  using the [Lambdabot](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Lambdabot) plugin with `@hoogle`
  and `@hoogle+`\n* **From `emacs`**, by means of [`engine-mode`](https://github.com/hrs/engine-mode)\n*
  **[Installed locally](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hoogle/blob/master/docs/Install.md)**,
  with either a command line or in a browser\n* **[As a developer](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hoogle/blob/master/docs/API.md)**,
  through Haskell or JSON APIs.\n\n# Searches\n\n## Searching\n\nHere are some example
  searches:\n\n* `map` searches as text, finding `map`, `concatMap`, `mapM`\n* `con
  map` searches for the text \"map\" and \"con\" finding `concatMap`, but not `map`\n*
  `a -> a` searches by type, finding `id :: a -> a`\n* `a` searches for the text \"a\"\n*
  `:: a` searches for the type \"a\"\n* `id :: a -> a` searches for the text \"id\"
  and the type \"a -> a\"\n\n\n## Scope\n\nBy default, searches look at the [Haskell
  Platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform) and [Haskell keywords](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Keywords).
  However, all [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org) packages are available to search.
  As some examples:\n\n* `mode +cmdargs` searches only the \"cmdargs\" package\n*
  `file -base` searches the Haskell Platform, excluding the \"base\" package\n* `mode
  +platform +cmdargs` searches both the Haskell Platform and the \"cmdargs\" package\n*
  `count +missingh` searches only the \"MissingH\" package - all packages are written
  in lower-case\n\nWith the set of packages you are searching, you can also restrict
  the set of modules searched:\n\n* `file -System` excludes results from modules such
  as `System.IO`, `System.FilePath.Windows` and `Distribution.System`\n* `fold +Data.Map`
  finds results in the `Data.Map` module\n\n\n# Integration\n\n## Command Line Version\n\nTo
  invoke Hoogle type:\n\n    hoogle \"[a] -> [b]\"\n\nNote the quotes, otherwise you
  will redirect the output to the file [b].\n\nTo ensure you have data files for the
  Hackage modules, you will first need to\ntype:\n\n    hoogle generate\n\nWhich will
  download and build Hoogle databases.\n\n## Command Line UI\n\nThere is a terminal/curses
  based UI available through [`cabal install bhoogle`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bhoogle).\n\n##
  Chrome Integration\n\n**As a keyword search:** With a keyword search you can type
  `h map` directly into the location bar to perform a Hoogle search. Go to the [Hoogle
  website](http://haskell.org/hoogle/) in Chrome, right-click in the Hoogle search
  field and select \"Add as a search engine...\". Give it a keyword such as \"h\".\n\n\n##
  Firefox Integration\n\n**From the search bar:** Go to the [Hoogle website](http://haskell.org/hoogle/)
  in Firefox and click on the drop-down arrow at the left of the search bar, and select
  the \"Add Hoogle\" option. Click the arrow again to select Hoogle as your search
  engine.\n\n**As a keyword search:** With a keyword search you can type `h map` directly
  into the location bar to perform a Hoogle search. Go to the [Hoogle website](http://haskell.org/hoogle/)
  in Firefox, right-click in the Hoogle search field and select \"Add a Keyword for
  this Search...\". Given it a keyword such as \"h\".\n\nIf you want to search for
  special symbols in Firefox keyword search, modify the keyword search URL to be:
  `javascript:window.location.href=\"http://haskell.org/hoogle?q=\" + encodeURIComponent(\"%s\")`\n\n\n##
  Firefox Ubiquity Integration\n\n[Ubiquity](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity)
  provides a graphical command-line for Firefox. To install the Ubiquity Hoogle command,
  visit the [this page](http://www.randomhacks.net/git/ubiquity/hoogle/) and click
  \"Subscribe...\" when asked whether you want to install it. Further information
  is available [here](http://www.randomhacks.net/articles/2008/09/01/ubiquitous-hoogle).\n\n\n###
  The Source Code\n\n<tt>$ darcs get http://code.haskell.org/hoogle/</tt>\n\nContributions
  are most welcome. Hoogle is written in Haskell 98 + Heirarchical Modules, I do not
  wish to change this. Other than that, I'm pretty flexible about most aspects of
  Hoogle. The [http://code.google.com/p/ndmitchell/issues/list bug tracker] has many
  outstanding tasks, but please contact me if you have thoughts on doing something
  major to Hoogle, so I can give some advice.\n\n\n\n# Background\n\nHoogle work is
  licensed under the [GPL version 2.0](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hoogle/blob/master/docs/LICENSE).
  Any patches are assumed to be dual licensed under the BSD license and the GPL, to
  allow re-licensing Hoogle under the BSD license in future, if that proves beneficial
  to the Haskell community. The work is intended to be helpful, open and free. If
  the license doesn't meet your needs then talk to me.\n\n## Theoretical Foundations\n\nA
  lot of related work was done by Rittri [1] and Runciman [2] in the late 80's. Since
  then Di Cosmo [3] has produced a book on type isomorphisms. Unfortunately the implementations
  that accompanied the earlier works were for functional languages that have since
  become less popular.\n\n1. [Mikael Rittri, Using Types as Search Keys in Function
  Libraries](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=99384). Proceedings of the fourth
  international conference on Functional Programming languages and Computer Architecture:
  174-183, June 1989.\n2. [Colin Runciman and Ian Toyn, Retrieving reusable software
  components by polymorphic type](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=99383). Journal
  of Functional Programming 1 (2): 191-211, April 1991.\n3. [Roberto Di Cosmo, Isomorphisms
  of types: from lambda-calculus to information retrieval and language design](http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~dicosmo/Publications/ISObook.html).
  Birkhauser, 1995. ISBN-0-8176-3763-X\n\nI have given several presentations on type
  searching all available from [my home page](http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/hoogle).\n\n##
  Folders\n\nThe folders in the distribution, and their meaning are:\n\ndata - tools
  to generate a hoogle data file\n\ndocs - documentation on hoogle\n\nmisc - presentations,
  icons, emacs scripts, logos\n\nsrc  - source code\n\nweb  - additional resources
  for the web front end (css, jpg etc.)\n\n## Similar Tools\n\nI was unaware of any
  similar tools before starting development, and no other tool has really influenced
  this tool (except the first on this list). Some related tools are:\n\n* [Google](http://www.google.com/),
  the leader in online search\n* [Hayoo](http://holumbus.fh-wedel.de/hayoo/hayoo.html),
  similar to Hoogle, but with less focus on type search\n* [Krugle](http://www.krugle.com/),
  search code, but no Haskell :(\n* [Cloogle](https://cloogle.org), for the [Clean](http://clean.cs.ru.nl)
  language\n\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nAll code is all &copy; [Neil Mitchell](http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/),
  2004-present. The initial version was done over my summer holiday, and further work
  was done during my PhD. During Summer 2008 I was funded to full-time on Hoogle by
  [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/) with the [haskell.org](http://haskell.org/)
  mentoring organisation. Since then I have been working on Hoogle in my spare time.
  Various people have given lots of useful ideas, including my PhD supervisor [Colin
  Runciman](http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/~colin/), and various members of the [Plasma
  group](http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/plasma/). In addition, the following people have
  also contributed code or significant debugging work:\n\n* [Thomas \"Bob\" Davie](http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/rpg/tatd2/)\n*
  [Don Stewart](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/)\n* Thomas Jager\n* [Gaal Yahas](http://gaal.livejournal.com/)\n*
  [Mike Dodds](http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~miked/)\n* [Niklas Broberg](http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~d00nibro/)\n*
  Esa Ilari Vuokko\n* Udo Stenzel\n* [Henk-Jan van Tuyl](http://members.chello.nl/hjgtuyl/)\n*
  Gwern Branwen\n* Tillmann Rendel\n* David Waern\n* Ganesh Sittampalam\n* Duncan
  Coutts\n* Peter Collingbourne\n* Andrea Vezzosi\n* Ian Lynagh\n* [Alfredo Di Napoli](http://www.alfredodinapoli.com)\n\nIn
  previous versions, all the data was taken from [Zvon's Haskell Guide](http://www.zvon.org/other/haskell/Outputglobal/).
  Thanks to their open and friendly policy of allowing the data to be reused, this
  project became possible. More recent versions use the Hierarchical Libraries as
  distributed with GHC, and databases generated by Haddock.\n\n# Interesting links\n\n*
