  Initial version with very limited bindings to OpenCV 2.0. (See: <http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/Welcome>)

  For a functional interface to this library, see the package "cv-combinators".

  Online module documentation, if not build below, can be found at <http://www.ee.bgu.ac.il/~noamle/>.

  /Installation/

  You must install OpenCV (development packages) prior to installing this package. Currently only tested on Ubuntu Linux, but should work on most linux distributions. For OpenCV installation on other *nix platforms, see <http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-unix/2.0/>

  On /Ubuntu/ systems, the appropriate version of OpenCV can be installed by:

  > sudo apt-get install libcv-dev libhighgui-dev libcvaux-dev

  You should then have libcv4 and libhighgui4 installed automatically too.
