changelog: "0.5.0 Maarten Faddegon 28 Jan 2018\n\n  * Improved rendering of parens
  in computation statements\n  * A graph command contributed by Pepe Iborra\n  * Space
  improvements contributed by Pepe Iborra\n\n0.4.1 Maarten Faddegon 20 Jan 2018\n\n
  \ * Improved documentation for the new interface\n  * Several bugfixes contributed
  by Pepe Iborra\n  * Performance improvement contributed by Pepe Iborra\n\n0.4.0
  Maarten Faddegon 9 Sep 2017\n\n  * Text based interface to the debugger for closer
  integration with an interpreter (e.g. ghci)\n  * Remove many dependencies\n  * Small
  tweaks to make Hoed work with a broader range of GHC versions\n\n0.3.6 Maarten Faddegon
  22 May 2016\n\n  * Some minor fixes\n\n0.3.5 Maarten Faddegon 9 Feb 2016\n\n  *
  Give more control to restrict properties when used for judging to make approach
  sound.\n\n0.3.4 Maarten Faddegon 8 Jan 2016\n\n  * Added beta functionality of using
  properties to judge statements.\n\n0.3.3 Maarten Faddegon 6 Dec 2015\n\n  * Documentation
  and additional examples.\n\n0.3.2 Maarten Faddegon 6 Dec 2015\n\n  * Add experimental
  combinators for property-assisted algorithmic debugging.\n\n0.3.1 Maarten Faddegon
  20 Nov 2015\n\n  * Some performance improvements in Debug.Hoed.Pure; add several
  extra examples.\n\n0.3.0 Maarten Faddegon 3 Sep 2015\n\n  * Add Debug.Hoed.Pure,
  allowing computation tree tracing with higher precision without depending on the
  cost centre stack extension.\n\n0.2.2 Maarten Faddegon 14 July 2015\n\n  * Use a
  preprocessor to make the library work with GHC 7.10, but also for older versions
  of GHC. This is related to the \"The Applicative Monad Proposal\" and the changes
  to Template Haskell in GHC 7.10 that are not backward compatibility with earlier
  versions of GHC.\n\n0.2.1 Maarten Faddegon 1 May 2015\n\n  * Small changes to make
  Hoed work with GHC 7.10\n\n0.2.0 Maarten Faddegon 12 Feb 2015\n\n  * A threepenny-gui
  algorithmic debugger.\n  * Construction of computation trees with just local annotations.
  Existing algorithmic debuggers for Haskell require a transformation of all modules
  in a program, even libraries that the user does not want to debug and which may
  use language features not supported by the debugger. This is a pity, because a promising
  approach to debugging is therefore not applicable to many real-world programs. We
  use the cost centre stack from the Glasgow Haskell Compiler profiling environment
  together with runtime value observations to collect enough information for algorithmic
  debugging.\n\n0.1.0.1 Maarten Faddegon 24 May 2014\n\n  * A tracer library based
  on Andy Gills HOOD v0.2. Allows to observe intermediate values. How values are observed
  can be derived with the Generic Deriving Mechanism, or generated with Template Haskell.

description: "# Hoed - A Lightweight Haskell Tracer and Debugger \n\nHoed is a tracer
  and debugger for the programming language Haskell. To locate a defect with Hoed
  you annotate suspected functions and compile as usual. Then you run your program,
  information about the annotated functions is collected. Finally you connect to a
  debugging session.\n\nSubmit feature requests or contribute code on the\n\n  [**Github
