  Hoare was rightâ€”many concurrent programs can be simply expressed
  as a series of concurrent actors (threads) consuming and producing
  messages. Haskell provides uniquely great tools (green threads and STM)
  for doing so. This package provides:

  - Functions for using bounded STM types like
    `TBQueue` and `TMVar` as /channels/ between threads.

  - A /closeable/ @TBCQueue@ for programs where the input ends.
