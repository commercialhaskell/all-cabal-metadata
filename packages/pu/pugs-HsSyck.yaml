description: |-
  This is a simple YAML ('Yet Another Markup Language') processor,
  used by the Pugs project for handling data serialization; this can be
  useful for optimization and caching purposes.

  This is an interface to the @syck@ C library for parsing and
  dumping YAML data. It lets you transform textual YAML data into an
  object of type 'YamlNode', and vice versa, fast.
  Note: This is an old HsSyck, as it was used by Pugs ('pugs-HsSyck'). You probably want
  the more updated HsSyck, available at <http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/HsSyck>.
