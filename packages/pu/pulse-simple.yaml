  Binding to simple version of client API for the pulseaudio soundserver.
  Although it does not provide advanced features and some not-so-adavanced features like
  volume control, it should be enough for simple applications.
  Confirmed to work on linux(32 bit and 64 bit) with ghc 6.8, 6.10, 7.0.4.
