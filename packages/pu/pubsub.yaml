  Version 0.10:

    Initial release of PubSubHub Haskell package.
changelog-type: text
description: "== Intro ==\n\nThis package is an early-release of the webhooks / publish-subscribe\nprotocol
  that http://pubsubhubbub.googlecode.com/ is working and\nrapidly deploying for various
  Google services.\n\nThe protocol itself isn't tied or limited to a Google service;
  a\nnumber of hubs have been created and deployed already (see the\nabove URL for
  list.)\n\nThis Haskell package adds support for working with these\nHTTP-based publish-subscribe
  hub servers, i.e., you may\nsubscribe to notification to URLs ('topics') from a
  hub and it\nwill push updates down as they occur (rather than you polling.)\n\n==
  Getting started ==\n\nThe protocol is dependent on having some callback/endpoints\nto
  forward 'topic' updates to you locally. There's a number of\nways of providing this
  in Haskell...for testing purposes, I've\nincluded a 'fastcgi' proxy/relaying script
  that handles this;\nsee examples/Main.hs It operates by forwarding incoming requests\nto
  a local server for processing -- the thinking being that\nit provides a robust web
  front-end, leaving your basic Haskell\ncode to do the interesting bits of proccessing
  the pubsub\nnotifications. An example of how this could be done is provided\nin
  examples/Feeder.hs which uses the pubsubhub service that\nsuperfeedr.com provides.\n\nTo
  use, you need to:\n\n * build the cabal package..(!)\n * Make the fastcgi script
  pubsub.fcgi available on\n   'web-visible' URL. \n * Adjust the settings at the
  top of examples/Feeder.hs\n   to match your local settings for the script's URL
  +\n   settle on a hub to use.\n\nFor actual code / documentation on the bits that
  implement the\nvery-straightforward PubSubHub protocol, see Web/PubSub.hs\n\n\nenjoy\n--sigbjorn
