  # pure-noise

  Performant, modern noise generation for Haskell with a minimal dependency footprint.

  The algorithms used in this library are ported from [FastNoiseLite](https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoiseLite). The library structure has been retuned to fit better with Haskell semantics.

  The public interface for this library is unlikely to change much, although the implementations (`noiseBaseN` functions and anything in `Numeric.Noise.Internal`) are subject to change and may change between minor versions.

  ## Usage

  The library exports newtypes for N-dimensional noise. Currently, these are just functions that accept a seed and a point in N-dimensional space. They can be arbitrarily unwrapped by with the `noiseNAt` family of functions. Since they abstract over the given seed and parameters, they can be composed with `Num` or `Fractional` methods at will with little-to-no performance cost.

  Noise values are generally clamped to `[-1, 1]`, although some noise functions may occasionally produce values slightly outside this range.

  ```haskell
  import Numeric.Noise qualified as Noise

  myNoise2 :: (RealFrac a) => Seed -> a -> a -> a
  myNoise2 =
    let fractalConfig = Noise.defaultFractalConfig
    in Noise.noise2At $
        Noise.fractal2 fractalConfig ((perlin2 + superSimplex2) / 2)
  ```

  More examples can be found in `bench` and `demo`.

  ## Performance notes

  - This library benefits considerably from compilation with the LLVM backend (`-fllvm`). Benchmarks suggest a ~50-80% difference depending on the kind of noise.

  ## Benchmarks

  ### Results

  Measured by values / second generated by the noise functions. These results come from a benchmark with `-fllvm` enabled.

  All results are for `Float`s.

  There's inevitably some noise in the measurements because all of the results are forced into an unboxed vector.

  #### 2D

  | name          | values / second |
  | ------------- | --------------- |
  | value2        | 157_347_680     |
  | perlin2       | 129_541_747     |
  | openSimplex2  | 64_758_006      |
  | superSimplex2 | 64_072_639      |
  | valueCubic2   | 52_110_819      |
  | cellular2     | 15_743_434      |

  #### 3D

  | name        | values / second |
  | ----------- | --------------- |
  | value3      | 85_438_023      |
  | perlin3     | 56_830_482      |
  | valueCubic3 | 15_559_523      |
