  ## 1.3.7


  * Add ability to use middleware [#63](https://github.com/snoyberg/keter/pulls/63)


  ## 1.3.6


  Support the `forward-env` setting.


  ## 1.3.5.3


  More correct/complete solution for issue #44. Allows looking up hosts either with
  or without port numbers.


  ## 1.3.5.2


  Partial workaround for keter.yaml files that give a port with the hostname.


  ## 1.3.5.1


  Fix bug where the cleanup process would remain running.


  ## 1.3.5


  All stanzas may have the `requires-secure` property to force redirect to HTTPS.
  You can set additional environment variables in your global Keter config file.


  ## 1.3.4


  Support for overriding external ports. Support for keter.yml in addition to keter.yaml.
  Case insensitive hostname lookups.


  ## 1.3.3


  Set the X-Forwarded-Proto header


  ## 1.3.2


  Enable GZIP middleware


  ## 1.3.1


  Upgrade to WAI 3.0


  ## 1.3.0


  Upgrade to conduit 1.1


  ## 1.0.1


  Permit use of wildcard subdomains and exceptions to wildcards. Convert internal
  strings to use Data.Text in more places. (Although internationalized domain names
  are not supported unless entered in punycode in configuration files.)


  ## 1.0.0


  Significant overhaul. We now support monitoring of much more arbitrary jobs (e.g.,
  background tasks), have a proper plugin system (PostgreSQL is no longer a required
  component), and have a much better system for tracking hostname mapping changes.


  ## 0.4.0


  Switch to fsnotify to get cross-platform support. No longer using raw proxies, but
  instead WAI proxies.


  ## 0.3.7


  Sending a HUP signal reloads the list of deployed apps. This is useful for circumstances
  where inotify does not work correctly, such as on file systems which do not support
  it.


  ## 0.3.5


  You can now create Keter bundles without any applications. These can contain static
  hosts and redirects.

description: ! "Deployment system for web applications, originally intended for hosting
  Yesod\napplications. Keter does the following actions for your application:\n\n*
  Binds to the main port (usually port 80) and reverse proxies requests to your application
  based on virtual hostnames.\n* Provides SSL support if requested.\n* Automatically
  launches applications, monitors processes, and relaunches any processes which die.\n*
  Provides graceful redeployment support, by launching a second copy of your application,
  performing a health check, and then switching reverse proxying to the new process.\n*
  Management of log files.\n\nKeter provides many more advanced features and extension
  points. It allows\nconfiguration of static hosts, redirect rules, management of
  PostgreSQL\ndatabases, and more. It supports a simple bundle format for applications
  which\nallows for easy management of your web apps.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nTo get
  Keter up-and-running quickly on an Ubuntu system, run:\n\n    wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snoyberg/keter/master/setup-keter.sh
  | bash\n\n(Note: you may need to run the above command twice, if the shell exits
  after\n`apt-get` but before running the rest of its instructions.) This will download\nand
  build Keter from source and get it running with a\ndefault configuration. By default
  Keter will be set up to support HTTPS and\nwill require you to provide a key and
  certificate in `/opt/keter/etc`. You can\ndisable HTTPS in `/opt/keter/etc/keter-config.yaml`
  by commenting the certificate\nand key lines.\n\n_This approach is not recommended
  for a production system_. We do not recommend\ninstalling a full GHC toolchain on
  a production server, nor running such ad-hoc\nscripts. This is intended to provide
  a quick way to play with Keter, especially\nfor temporary virtual machines. For
  a production system, we recommend building\nthe `keter` binary on a separate system,
  and tracking it via a package manager\nor similar strategy.\n\n## Bundling your
  app for Keter\n\n1.  Modify your web app to check for the `PORT` environment variable,
  and have\n    it listen for incoming HTTP requests on that port. Keter automatically\n
  \   assigns arbitrary ports to each web app it manages. The Yesod scaffold\n    site
  is already equipped to read the `PORT` environment variable when\n    it is set.\n\n2.
  \ Create a file `config/keter.yaml`. The minimal file just has two settings:\n\n
  \   ```yaml\n    exec: ../path/to/executable\n    host: mydomainname.example.com\n
  \   ```\n\n    See the bundles section below for more available settings.\n\n3.
  \ Create a gzipped tarball with the `config/keter.yaml` file, your\n    executable,
  and any other static resources you would like available to your\n    application.
  This file should be given a `.keter` file extension, e.g.\n    `myapp.keter`.\n\n4.
  \ Copy the `.keter` file to `/opt/keter/incoming`. Keter will monitor this\n    directory
  for file updates, and automatically redeploy new versions of your\n    bundle.\n\n##
  Setup\n\nInstructions are for an Ubuntu system. Eventually, I hope to provide a
  PPA for\nthis (please contact me if you would like to assist with this). For now,
  the\nfollowing steps should be sufficient:\n\nFirst, install PostgreSQL\n\n    sudo
  apt-get install postgresql\n\nSecond, build the `keter` binary and place it at `/opt/keter/bin`.
  To do so,\nyou'll need to install the Haskell Platform, and can then build with
  `cabal`.\nThis would look something like:\n\n    sudo apt-get install haskell-platform\n
  \   cabal update\n    cabal install keter\n    sudo mkdir -p /opt/keter/bin\n    sudo
  cp ~/.cabal/bin/keter /opt/keter/bin\n\nThird, create a Keter config file. You can
  view a sample at\nhttps://github.com/snoyberg/keter/blob/master/etc/keter-config.yaml.\n\nFourth,
  set up an Upstart job to start `keter` when your system boots.\n\n```\n# /etc/init/keter.conf\nstart
  on (net-device-up and local-filesystems and runlevel [2345])\nstop on runlevel [016]\nrespawn\n\n#
  NB: keter writes logs to /opt/keter/log, but some exceptions occasionally\n# escape
  to standard error. This ensures they show up in system logs.\nconsole output\n\nexec
  /opt/keter/bin/keter /opt/keter/etc/keter-config.yaml\n```\n\nFinally, start the
  job for the first time:\n\n    sudo start keter\n\nOptionally, you may wish to change
  the owner on the `/opt/keter/incoming`\nfolder to your user account, so that you
  can deploy without `sudo`ing.\n\n    sudo mkdir -p /opt/keter/incoming\n    sudo
  chown $USER /opt/keter/incoming\n\n## Bundles\n\nAn application needs to be set
  up as a keter bundle. This is a GZIPed tarball\nwith a `.keter` filename extension
  and which has one special file:\n`config/keter.yaml`. A sample file is available
  at\nhttps://github.com/snoyberg/keter/blob/master/incoming/foo1_0/config/keter.yaml.\n\nKeter
  also supports wildcard subdomains and exceptions, as in this\nexample configuration:\n\n```yaml\nexec:
  ../com.example.app\nargs:\n    - Hello\n    - World\n    - 1\nhost: www.example.com\nextra-hosts:\n
  \   - \"*.example.com\"\n    - foo.bar.example.com\nstatic-hosts:\n    - host: static.example.com\n
  \     root: ../static\nredirects:\n    - from: example.com\n      to: www.example.com\n```\n\nDue
  to YAML parsing, wildcard hostnames will need to be quoted as above.\nWildcard hostnames
  are not recursive, so `foo.bar.example.com` must be\nexplicitly added as an extra
  hostname in the above example, or\nalternatively, `*.*.example.com` would cover
  all host names two levels\ndeep. It would not cover host names only one level deep,
  such as\n`qux.example.com`. In this manner, wildcard hostnames correspond to the\nmanner
  in which SSL certificates are handled per RFC2818. Wildcards may\nbe used in only
  one level of a hostname, as in `foo.*.example.com`.\n\nFull RFC2818 compliance is
  not present - `f*.example.com` will not be\nhandled as a wildcard with a prefix.\n\nA
  sample Bash script for producing a Keter bundle is:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash -ex\n\ncabal
  build\nstrip dist/build/yesodweb/yesodweb\nrm -rf static/tmp\ntar czfv yesodweb.keter
  dist/build/yesodweb/yesodweb config static\n```\n\nFor users of Yesod, The `yesod`
  executable provides a `keter` command for\ncreating the bundle, and the scaffolded
  site provides a `keter.yaml` file.\n\n## Deploying\n\nIn order to deploy, you simply
  copy the keter bundle to `/opt/keter/incoming`.\nTo update an app, copy in the new
  version. The old process will only be\nterminated after the new process has started
  answering requests. To stop an\napplication, delete the file from incoming.\n\n##
  PostgreSQL support\n\nKeter ships by default with a PostgreSQL plugin, which will
  handle\nmanagement of PostgreSQL databases for your application. To use this,\nmake
  the following changes:\n\n* Add the following lines to your `config/keter.yaml`
  file:\n\n```yaml\nplugins:\n  postgres: true\n```\n\n* Keter can be configured to
  connect to a remote postgres server using the following syntax:\n```yaml\nplugins:\n
  \ postgres: \n     - server: remoteServerNameOrIP\n       port: 1234\n```\n\nDifferent
  webapps can be configured to use different servers using the above syntax.\nIt should
  be noted that keter will prioritize it's own postgres.yaml record for an app. \nSo
  if moving an existing app from a local postgres server to a remote one (or \nswitching
  remote servers), the postgres.yaml file will need to be updated manually. \n\nKeter
  will connect to the remote servers using the `postgres` account. This setup \nassumes
  the remote server's `pg_hba.conf` file has been configured to allow connections\nfrom
  the keter-server IP using the `trust` method. \n\n(Note: The `plugins` configuration
  option was added in v1.0 of the\nketer configuration syntax. If you are using v0.4
  then use `postgres: true`.\nThe remote-postgres server syntax was added in v1.4.2.)\n\n*
  Modify your application to get its database connection settings from the following
  environment variables:\n    * `PGHOST`\n    * `PGPORT`\n    * `PGUSER`\n    * `PGPASS`\n
  \   * `PGDATABASE`\n\n* The Yesod scaffold site is already equipped to read these
  environment\n  variables when they are set.\n\n## Known issues\n\n*   There are
  reports of Keter not working behind an nginx reverse proxy. From\n    the reports,
  this appears to be a limitation in nginx's implementation, not a\n    problem with
  Keter. Keter works fine behind other reverse proxies, including\n    Apache and
  Amazon ELB.\n\n    One possible workaround is to add the following lines to your
  nginx configuration:\n\n        proxy_set_header Connection \"\";\n        proxy_http_version
  1.1;\n\n    This has not yet been confirmed to work in production. If you use this,\n
  \   please report either its success or failure back to me.\n    \n    Additionally,
  to make sure that nginx does not reset the `Host` header \n    (which keter uses
  to choose the right target), you will need to add:\n\n        proxy_set_header Host
  $host;\n\n*   Keter does not handle password-protected SSL key files well.  When
  provided\n    with such a key file, unlike Apache and Nginx, Keter will not pause
  to ask\n    for the password.  Instead, your https connections will merely stall.\n\n
  \   To get around this, you need to create a copy of the key without password\n
  \   and deploy this new key:\n\n        openssl rsa -in original.key -out new.key\n\n
  \   (Back up the original key first, just in case.)\n\n## Stanza-based config files\n\nStarting
  with Keter 1.0, there is an alternate format for application Keter\nconfig files,
  which allows much more flexibility in defining multiple\nfunctionality for a single
  bundle (e.g., more than one web app, multiple\nredirects, etc). This README will
  eventually be updated to reflect all various\noptions. In the meanwhile, please
  see the following examples of how to use this\nfile format:\n\n* https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod-scaffold/blob/postgres/config/keter.yml\n*
  https://github.com/snoyberg/keter/blob/master/incoming/foo1_0/config/keter.yaml\n\n##
  Multiple SSL Certificates\n\nKeter is able to serve different certificates for different
  hosts,\nallowing for the deployment of distinct domains using the same\nserver.
  An example `keter-config.yaml` would look like::\n\n```\nroot: ..\nlisteners:\n
  \ - host: \"*4\" # Listen on all IPv4 hosts\n    port: 80\n  - host: 127.0.0.1\n
  \   key: key.pem\n    certificate: certificate1.pem\n  - host: 127.0.0.2\n    key:
  key.pem\n    certificate: certificate2.pem\n```\n\n\nAn alternative way to make
  this possible is adding the following `ssl:` argument\nto the `keter.yaml` file
  in your Yesod app's `config folder` as follows:\n\n```\nstanzas:\n    - type: webapp\n
  \     exec: ../yourproject\n      ssl:\n        key: /opt/keter/etc/cert/yourproject.key\n
  \       certificate: /opt/keter/etc/cert/yourproject.crt\n        chain-certificates:
  []\n```\n\nIf you don't have your certificates bundled in one `.crt` file, you should
  add\nthe other certificates in the following order\n\n```\n      ssl:\n        [..]\n
  \       chain-certificates:\n          - /opt/keter/etc/middle.crt\n          -
  /opt/keter/etc/root.crt\n```\n\nThis way you can designate certificates per Yesod
  App while still having one SSL certificate\nin your main `/opt/keter/etc/keter-config.yaml`
  for your other Yesod apps to default to\nif they don't have this `ssl:` argument
  in their `config/keter.yaml`.\n\nNOTE: If you get an error that a Bool was expected
  instead of an Object when adding the `ssl:`\nargument, then for this to work you
  might need to build Keter from Github, because at the time\nof writing the version
  of Keter on Hackage does not have this functionality. Just clone or \ndownload this
  repository and build it using stack.\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n*   Keter spawns multiple failing
  process when run with `sudo start keter`.\n    *   This may be due to Keter being
  unable to find the SSL certificate and key.\n        Try to run `sudo /opt/keter/bin/keter
  /opt/keter/etc/keter-config.yaml`.\n        If it fails with `keter: etc/certificate.pem:
  openBinaryFile: does not exist`\n        or something like it, you may need to provide
  valid SSL certificates and keys\n        or disable HTTPS, by commenting the key
  and certificate lines from\n        `/opt/keter/etc/keter-config.yaml`.\n\n\n##
