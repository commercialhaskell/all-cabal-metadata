description: |-
  A layer defining RVs for HTML element fields and actions.

  Reactive Values are an abstraction for reactive programming based on setters
  and getters with change-based propagation.

  They enable easy communication/synchronization rules via Reactive Rules
  (RRs), which can keep two type-compatible RVs in sync directionally or
  bidirectionally.

  This library provides operations to turn HTML element properties and
  fields into RVs, so that they can be used to create reactive user
  interfaces with minimal effort.

  For details, please see the paper "Bridging the GUI Gap with Reactive Values
  and Relations", by Ivan Perez and Henrik Nilsson at Haskell Symposium 2015.
