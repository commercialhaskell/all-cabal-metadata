  This package contains a general definition of Reactive Values and several
  useful combinators. A reactive value is a /typed mutable value with access/
  /properties and change propagation/. Access property can be read-only,
  read-write or read-write.

  How an RV is actually implemented, and when and how change propagation is
  executed is dependent on each RV. For instance, Gtk widget properties would
  normally use the standard event-handler installers to implement change
  propagation, whereas pure Haskell values might fork a thread (or not) and
  propagate changes asynchronously.

  RVs can be created from pure models (see
  <https://github.com/keera-studios/keera-hails/tree/master/keera-hails-mvc-model-lightmodel
  keera-hails-mvc-model-lightmodel> and
  <https://github.com/keera-studios/keera-hails/tree/master/keera-hails-mvc-model-protectedmodel
  keera-hails-mvc-model-protectedmodel>), Gtk+\/WX\/Qt\/HTML DOM\/Android widget
  properties\/event handlers\/getters\/setters, files, sockets, FRP networks.
  Other backends are also available. See
  <https://github.com/keera-studios/keera-hails keera-hails> for a list of
  available backends, tutorials, etc.
