  # kempe

  ## 0.1.0.2

    * Fix major bug in kind-checker
    * Fix bug in type assignment

  ## 0.1.0.1

      something heinous at runtime

  # Kempe

  Kempe is a stack-based language and toy compiler for x86_64. It requires the
  [nasm](https://nasm.us/) assembler.

  Inspiration is primarily from [Mirth](https://github.com/mirth-lang/mirth).

  See manual
  [here](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/kempe/src/docs/manual.pdf).

  ## Installation

  Installation is via [cabal-install](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/):

  ```
  cabal install kempe
  ```

  For shell completions put the following in your `~/.bashrc` or
  `~/.bash_profile`:

  ```
  eval "$(kc --bash-completion-script kc)"
  ```

  ## Defects

    * Unification takes too long
    * Errors don't have position information
    * Monomorphization fails on recursive polymorphic functions
    * Can't export or call C functions with more than 6 arguments; can't call or
      export large arguments (i.e. structs) passed by value.

      This is less of an impediment than it sounds like.
    * Sizing for ADTs is not rigorous in places
