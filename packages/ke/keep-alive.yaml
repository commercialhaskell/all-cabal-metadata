  # keep-alive

  This module allows you to set per-connection keep alive parameters on windows and linux enviroments.
  For more information on keep alive signals see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keepalive>.
  See also <https://tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/TCP-Keepalive-HOWTO/> for a linux specific implementation.

  The module is meant to be used in conjuction with the "network" package. However, in order to ensure adaptability, all functions require
  a socket file descriptor instead of an implementation dependent socket type. For the network package, such a  descriptor can be obtained
  with the withFdSocket function:

  ```hs
   -- sock is a Socket type
   withFdSocket sock $ \fd -> do
      before <- getKeepAliveOnOff fd
      print before -- False
      -- set keep alive on, idle 60 seconds, interval 2 seconds
      rlt <- setKeepAlive fd $ KeepAlive True 60 2
      case rlt of
          Left err -> print err
          Right () -> return ()
      after <- getKeepAliveOnOff fd
      print after -- True
  ```

  Please note that only the envocing process can manipulate sockets based on their file descriptors.
