description: |-
  Keera Hails is a rapid application development system.

  The idea behind Hails is that you should be able to build cross platform
  applications with minimal effort, very quickly, and the result should be easy
  to maintain.

  Large Hails applications are structured following an optimized MVC
  architecture. Values are updated either from the view to the model, or from
  the model to the view. Internally, rules use a notion of direction in the
  update to determine how different components must be updated.

  This library provides a way to access files as reactive values, so that changes
  to files trigger reactive rule propagations, and thay can be used in reactive
  rules to write values into files.
