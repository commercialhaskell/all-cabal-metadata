description: |-
  The Xorshift random generator is a very fast generator that uses
  only XOR and bitshifting operations. This package contains a basic version
  with a periode of 2^32-1 for 32-bit numbers and a version with a periode of
  2^64-1 for 64-bit numbers.

  Although the author didn't tested the random generator,
  but according to it's specification the resulting numbers are of good
  quality.
