  # Update Monad

  The update monad is a generalized (and pretty abstract) monad which can be specialized to implement any of Reader,
  Writer, or State! Check out [this paper](https://danelahman.github.io/papers/types13postproc.pdf) for a description.

  This repo implements both the update monad transformer (`UpdateT`) and an
  experiment called `FreeUpdateT` which forgoes the traditional requirement of
  using a monoid as the 'action' of the update monad by substituting a free
  monoid (i.e. `[action]`). It also defers the choice of an
  `act :: action -> state -> state` function until the last second when the monad
  is run (rather than using a typeclass); this conveniently allows you to
  substitute out the `act` function for testing or alternate behaviour without
  needing to rewrite or transform the monadic values themselves. Nifty!

  Yes; I know I could implement `Update` in terms of `UpdateT Identity`; but implementing
  them separately is clearer for people learning how it works.
