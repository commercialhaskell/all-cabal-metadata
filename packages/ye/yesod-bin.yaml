changelog: |

  * Support Cabal 3.0

  ## 1.6.0.3

  * Support Cabal 2.2 [#1151](https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod/issues/1511)

  ## 1.6.0.2

  * Fix broken support for older http-reverse-proxy

  ## 1.6.0.1

  * Support for http-reverse-proxy 0.6

  ## 1.6.0

  * Upgrade to conduit 1.3.0
  * Remove configure, build, touch, and test commands

  ## 1.5.3

  * Support typed-process-0.2.0.0

  ## 1.5.2.6

  * Drop an upper bound

  ## 1.5.2.5

  * Support for `add-handler` when modules are in `src/` directory [#1413](https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod/issues/1413)

  ## 1.5.2.4

  * Cabal 2.0 support

  ## 1.5.2.3

  * Fix race condition which leads dev server to stay in compilation mode. [#1380](https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod/issues/1380)

  ## 1.5.2.2

  * I guess `--no-nix-pure` implies Nix... sigh [#1359](https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod/issues/1359)

  ## 1.5.2.1

  * Use `--no-nix-pure` [#1357](https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod/issues/1357)

  ## 1.5.2

  * Fix warnings

  ## 1.5.1

  * Add `--host` option to `yesod devel`

  ## 1.5.0.1

  * Fix build failure

  ## 1.5.0

  Rewrite of `yesod devel` to take advantage of Stack for a simpler codebase.

  Advantages:

  * Does not link against the ghc library, so can be used with multiple
    GHC versions
  * Leverages Stack's ability to check for dependent files, which is
    more robust than what yesod devel was doing previously
  * Seems to involve less rebuilding of the library on initial run

  Disadvantages:

  * Lost some functionality (e.g., failure hooks, controlling the exit
    command)
  * Newer codebase, quite likely has bugs that need to be ironed out.

  ## 1.4.18.7

  * Actually release the changes for #1284

  ## 1.4.18.6

  * Fix support for GHC 8.0.1 [#1284](https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod/issues/1284)

  ## yesod-bin: the Yesod executable

  This executable is almost exclusively used for its `yesod devel`
  capabilities, providing a development server for web apps. It also
  provides some legacy functionality, almost all of which has been
  superceded by functionality in the
  [Haskell Stack build tool](http://haskellstack.org/). This README will
  speak exclusively about `yesod devel`.

  __CAVEAT__ There may be some issues using `yesod devel` in Docker-enabled
  projects. See [comment on
  Github](https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod/pull/1305#issuecomment-263204471).

  ### Development server

  The development server will automatically recompile your application
  whenever you make source code changes. It will then launch your app,
  and reverse-proxy to it. The reverse proxying ensures that you can
  connect to your application on a dedicated port, always get the latest
  version available, and won't get dropped connections when the app
  isn't yet ready. Instead, you'll get some very motivating messages:

  ![Motivation](https://i.sli.mg/nO6DvN.png)

  ## Common workflows

  The standard Yesod scaffoldings are configured to work with `yesod
  devel` out of the box (though see below for non-Yesod
  development). For the most part, from within your application
  directory, you'll just want to run:

  * `stack build yesod-bin`
  * `stack exec -- yesod devel`

  This will install the corresponding version of the `yesod` executable
  into your currently selected snapshot, and then use that
  executable. (Starting with version 1.5.0, you can be more lax and use
  a `yesod` executable compiled for a different snapshot. Once 1.5.0 is
  more widespread we'll probably update these instructions.)

  Some other common questions:

  * If you want to control which port you can access your application
    on, use the `--port` command line option, e.g. `stack exec -- yesod
    devel --port 4000`. Changing your port inside your source code _will
    not work_, because you need to change the reverse proxying port.
  * If you want to run a command after each successful build, you can
    use `stack exec -- yesod devel --success-hook "echo Yay!"`
  * If for some reason you want to disable the reverse proxy
    capabilities, use `stack exec -- yesod devel
    --disable-reverse-proxy`

  ## How it works

  The workflow of the devel server is pretty simple:

  * Launch a reverse proxy server
  * Use Stack file-watch capability to run a build loop on your code,
    rebuilding each time a file is modified
  * Have Stack call `yesod devel-signal` to write to a specific file
    (`yesod-devel/rebuild`) each time a rebuild is successful
  * Each time `yesod-devel/rebuild` is modified:
    * Kill the current child process
    * Get a new random port
    * Tell the reverse proxy server about the new port to forward to
    * Run the application's devel script with two environment variables
      set:
      * `PORT` gives the newly generated random port. The application
        needs to listen on that port.
      * `DISPLAY_PORT` gives the port that the reverse proxy is
        listening on, used for display purposes or generating URLs.

  Now some weird notes:

  * The devel script can be one of the following three files. `yesod
    devel` will search for them in the given order. That script must
    provide a `main` function.
    * `app/devel.hs`
    * `devel.hs`
    * `src/devel.hs`
  * Unfortunately, directly killing the `ghc` interpreter has never
    worked reliably, so we have an extra hack: when killing the process,
    `yesod devel` also writes to a file
    `yesod-devel/devel-terminate`. Your devel script should respect this
    file and shutdown whenever it exists.
  * If your .cabal file defines them, `yesod devel` will tell Stack to
    build with the flags `dev` and `library-only`. You can use this to
    speed up compile times (biggest win: skip building executables, thus
    the name `library-only`).

  If that all seems a little complicated, remember that the Yesod
  scaffolding handles all of this for you. But if you want to implement
  it yourself...

  ## Non-Yesod development

  If you'd like to use the `yesod devel` server for your non-Yesod
  application, or even for a Yesod application not based on the
  scaffolding, this section is for you! We've got a
  [sample application in the repository](https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod/tree/master/yesod-bin/devel-example)
  that demonstrates how to get this set up. It demonstrates a good way
  to jump through the hoops implied above.

  One important note: I highly recommend putting _all_ of the logic in
  your library, and then providing a `develMain :: IO ()` function which
  your `app/devel.hs` script reexports as `main`. I've found this to
  greatly simplify things overall, since you can ensure all of your
  dependencies are specified correctly in your `.cabal` file. Also, I
  recommend using `PackageImports` in that file, as the example app
  shows.
