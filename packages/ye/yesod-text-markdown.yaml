description: ! 'Use Text.Markdown in a typical yesod project.

  This module contains instances related to persistence,

  even though it isn''t tightly coupled to yesod.


  This package is different from the yesod-markdown package

  which uses the pandoc renderer for markdown. The main

  advantages of having Text.Markdown as underlying renderer

  is the much smaller dependencies and the permissiver

  license.  See

  <https://github.com/pbrisbin/yesod-markdown> and

  <https://github.com/snoyberg/markdown>.


  This package intentionally tries to be like

  yesod-markdown, so switching between the markdown backends

  should be easy.


  If you wonder why the haddocks only show a few exports,

  it''s because it doesn''t show exporting of instances which

  is most of what this package is about.'
