  # 1.2.1.2 (January 7th, 2022)

  - Compatibility with `template-haskell` versions through 2.18 (which is distributed with GHC 9.2) ([#34](https://github.com/lexi-lambda/freer-simple/issues/34)).

  # 1.2.1.1 (October 4th, 2019)

  - Loosened bounds on `template-haskell` ([#29](https://github.com/lexi-lambda/freer-simple/issues/29)).
  - Made some minor internal changes to better support GHC 8.8.

  # 1.2.1.0 (November 15th, 2018)

  - Improved `makeEffect` from `Control.Monad.Freer.TH` to support more datatypes ([#17](https://github.com/lexi-lambda/freer-simple/pull/17)).

  # 1.2.0.0 (October 23rd, 2018)

  - Added `Control.Monad.Freer.TH`, which provides a `makeEffect` function that automatically generates boilerplate operations using `send` for an effect ([#15](https://github.com/lexi-lambda/freer-simple/pull/15)).

  # 1.1.0.0 (February 20th, 2018)

  - Changed the implementation of `LastMember` to avoid an issue similar to the one with `Member` fixed in 1.0.1.1 that could cause the constraint to unnecessarily fail to solve ([#6](https://github.com/lexi-lambda/freer-simple/issues/6)).
  - Changed the order of the type variables in `interpretM` to be more consistent with other functions (only relevant in combination with `TypeApplications`).
  - Re-exported `(~>)` from `Control.Natural` through `Control.Monad.Freer`.

  # 1.0.1.1 (January 31st, 2018)

  - Fixed a bug that could cause `Member` constraints to erroneously fail to solve ([#3](https://github.com/lexi-lambda/freer-simple/pull/3)).

  # 1.0.1.0 (January 27th, 2018)

  - Added `subsume` to `Control.Monad.Freer` for deduplicating effects.
  - Added `gets` to `Control.Monad.Freer.State` ([#1](https://github.com/lexi-lambda/freer-simple/pull/1)).

  # 1.0.0.0 (December 7th, 2017)

  - Initial release.

  # freer-simple — a friendly effect system for Haskell [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/lexi-lambda/freer-simple/build/master)](https://github.com/lexi-lambda/freer-simple/actions/workflows/build.yml) [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/badge/hackage-1.2.1.2-5e5184)][hackage]

  The `freer-simple` library is an implementation of an *extensible effect system* for Haskell, a general-purpose way of tracking effects at the type level and handling them in different ways. The concept of an “effect” is very general: it encompasses the things most people consider side-effects, like generating random values, interacting with the file system, and mutating state, but it also includes things like access to an immutable global environment and exception handling.

  The key features of `freer-simple` are:

    - An efficient effect system for Haskell as a library.

    - Implementations for several common Haskell monads as effects, including `Reader`, `Writer`, `State`, `Error`, and others.

    - A combinator language for defining your own effects, designed to make simple, common use cases easy to read and write.

  [**For more details, see the package documentation on Hackage.**][hackage]

  ## Code example

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE LambdaCase #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-}

  import qualified Prelude
  import qualified System.Exit

  import Prelude hiding (putStrLn, getLine)

  import Control.Monad.Freer
  import Control.Monad.Freer.TH
  import Control.Monad.Freer.Error
  import Control.Monad.Freer.State
  import Control.Monad.Freer.Writer

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 -- Effect Model --
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  data Console r where
    PutStrLn    :: String -> Console ()
    GetLine     :: Console String
    ExitSuccess :: Console ()
  makeEffect ''Console

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            -- Effectful Interpreter --
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  runConsole :: Eff '[Console, IO] a -> IO a
  runConsole = runM . interpretM (\case
    PutStrLn msg -> Prelude.putStrLn msg
    GetLine -> Prelude.getLine
    ExitSuccess -> System.Exit.exitSuccess)

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               -- Pure Interpreter --
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  runConsolePure :: [String] -> Eff '[Console] w -> [String]
  runConsolePure inputs req = snd . fst $
      run (runWriter (runState inputs (runError (reinterpret3 go req))))
    where
      go :: Console v -> Eff '[Error (), State [String], Writer [String]] v
      go (PutStrLn msg) = tell [msg]
      go GetLine = get >>= \case
        [] -> error "not enough lines"
        (x:xs) -> put xs >> pure x
      go ExitSuccess = throwError ()
  ```
