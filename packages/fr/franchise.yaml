description: |-
  Franchise is an easy-to use package for building Haskell
  software.  Unlike Cabal, you aren't required to track every
  possible dependency in every possible build condition.  In
  addition, you are not required to use an external tool such as
  autoconf in order to configure the build based on which
  packages, libraries and tools are present.
  Note: the cabal dependencies are autogenerated, and approximate.
