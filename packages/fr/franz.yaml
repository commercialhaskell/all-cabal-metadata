  # Franz

  ![Haskell CI](https://github.com/fumieval/franz/workflows/Haskell%20CI/badge.svg)

  Franz is an append-only container format, forked from liszt.

  Each stream is stored as a pair of concatenated payloads with an array of their
  byte offsets.

  ## Design requirements

  * The writer must be integrated so that no server failure blocks the application.
  * There's a way to archive streams into one file.
  * There's a way to fetch data in a period of time efficiently.
      * In particular, the server should be able to search by timestamps, rather than performing binary search by the client.
  * The server must not take too long to restart.

  ## Usecase

  * Instances of franzd are running on a remote server and a local gateway.
  * The application produces franz files locally using the writer API.
  * On the local gateway, a proxy connects to the remote server and downsamples the file.
  * Clients can connect to the gateway. When needed, they may also connect directly to the remote server.

  ## Format details

  The on-disk representation of a franz stream comprises the following files:

  * `payloads`: concatenated payloads
  * `offsets`: A sequence of N-tuples of 64-bit little endian integers representing
      * 0th: byte offsets of payloads
      * nth, n ∈ [1..N]: the value of nth index, where N is the number of index names
  * `indices`: Line-separated list of index names. An index represents a 64 bit little-endian integer attached to a payload.

  A stream is stored as a directory containing the files above.

  The Franz reader also supports a squashfs image, provided that the content is a valid franz stream.

  ## franzd

  franzd is a read-only server which follows franz files and gives access on wire.
  Where to look for streams can be specified as a command-line argument, separately for live streams and squashfs images.

  Each stream is stored as a pair of concatenated payloads with an array of their
  byte offsets.

  ## Why not Kafka

  - None of us want to debug/contribute to kafka.
  - Trying to read from a stream creates the stream (this is a problem due to the way we name our streams and rely on `latest`)
  - Can't delete a stream as long as there is a reader existing
  - Lack of understanding of it (but there is a lot of good documentation out there. [recommended][1])
  - Kafka takes a long time to start up after an abnormal shutdown on the server side
  - Supports clustering but sometimes makes the reliability of the whole system worse

  ## Design requirements

  * The writer must be integrated so that no external process make logging fail.
  * There's a way to archive streams into one file.
  * There's a way to read streams without a server.
  * There's a way to fetch data in a period of time efficiently.
      * In particular, the server should be able to search by timestamps or gen nums, rather than performing binary search by the client.
  * The server must not take too long to restart.

  ## Usecase

  * Instances of franzd are running on a remote server and a local gateway.
  * The application produces franz files locally using the writer API.
  * On the local gateway, a proxy connects to the remote server and downsamples the file.
  * Clients can connect to the gateway. When needed, they may also connect directly to the remote server.

  The Franz reader also supports a squashfs image, provided that the content is a valid franz stream.

  ## franzd

  franzd is a read-only server which follows franz files and gives access on wire.
  Where to look for streams can be specified as a command-line argument, separately for live streams and squashfs images.

  ```
  franzd --live /path/to/live --archive /path/to/archive
  ```

  You can obtain a `Connection` to a remote franz file with `withConnection`.
  It tries to mount a squashfs image at `path`. This is shared between connections, and unmounts when the last client closes the connection.

  ```haskell
  withConnection :: (MonadIO m, MonadMask m)
    => String -- host
    -> Int -- port
    -> ByteString -- path
    -> (Connection -> m r) -> m r
  ```

  `fetch` returns a list of triples of offsets, tags, and payloads.

  ```haskell
  data RequestType = AllItems | LastItem deriving (Show, Generic)

  data ItemRef = BySeqNum !Int -- ^ sequential number
    | ByIndex !B.ByteString Int -- ^ index name and value

  data Query = Query
    { reqStream :: !B.ByteString
    , reqFrom :: !ItemRef -- ^ name of the index to search
    , reqTo :: !ItemRef -- ^ name of the index to search
    , reqType :: !RequestType
    } deriving (Show, Generic)

  type SomeIndexMap = HM.HashMap B.ByteString Int64

  type Contents = [(Int, SomeIndexMap, B.ByteString)]

  -- | When it is 'Right', it blocks until the content is available on the server.
  type Response = Either Contents (STM Contents)

  fetch :: Connection
    -> Query
    -> (STM Response -> IO r)
    -- ^ running the STM action blocks until the response arrives
    -> IO r
  ```

  ## franz CLI: reading

  Read 0th to 9th elements

  ```
  franz test -r 0:9
  ```

  Follow a stream

  ```
  franz test -b _1
