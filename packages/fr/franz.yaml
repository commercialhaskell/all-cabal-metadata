  # v0.5.3

  * It now delays a response if it fails to resolve the range specified by `ByIndex`

  # v0.5.2

  * Fixed the undesirable behaviour that causes an empty response when `BySeqNum (-1)` is specified
  * Expanded `Reconnect` so that the query that caused a reconnection is visible

  # v0.5.1

  * Fixed the bug adding all the following payloads in the result of `index`
  * Added `FirstItem` to `RequestType`

  # v0.5

  * Renamed internal modules under `Internal` prefix
  * Renamed `Database.Franz.Reconnect` to `Database.Franz.Client.Reconnect`

  # v0.4

  * Added `StreamName`
      * `reqStream` now has a type `StreamName`

  # Franz

  ![Haskell CI](https://github.com/fumieval/franz/workflows/Haskell%20CI/badge.svg)

  Franz is an append-only container format, forked from liszt.

  Each stream is stored as a pair of concatenated payloads with an array of their
  byte offsets.

  ## Design requirements

  * The writer must be integrated so that no server failure blocks the application.
  * There's a way to archive streams into one file.
  * There's a way to fetch data in a period of time efficiently.
      * In particular, the server should be able to search by timestamps, rather than performing binary search by the client.
  * The server must not take too long to restart.

  ## Usecase

  * Instances of franzd are running on a remote server and a local gateway.
  * The application produces franz files locally using the writer API.
  * On the local gateway, a proxy connects to the remote server and downsamples the file.
  * Clients can connect to the gateway. When needed, they may also connect directly to the remote server.

  ## Format details

  The on-disk representation of a franz stream comprises the following files:

  * `payloads`: concatenated payloads
  * `offsets`: A sequence of N-tuples of 64-bit little endian integers representing
      * 0th: byte offsets of payloads
      * nth, n ∈ [1..N]: the value of nth index, where N is the number of index names
  * `indices`: Line-separated list of index names. An index represents a 64 bit little-endian integer attached to a payload.

  A stream is stored as a directory containing the files above.

  The Franz reader also supports a squashfs image, provided that the content is a valid franz stream.

  ## franzd

  franzd is a read-only server which follows franz files and gives access on wire.
  Where to look for streams can be specified as a command-line argument, separately for live streams and squashfs images.

  Each stream is stored as a pair of concatenated payloads with an array of their
  byte offsets.

  ```
  franzd --live /path/to/live --archive /path/to/archive
  ```

  ## Why not Kafka

  - None of us want to debug/contribute to kafka.
  - Trying to read from a stream creates the stream (this is a problem due to the way we name our streams and rely on `latest`)
  - Can't delete a stream as long as there is a reader existing
  - Lack of understanding of it (but there is a lot of good documentation out there. [recommended][1])
  - Kafka takes a long time to start up after an abnormal shutdown on the server side
  - Supports clustering but sometimes makes the reliability of the whole system worse

  ## Client API

  `Database.Franz.Client` exposes the client API.

  You can obtain a `Connection` to a remote franz file with `withConnection`.
  It tries to mount a squashfs image at `path`. This is shared between connections, and unmounts when the last client closes the connection.

  ```haskell
  toFranzPath :: String -> Either String FranzPath

  withConnection :: (MonadIO m, MonadMask m)
    => FranzPath
    -> (Connection -> m r) -> m r
  ```

  ```haskell
  data RequestType = AllItems | LastItem deriving (Show, Generic)

  data ItemRef = BySeqNum !Int -- ^ sequential number
    | ByIndex !IndexName Int -- ^ index name and value

  data Query = Query
    { reqStream :: !StreamName
    , reqFrom :: !ItemRef -- ^ name of the index to search
    , reqTo :: !ItemRef -- ^ name of the index to search
    , reqType :: !RequestType
    } deriving (Show, Generic)

  -- | When it is 'Right', it blocks until the content is available on the server.
  type Response = Either Contents (STM Contents)

  fetch :: Connection
    -> Query
    -> (STM Response -> IO r)
    -- ^ running the STM action blocks until the response arrives
    -> IO r
  ```

  `Contents` is a datatype containing triples of sequential numbers, indices and payloads. It is recommended to import `Database.Franz.Contents` qualified.

  ```haskell
  data Contents

  data Item = Item
    { seqNo :: !Int
    , indices :: !(U.Vector Int64)
    , payload :: !B.ByteString
    } deriving (Show, Eq)

  toList :: Contents -> [Item]
  ```

  ## Writer API

  `Database.Franz.Writer` provides the writer interface.

  ```haskell
  withWriter :: Foldable f
    => f String
    -> FilePath
    -> (WriterHandle f -> IO a)
    -> IO a
  ```

  `withWriter` acquires a handle. The `f String` parameter represents a list of index names.

  ```haskell
  write :: Foldable f
    => WriterHandle f
    -> f Int64 -- ^ index values
    -> Builder -- ^ payload
    -> IO Int
  flush :: WriterHandle f -> IO ()
  ```

  `write` appends a payload to the stream. `f Int64` is the list of index values, and it has to have the same length as the one you specified in `withWriter`. Changes will be written to disk whenever the buffer gets full or you call `flush`.

  If you don't need the index mechanism, you can use `Database.Franz.Writer.Simple` instead.
