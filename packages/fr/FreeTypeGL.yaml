description: |-
  Based on the freetype-gl library, with large
  modifications.

  This is similar to the FTGL (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/FTGL>)
  library, but avoids C++, which makes it easier to wrap and work with
  in Haskell-land.

  Unfortunately, it seems not to perform as well as
  FTGL on some setups.

  NOTE: Most of the demos and C-side documentation
  are out-of-date, as the C side was heavily
  modified, without updating many of the demos or
  the C documentation.
