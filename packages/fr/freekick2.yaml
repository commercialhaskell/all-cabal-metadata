description: "Freekick2 Readme\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nFreekick2 is an open
  source 2D arcade style soccer game.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nFreekick2 can
  be installed from sources using cabal (see \nhttp://www.haskell.org/cabal/).\n\nStep-by-step:\n\n1.
  Install cabal if you haven't already.\n\nTo install system-wide, switch to the directory
  with freekick2 sources and do:\n\n2. $ cabal configure\n3. $ cabal build\n4. # cabal
  install\n\nTo install user-wide, use \n\n\"cabal configure --user\" \n\ninstead
  of \n\n\"cabal configure\".\n\nFreekick2 depends on some libraries that can be found
  in Hackage, including \nSDL, OpenGL, FTGL and others. See the freekick2.cabal file
  for a list.\n\nFreekick2 depends on some Haskell extensions, at least some of which,
  as far \nas I know, have only been implemented in GHC. I haven't tried compiling\nfreekick2
  with a different compiler.\n\nWhen installing freekick2 from source, three executables
  are built:\n\n1. freekick2 - this is the actual game.\n2. swos2gen - a program for
  creating freekick2 tactics and teams from \nSensible Soccer tactics and teams -
  see below.\n3. createteam - a program for creating random teams.\n\nAlternatively,
  you can install freekick2 from Hackage, with a simple\n\"cabal install freekick2\".\n\nPlaying\n=======\n\nTo
  run, simply type in freekick2. Click on the teams to choose them.\nPink background
  means the team is controlled by the computer. Blue means it's\ncontrolled by a human.
  Currently only one team can be controlled by a human.\nYou can control all players
  except the goalkeeper during the match, but restarts\nare handled by the computer.
  Use the arrow keys to run around with the player \nyou're controlling and the right
  control key to shoot the ball. The longer you\nhold down the right control key the
  stronger the shot will be.\n\nTeams\n=====\n\nFreekick2 includes some made-up teams.
  If you want to play with other teams,\nyou can convert Sensible Soccer teams into
  freekick2 teams if you have the\ndata files.\n\nUsage:\n\nswos2gen 0 <fromdir> <todir>\n\nswos2gen
  converts the files in the given directory to freekick2 files. All\nthe files in
  the given directory must be in the given format. To install your\nnew teams, copy
  the files to ~/.freekick2/teams or, in Windows, to\nC:\\Documents And Settings\\user\\Application
  Data\\freekick2\\teams (insert your\nusername).\n\nTroubleshooting\n===============\n\nIf
  you have any problems, or other feedback, let me know.\najsalonen <at> gmail <dot>
  com.\n\nAntti Salonen\n\n"
