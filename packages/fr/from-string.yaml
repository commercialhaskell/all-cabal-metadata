  # Changelog for `from-string`

  All notable changes to this project should be documented in this file.

  The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to the [Haskell Package Versioning Policy](https://pvp.haskell.org/).

  ## 1.0.0.1 - 2025-10-24

  ### Changed

  - Set upper/lower bound for the dependencies: `bytestring`, `text`, and `from`.

  ## 1.0.0.0 - 2025-10-24

  Initial release.

  ### Added

  - `From` instances for string-related types. Any of the following types can be converted from one to another using `from`:
      - `Prelude.String`
      - `Data.Text.Text`
      - `Data.Text.Lazy.Text`
      - `Data.Text.Lazy.Builder.Builder`
      - `Data.ByteString.ByteString`
      - `Data.ByteString.Lazy.ByteString`
      - `Data.ByteString.Builder.Builder`
      - `Data.ByteString.Short.ShortByteString`
  - When the conversion crosses the boundary of the byte-sequence types and the character-sequence types, UTF-8 is assumed.

  # from-string

  Note that this package is a part of the "project" that includes from and from-string. For the general rationale behind this idea, see `README.md` under the project root.

  This Haskell library package provides the `From` typeclass **instances** for the conversion of following types:

  - `String`
  - bytestring:
      - Strict `ByteString`
      - Lazy `ByteString`
      - `Builder` for `ByteString`
      - `ShortByteString`
  - text:
      - Strict `Text`
      - Lazy `Text`
      - `Builder` for `Text`

  Whenever encoding/decoding happens, this library assumes that the aforementioned types internally contains either

  - a sequence of Unicode characters, or
  - a sequence of bytes in UTF-8.

  This should be a reasonable assumption for practical software development. If you need any other assumption, you should specify the accurate conversion in the code, instead of 'from'.

  See the `From.String` module documentation for more detail.
