  # friday-juicypixels

  This library facilitates conversion between [friday](https://github.com/RaphaelJ/friday)
  (an all-Haskell image manipulation library) and
  [JuicyPixels](https://github.com/Twinside/Juicy.Pixels) (an all-Haskell encoder/decoder
  library for many image formats). Combining these two libraries is useful for adding basic
  image manipulation capabilities of many image formats to a Haskell application without
  requiring any C libraries/headers to be installed.

  **NOTE:** Expect this library's API to break, as it is still very young.


  ### Compared to `friday-devil`

  The `friday-devil` package provides a storage backend to `friday` by calling the
  [DevIL](https://github.com/DentonW/DevIL) library. It is much more mature, and probably
  a lot faster (though benchmarks have yet to prove this).

  This package is not in the spirit of `friday-devil` which is a more native bridge than
  conversion .  As such, it should probabably be called something different like
  `juicy-friday`.


  ### TODO

  * Make it into a storage backend that automatically converts all formats and
    color spaces supported by `JuicyPixels` to the internal representations
    supported by `friday`.
  * Add some benchmarks. Include `friday-devil` and ImageMagik.
  * Add more specs.

  Done:

  * Conversion between JP and Friday for cheap using `coerce` and `unsafeCoerce`, yay!
  * Basic test suite.
