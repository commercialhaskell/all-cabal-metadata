description: ! "# friday-juicypixels\n\nThis library facilitates conversion between
  [friday](https://github.com/RaphaelJ/friday)\n(an all-Haskell image manipulation
  library) and\n[JuicyPixels](https://github.com/Twinside/Juicy.Pixels) (an all-Haskell
  encoder/decoder\nlibrary for many image formats). Combining these two libraries
  is useful for adding basic\nimage manipulation capabilities of many image formats
  to a Haskell application without\nrequiring any C libraries/headers to be installed.\n\n**NOTE:**
  Expect this library's API to break, as it is still very young.\n\n\n### Compared
  to `friday-devil`\n\nThe `friday-devil` package provides a storage backend to `friday`
  by calling the\n[DevIL](https://github.com/DentonW/DevIL) library. It is much more
  mature, and probably\na lot faster (though benchmarks have yet to prove this).\n\nThis
  package is not in the spirit of `friday-devil` which is a more native bridge than\nconversion
  .  As such, it should probabably be called something different like\n`juicy-friday`.\n\n\n###
  TODO\n\n* Make it into a storage backend that automatically converts all formats
  and\n  color spaces supported by `JuicyPixels` to the internal representations\n
  \ supported by `friday`.\n* Add some benchmarks. Include `friday-devil` and ImageMagik.\n*
  Add more specs.\n\nDone:\n\n* Conversion between JP and Friday for cheap using `coerce`
  and `unsafeCoerce`, yay!\n* Basic test suite.\n\n\n### License\n\nReleased under
  a 3-clause BSD license.\n\n"
