changelog: ! "-*-change-log-*-\n\nv0.2.4.0 TDB\n\nv0.2.3.1 December 2016\n * Merge
  fix for storable instance\n\nv0.2.3.0 December 2016\n * Add Contour Tracing (Vision.Image.Contour)\n
  * Add pointer to friday-juicypixels\n * First release by TomMD - Raphael is MIA
  but it remains his package.\n\nv0.2.2.0 June 2015\n * New 'computeP' function to
  compute an image in parallel.\n\nv0.2.1.2 May 2015\n * Add test modules under `other-modules`.\n\nv0.2.1.1
  April 2015\n * Removes an orphan dependency to bytetring.\n * Fixes some warning
  when compiled with GHC 7.10.\n\nv0.2.1.0 March 2015\n * Grey to HSV conversion.\n\nv0.2.0.2
  February 2015\n * Minor documentation improvements.\n\nv0.2.0.1 January 2015\n *
  Setup.hs script.\n\nv0.2 January 2015\n BREAKING CHANGES:\n   * Origin is on the
  upper left corner of the image (was bottom left).\n   * New simplified filters interface.
  The old interface is still used\n     internally to create filters and is available
  in\n     Vision.Image.Filter.Internal.\n   * DevIL bindings (Vision.Image.Storage)
  are now in a separate package\n     (friday-devil) and with an improved interface.\n
  \  * Benchmarks are now in a separate package (friday-bench).\n   * Examples are
  now in a separate package (friday-examples).\n   * Pixel instance is no more required
  for MaskedImage and Image instances.\n\n * SCW thresholding.\n * New types aliases
  for filters.\n * New (!) and (!?) operators for image and histogram indexing.\n
  * Classes and image types are in two different files (Vision.Image.Class and\n   Vision.Image.Type).\n
  * NFData instance for Manifest images.\n\nv0.1 August 2014\n * Initial release\n"

description: ! 'Friday provides functions to manipulate images in a

  functional way.

  The library is designed to be fast, generic and

  type-safe.


  Images can be represented in two representations:


  * the ''Manifest'' representation stores images in Haskell

  ''Vector''s ;


  * the ''Delayed'' representation uses functions to produce

  images pixels. These images can be combined to produce

  complex transformations. By some inlining, Haskell

  compilers are able to produce fast algorithms by

  removing intermediate structures.


  The library currently support four color spaces: RGB,

  RGBA, HSV and gray-scale images.
