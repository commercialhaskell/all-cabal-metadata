  -*-change-log-*-

  v0.2.4.0 TDB
   * Minimum base is now 4.8

  v0.2.3.1 December 2016
   * Merge fix for storable instance

  v0.2.3.0 December 2016
   * Add Contour Tracing (Vision.Image.Contour)
   * Add pointer to friday-juicypixels
   * First release by TomMD - Raphael is MIA but it remains his package.

  v0.2.2.0 June 2015
   * New 'computeP' function to compute an image in parallel.

  v0.2.1.2 May 2015
   * Add test modules under `other-modules`.

  v0.2.1.1 April 2015
   * Removes an orphan dependency to bytetring.
   * Fixes some warning when compiled with GHC 7.10.

  v0.2.1.0 March 2015
   * Grey to HSV conversion.

  v0.2.0.2 February 2015
   * Minor documentation improvements.

  v0.2.0.1 January 2015
   * Setup.hs script.

  v0.2 January 2015
   BREAKING CHANGES:
     * Origin is on the upper left corner of the image (was bottom left).
     * New simplified filters interface. The old interface is still used
       internally to create filters and is available in
       Vision.Image.Filter.Internal.
     * DevIL bindings (Vision.Image.Storage) are now in a separate package
       (friday-devil) and with an improved interface.
     * Benchmarks are now in a separate package (friday-bench).
     * Examples are now in a separate package (friday-examples).
     * Pixel instance is no more required for MaskedImage and Image instances.

   * SCW thresholding.
   * New types aliases for filters.
   * New (!) and (!?) operators for image and histogram indexing.
   * Classes and image types are in two different files (Vision.Image.Class and
     Vision.Image.Type).
   * NFData instance for Manifest images.

  v0.1 August 2014
   * Initial release

description: |-
  Friday provides functions to manipulate images in a
  functional way.
  The library is designed to be fast, generic and
  type-safe.

  Images can be represented in two representations:

  * the 'Manifest' representation stores images in Haskell
  'Vector's ;

  * the 'Delayed' representation uses functions to produce
  images pixels. These images can be combined to produce
  complex transformations. By some inlining, Haskell
  compilers are able to produce fast algorithms by
  removing intermediate structures.

  The library currently support four color spaces: RGB,
  RGBA, HSV and gray-scale images.

  Please read our
  <https://github.com/RaphaelJ/friday/blob/master/README.md README>
  to get a detailed usage and some examples.
