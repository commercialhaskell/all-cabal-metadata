description: |-
  One can think of an effectful program and its effect
  handler as /two communicating processes/.
  This package provides the missing pieces that let you
  write your programs in such a style in
  @Control.Monad.Freer.Converse@.

  One useful area of application is unit testing. The
  @Control.Monad.Freer.TestControl@ intends to provide what
  you need to write /ad-hoc test fixtures/.
