  [![frecently on Stackage Nightly](https://stackage.org/package/frecently/badge/nightly)](https://stackage.org/nightly/package/frecently)

  Extremely simple CLI tool for maintaining a [frecency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frecency) history.

  The intended use case is to add a frecency-based search history to CLI tools like [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/), [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi), or [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).
  It also allows you to easily emulate popular directory-jumping tools like [autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump) or [z](https://github.com/rupa/z).


  ### Examples

  We'll look at some examples of how to integrate `frecently` with other tools.
  For more detailed information, run `frecently --help`.

  #### Basic CLI:

  ```console
  $ frecently view .history      # .history doesn't exist yet. By default, all commands treat a missing file as empty
  $ frecently bump .history foo  # creates .history, and bumps foo
  $ frecently bump .history bar
  $ frecently view .history      # `view` shows all entries, ordered by frecency
  bar
  foo
  $ echo -e "bar\nbaz" | frecently view .history --augment   # with --augment, frecently accepts extra entries on stdin (newline-separated) that should always appear in the output
  bar
  foo
  baz
  $ echo -e "foo\nbar\nbaz" | frecently scores .history --augment   # `scores` has the same interface as `view`, but shows the entire scores table
  weighted score  hourly          daily           monthly
    178.663539      0.985473        0.999390        0.999980      bar
    178.267277      0.983010        0.999286        0.999976      foo
      0.000000      0.000000        0.000000        0.000000      baz
  $ echo -e "bar\nbaz" | frecently view .history --augment --restrict  # with --restrict, we exclusively output entries that appear on stdin
  bar
  baz
  ```

  #### `dmenu` web searches with history

  This bash script shows how easily `frecently` integrates with tools like `dmenu`:

  ```bash
  set -eo pipefail
  HISTORY=~/.search-history
  QUERY=$(frecently view $HISTORY | dmenu -p "Web search:")

  if [[ -n "$QUERY" ]]; then
    frecently bump "$HISTORY" "$QUERY"
    xdg-open "https://www.duckduckgo.com/?q=$QUERY"
  fi
  ```

  #### Directory picker

  In this more complicated bash script, we use `frecently` and `dmenu` to first ask the user for a directory, and then open a terminal in that directory.
  It shows a good use-case for `--augment` (`-a`), augmenting the list with any non-hidden directory at most 2 deep from `$HOME`.

  ```bash
  set -eo pipefail
  HISTORY=~/.directory-history
  # First, purge non-existent directories from the history
  for dir in $(frecently view $HISTORY); do
    if [ ! -d "$dir" ]; then
      echo "Removing $dir"
      frecently delete $HISTORY "$dir"
    fi
  done
  # Load the history, augmenting it with every non-hidden directory at most 2 deep from $HOME.
  DIR=$(find $HOME -maxdepth 2 -type d -not -path '*/.*' | frecently view $HISTORY -a | dmenu -i)
  if [ -d $DIR ]; then
    frecently bump $HISTORY "$DIR"
    $TERMCMD -d "$DIR"
  fi
  ```

  This kind of script is especially useful when combined with a shell hook that bumps on every directory change, to get `autojump`-like behavior.
  For `fish`, that looks like this:

  ```fish
  function __frecently-directory-hook --on-variable PWD --description 'bump current directory in history'
    frecently bump /path/to/history/file "$PWD"
  end
  ```

  ### Installation

  #### Binaries

  The [GitHub Action CI](https://github.com/jonascarpay/frecently/actions) builds static binaries for x86 and aarch64, so look for the artifacts there.
  If this project gains traction (stars) I'll add proper releases so the artifacts don't get deleted after 90 days.

  #### Compiling from source

  `frecently` can be built using a Haskell build tool, or using Nix.

  Using Cabal, run `cabal build`.

  Using Nix, the `flake.nix` file exposes the executable both directly and as an overlay.

  ### Implementation details

  `frecently` works by maintaining three energy levels per entry.
  The energy levels decay exponentially, with half-lives of an hour, a day, and a month, respectively.
  We `bump` an entry by adding 1 to each of these.

  An entry's frecency score is calculated by multiplying each of these three energies by a weight.
  The weights default to 720, 30, and 1, for the hourly, daily, and monthly energies, respectively, but can be overridden on the CLI.

  Energies are updated _only_ when the history file is used in a `bump` or `touch` command, and when we do, we update every entry's energy simultaneously.
  This is invisible to the user, but it ensures that we only need to calculate decay factors once when opening a file, making score calculations very efficient.

  When, during an update, an entry's monthly energy drops below the threshold value (defaults to 0.1), it is deleted from the history.
  If you don't want items to be deleted, use a threshold of 0.

  ### Comparison with other tools

  This tool was inspired by [frece](https://github.com/YodaEmbedding/frece).
  I really like the idea behind `frece`, but I think the execution is more complicated than it needs to be.
  `frecently` is both simpler and easier to integrate into CLI applications.
