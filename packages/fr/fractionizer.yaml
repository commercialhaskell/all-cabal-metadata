description: "# Mathematical problem solution\n\nLet's consider the problem of decomposition
  (approximation) of fractions\nthat lie in the range from 0 to 1 by the sum of two
  fractions with 1 in\nthe numerators (so called unit fractions) and, possibly, natural,\nunequal
  numbers in the denominators.\n\nWe will consider one of the two denominators to
  be a natural number,\nsmaller than the other number in the denominator, and we will
  look for\nsuch a pair of numbers that, when rounded to natural numbers, will give\nthe
  minimum absolute error of the resulting approximation.\nMathematically, this leads
  to a problem and its further solution below.\n\nMore is by the link in the package
  description.\n\n# Relation to music rhythm and meter \n\nIt can be used to produce
  music by approximation of the meter. This\nleaeds to interesting structures.\n\nIt
  also is directly connected to the irrational time signatures in music.\n\n# Acknowledgements
