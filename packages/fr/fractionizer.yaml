description: "# Mathematical problem solution {#mathematical-problem-solution .unnumbered}\n\nLet's
  consider the problem of decomposition (approximation) of fractions\nthat lie in
  the range from 0 to 1 by the sum of two fractions with 1 in\nthe numerators (so
  called unit fractions) and, possibly, natural,\nunequal numbers in the denominators.\n\nWe
  will consider one of the two denominators to be a natural number,\nsmaller than
  the other number in the denominator, and we will look for\nsuch a pair of numbers
  that, when rounded to natural numbers, will give\nthe minimum absolute error of
  the resulting approximation.\nMathematically, this leads to a problem and its further
  solution below.\n\n$$\\dfrac{1}{a} + \\dfrac{1}{b} = k,\\quad k,\\,b \\in \\mathrm{R},\\;
  a \\in \\mathrm{N},\\; 0 < k < 1,\\; b>0,\\, a < b$$\n\n$$\\dfrac{1}{a} + \\dfrac{1}{b}
  = k = \\dfrac{a+b}{ab}>\\dfrac{2}{a+b}=\\dfrac{1}{\\dfrac{a+b}{2}}$$\n\n$$b=\\dfrac{a}{ka-1}$$\n\nLogically,
  there are possible two situations, but the first one (the two\nequations below)
  leads to the contradiction with the idea of\napproximation, so we use the second
  option.\n\n$$1<a<\\dfrac{1}{k}<b$$ $$1 < b < 0,\\quad \\emptyset$$\n\nThe second
  option is below:\n\n$$1 < \\dfrac{1}{k}<a<b$$\n\nLet's consider the following option
  and prove that it leads to no\nsolutions.\n\n$$a \\geq \\dfrac{2}{k}$$ $$\\dfrac{1}{a}
  \\leq \\dfrac{k}{2}$$\n$$\\dfrac{1}{b} \\geq k - \\dfrac{k}{2} = \\dfrac{k}{2}$$\n$$a
  < b \\leq \\dfrac{2}{k} \\leq a,\\quad \\emptyset$$\n\nThis contradiction above
  proves that we should seek for solution using\nthe following:\n\n$$a \\in \\left[\\left[\\dfrac{1}{k}\\right]+1,\\ldots
  ,\\; \\left[\\dfrac{2}{k}\\right]\\right], \\;  b = \\dfrac{a}{ka - 1}$$\nFor the
  solutions above there is a criterion of their usability below:\n\n$$b = na, n \\geq
  1$$ $$na = \\dfrac{a}{ka-1}$$\n$$a=\\dfrac{n+1}{kn}<\\left[\\dfrac{2}{k}\\right]$$\n$$n>\\dfrac{1}{\\left[\\dfrac{2}{k}\\right]\\cdot
  k - 1}$$\n\n# Relation to music rhythm and meter {#relation-to-music-rhythm-and-meter
  .unnumbered}\n\nIt can be used to produce music by approximation of the meter. This\nleaeds
  to interesting structures, that have some commonality with the\nstructures, which
  are written about in the work [@link1994long].\n\nIt also is directly connected
  to the irrational time signatures in music\n(see: [@wheatley2019use]).\n\n# Acknowledgements
