synopsis: Allows to approximate the fractional numbers in the range [0.005, 1) or
  better [0.005, sqrt (2/3)] with sum of two unit fractions of special types.
changelog: "# Revision history for fractionizer\n\n## 0.1.0.0 -- 2023-04-19\n\n* First
  version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n## 0.1.0.1 -- 2023-04-19\n\n* First
  version revised A. Fixed incorrectly looking README.md.\n\n## 0.2.0.0 -- 2023-04-20\n\n*
  Second version. Fixed mathematical incompleteness in the solution that led to the
  reformulation\nof the problem itself. Now the solution is mathematically correct.
  See the changed link to the\ndraft article in the package description. Changed the
  source code accordingly.\n\n## 0.3.0.0 -- 2023-04-20\n\n* Third version. Removed
  the unneeded parameter that is needed just for theoretical proof and\n  solution
  finding (see the related draft paper). Some code simplifications.\n\n## 0.4.0.0
  -- 2023-04-20\n\n* Fourth version. Fixed mathematical inaccuracy that led to the
  solution with possible two equal\n  after rounding denominators. See the pdf file
  in the description for more information.\n\n## 0.5.0.0 -- 2023-04-21\n\n* Fifth
  version. Fixed mathematical inaccuracy that lead to incorrect solution.\n\n## 0.6.0.0
  -- 2023-04-21 \n\n* Sixth version. Fixed mathematical inaccuracy, added new functionality
  according to the \npaper.\n\n"

description: "# Mathematical problem solution\n\nLet's consider the problem of decomposition
  (approximation) of fractions\nthat lie in the range [0.005, 2/3)  by the sum of
  two fractions with 1 in\nthe numerators (so called unit fractions) and, possibly,
  natural,\nunequal numbers in the denominators.\n\nWe will consider one of the two
  denominators to be a natural number,\nsmaller than the other number in the denominator,
  and we will look for\nsuch a pair of numbers that, when rounded to natural numbers,
  will give\nthe minimum absolute error of the resulting approximation.\nMathematically,
  this leads to a problem and its further solution below.\n\nMore is by the link in
  the package description.\n\n# Relation to music rhythm and meter \n\nIt can be used
  to produce music by approximation of the meter. \nThis leads to interesting structures.\n\nIt
  also is directly connected to the irrational time signatures in music.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nAuthor
