  # Revision history for fractionizer

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2023-04-19

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  ## 0.1.0.1 -- 2023-04-19

  * First version revised A. Fixed incorrectly looking README.md.

  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2023-04-20

  * Second version. Fixed mathematical incompleteness in the solution that led to the reformulation
  of the problem itself. Now the solution is mathematically correct. See the changed link to the
  draft article in the package description. Changed the source code accordingly.

description: "# Mathematical problem solution\n\nLet's consider the problem of decomposition
  (approximation) of fractions\nthat lie in the range [0.005, 2/3)  by the sum of
  two fractions with 1 in\nthe numerators (so called unit fractions) and, possibly,
  natural,\nunequal numbers in the denominators.\n\nWe will consider one of the two
  denominators to be a natural number,\nsmaller than the other number in the denominator,
  and we will look for\nsuch a pair of numbers that, when rounded to natural numbers,
  will give\nthe minimum absolute error of the resulting approximation.\nMathematically,
  this leads to a problem and its further solution below.\n\nMore is by the link in
  the package description.\n\n# Relation to music rhythm and meter \n\nIt can be used
  to produce music by approximation of the meter. This\nleaeds to interesting structures.\n\nIt
  also is directly connected to the irrational time signatures in music.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nAuthor
