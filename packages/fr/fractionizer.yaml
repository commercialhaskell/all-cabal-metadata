  better [0.005, sqrt (2/3)] with sum of two unit fractions of special types.
changelog: "# Revision history for fractionizer\n\n## 0.1.0.0 -- 2023-04-19\n\n* First
  version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n## 0.1.0.1 -- 2023-04-19\n\n* First
  version revised A. Fixed incorrectly looking README.md.\n\n## 0.2.0.0 -- 2023-04-20\n\n*
  Second version. Fixed mathematical incompleteness in the solution that led to the
  reformulation\nof the problem itself. Now the solution is mathematically correct.
  See the changed link to the\ndraft article in the package description. Changed the
  source code accordingly.\n\n## 0.3.0.0 -- 2023-04-20\n\n* Third version. Removed
  the unneeded parameter that is needed just for theoretical proof and\n  solution
  finding (see the related draft paper). Some code simplifications.\n\n## 0.4.0.0
  -- 2023-04-20\n\n* Fourth version. Fixed mathematical inaccuracy that led to the
  solution with possible two equal\n  after rounding denominators. See the pdf file
  in the description for more information.\n\n## 0.5.0.0 -- 2023-04-21\n\n* Fifth
  version. Fixed mathematical inaccuracy that lead to incorrect solution.\n\n## 0.6.0.0

description: "# Mathematical problem solution\n\nLet's consider the problem of decomposition
  (approximation) of fractions\nthat lie in the range [0.005, 1)  by the sum of two
  fractions with 1 in\nthe numerators (so called unit fractions) and, possibly, natural,\nunequal
  numbers in the denominators.\n\nWe will consider one of the two denominators to
  be a natural number,\nsmaller than the other number in the denominator, and we will
  look for\nsuch a pair of numbers that, when rounded to natural numbers, will give\nthe
  minimum absolute error of the resulting approximation.\nMathematically, this leads
  to a problem and its further solution below.\n\nFinally, we can decompose (approximate)
  the 1 by the sum of 2, 3, 4, 5 or more unit fractions, with likely different denominators,
  just as like in the Egyptian mathematics.\n\nIn relation to music, this means that
  we can create rhythmic patterns using these unit fractions by treating the 1 as
  the music bar (notes between two consequtive barlines), but this leads to patterns
  that use irrational music meters and together to slightly different (hopefully,
  not perceptible) from 1 summary duration.\n\nThe tests show that there are some
  numerical instability for the numbers with more digits after the dot. So we use
  just 3 digits as correct after the dot.\n\nMore is by the link in the package description.\n\n#
  Relation to music rhythm and meter \n\nIt can be used to produce music by approximation
  of the meter. \nThis leads to interesting structures.\n\nIt also is directly connected
  to the irrational time signatures in music.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nAuthor would
