  * Breaking Change (from 0.1.0.2):  Some streaming functions
  use the ```StrictReadRec``` class, a stricter version of
  ```ReadRec``` from Frames. This class is located in
  Frames.Streamly.CSV.

  This library contains some useful functions for using the
  [Frames](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Frames)
  package with [streamly](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streamly).

  Frames has some built-in dependencies on the
  [Pipes](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes) package,
  a few of which--primarily file I/O-- require users of Frames to use
  the Pipes package explicitly.  Streamly provides much of the same
  functionality as Pipes and may be some users preferred streaming
  interface.

  This package replicates all the external-facing bits of Frames that
  rely on Pipes and uses streamly instead.  It also fleshes out the Frames
  API in a couple of places:

  1. It adds some flexibility to the functions to write CSV files.
  Frames supported formatting of fields for CSV
  via a typeclass ```ShowCSV```.  That is supported here as well.  But
  this package also supports using the ```Show``` instance, and, for more
  customized formatting,
  creating field-by-field formatting on the fly via
  a [Vinyl](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vinyl) record of functions.
  Helpful combinators are provided for formatting any single field with
  a ```Show``` instance or a ```ShowCSV``` instance or a user provided
  function from the field type to ```Text```.

  2. It adds some (experimental) support for ```Frame``` transformations
  using Streamly streams as an intermediate state for transformations
  which may benefit from the concurrency available in streamly. Such
  transformations first make any foldable of Records
  (including a ```Frame```) into a stream, apply a streamly transformation
  to a stream of some other records and then transforms those into a frame.
  So the result is a frame -> frame function but one that can take advantage
  of streamly's features at the cost of the transformation into a stream and then
  back in to a Frame.
  This allows use of the concurrent features of
  Streamly for functions like ```mapM``` or ```mapMaybeM```.

  3. It adds Streamly folds for the various stream to in-core
  transformations in case users want to use them directly
  in stream to Frame transformations.  Frames exposed only the functions
  to transform an entire stream (a pipe producer) into Frames "AoS"
  structure.  This library provides that functionality as well, in this case
  using streamly streams as the input.
  But here we also expose streamly folds from streams of
  Records to Frames so that more complex stream to Frame transformations
  can be done by the user.  For example, suppose you are doing
  a map/reduce on a large data set and you want to store the
  grouped subsets as Frames for memory-efficiency.  These folds
  make that simpler.
