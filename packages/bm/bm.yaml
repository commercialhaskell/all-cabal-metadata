  # `bm-haskell` Changelog

  This project follows the [Haskell package versioning policy][PVP], with
  versions in `A.B.C.D` format.  `A` may be incremented arbitrarily for
  non-technical reasons, but [semantic versioning][SemVer] is otherwise
  followed, where `A.B` is the major version, `C` is the minor version, and `D`
  is the patch version.  Initial development uses versions `0.0.0.D`, for which
  every version is considered breaking.

  [PVP]: <https://pvp.haskell.org/>
  [SemVer]: <https://semver.org/>

  The format of this changelog is based on [Keep a Changelog][KaC], with the
  following conventions:

  * Level-two heading `Unreleased` is used to track changes that have not been
    released.
  * Other level-two headings specify the release in `A.B.C.D (YYYY-MM-DD)`
    format, with newer versions above older versions.
  * Level-three headings are used to categorize changes as follows:
      1. Breaking
      2. Non-Breaking
  * Changes are listed in arbitrary order and present tense.

  [KaC]: <https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/>

  ### Non-Breaking

  ## Overview

  `bm` is a utility for opening bookmarks and queries from the command line.
  The bookmarks and queries are configured hierarchically in YAML, and they are
  referenced using keyword prefixes.  It allows you to quickly open bookmarks
  and perform search queries in your browser using only your keyboard.

  ## CLI

  ### Requirements

  `bm` is designed to work on any operating system, but it has only been tested
  on Linux.

  ### Installation

  #### `.deb` Package Installation

  Check the [Releases][] page for `.deb` packages.

  [Releases]: <https://github.com/ExtremaIS/bm-haskell/releases>

  #### `.rpm` Package Installation

  Check the [Releases][] page for `.rpm` packages.

  #### Installation From Hackage

  Install `bm` from [Hackage][] using [Cabal][] as follows:

  ```
  $ cabal v2-install bm
  ```

  [Hackage]: <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bm>
  [Cabal]: <https://www.haskell.org/cabal/>

  #### Installation From Stackage

  Install `bm` from [Stackage][] using [Stack][] as follows:

  ```
  $ stack install bm
  ```

  [Stackage]: <https://www.stackage.org/package/bm>
  [Stack]: <https://haskellstack.org/>

  ### Usage

  Bookmarks and search queries are configured using a hierarchy of keywords in a
  YAML configuration file.  They are selected using keyword prefixes as
  command-line arguments.  Command-line completion is available for Bash.  See
  the [`bm` man page](doc/bm.1.md) for details.

  Note that the command used to open bookmarks and queries can be customized in
  the configuration file.  Specifying the command for your specific browser can
  make links open considerably faster than with the default (generic) command.

  #### Examples

  An example configuration file is available in the `config` directory on
  GitHub (example for the latest release: [bm.yaml][]).  The following are
  example commands using this configuration file.

  Open a bookmark link by specifying keywords.  The Nix homepage can be opened
  with the following command:

  ```
  $ bm nix
  ```

  The `nixpkgs` manual can be opened using the following command:

  ```
  $ bm nix pkgs manual
  ```

  Keyword prefixes can also be used.  The following command also opens the
  `nixpkgs` manual:

  ```
  $ bm n p m
  ```

  When more than one keyword has the same prefix, the first is selected.  If a
  selected bookmark does not specify a URL, the first child is processed.

  The `/` keyword defines a bookmark with a URL as well as a query.  When no
  query is specified, the URL is opened, allowing you to search with suggestions
  using the search field.  Open a query by specifying keywords followed by the
  query.

  ```
  $ bm / LinearTypes
  ```

  When multiple query arguments are provided, they are joined with a space.
