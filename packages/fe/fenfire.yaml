description: "===================\nFenfire version 0.1\n===================\n\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nFenfire
  is a graph-based notetaking system. (We're planning to add a\nkitchen sink soon.)
  It is developed on the channel #fenfire on the\nFreenode IRC network.\n\n\nThe source
  code is available using Darcs.\n    darcs get http://antti-juhani.kaijanaho.fi/darcs/fenfire-hs\n\n\nRequirements
  for compilation\n============================\n\nFenfire source code\n\nDependencies
  with known-to-work version numbers:\n\n  ghc    6.6    (The Glorious Glasgow Haskell
  Compilation System)\n  gtk2hs 0.9.11 (A GUI library for Haskell based on Gtk, release
  candidate ok)\n  raptor 1.4.9  (Raptor RDF Parser Toolkit)\n  c2hs   0.14.5 (C->Haskell,
  An Interface Generator for Haskell)\n  harp   0.2    (Haskell Regular Patterns,
  in haskell-src-exts)\n  haxml  1.13.2 (Haskell and XML)\n  happy  1.15   (The Parser
  Generator for Haskell)\n  alex   2.0.1  (A lexical analyser generator for Haskell)\n\n(Packages
  in Debian: ghc6 libghc6-gtk-dev libraptor1-dev c2hs libghc6-harp-dev \n libghc6-haxml-dev
  happy alex)\n\n\nRunning a precompiled binary only requires:\ngmp             (The
  GNU MP Bignum Library)\ngtk             (The GIMP Toolkit)\nraptor          (Raptor
  RDF Parser Toolkit)\n\n(Packages in Debian: libgmp3c2 libgtk2.0-0 libraptor1)\n\n\nCompiling
  and running\n=====================\n\nFenfire-hs is packaged using the Haskell Cabal,
  which means you can use the \nfollowing commands to configure, build, and install
  it to your home directory:\n\nrunhaskell Setup.hs configure --user --prefix ~\nrunhaskell
  Setup.hs build\nrunhaskell Setup.hs install\n\nAfter this, you can start the application
  like this:\n\n~/bin/fenfire\n\nYou will see the application launch with a new graph
  where you can\nstart adding your notes using the Edit menu and the included key
  bindings.\n\n* The current node is highlighted in blue.\n\n* To write into the current
  node, move to the text box at the bottom\n  of the window using Tab or the mouse.
  After you've finished typing,\n  use Tab or the mouse to get back to the graph box.\n\n*
  Use the Edit menu or the keybindings indicated in the Edit menu to\n  - create new
  nodes\n  - mark the current node, or connect the current node to the\n    previously
  marked node(s)\n  - break connections between nodes\n\n* Use the arrow keys to move
  between nodes:\n  - Left and Right move to the node directly left or directly right\n
  \   from the current node.\n  - Up and Down scroll through the nodes connected to
  the current node.\n  - Instead of Left/Right/Up/Down, you can also use j/l/i/comma.\n\nYou
  cannot currently use the mouse to move around the structure.\n"
