  - new 'leaves' commands to list outer leaf packages
  - new 'roots' commands lists lowest dependencies
  - new library exposed with 2 modules: low-level Graph and high-level Order:
    - Distribution.RPM.Build.Order provides: dependencySort, dependencySortParallel,
      dependencyLayers, sortGraph output
    - Distribution.RPM.Build.Graph provides: createGraph, dependencyNodes,
      subgraph', packageLayers, etc

    and no longer carry redundant dependency lists
  - add a basic testsuite for the library

  # 0.3.1 (2020-07-04)
  - fix detection of circular dependencies (bug introduced in 0.3)

  # 0.3 (2019-10-10)

  # rpmbuild-order

  This is a tool to sort RPM source packages in build dependency order.
  The code was originally derived from
  [cabal-sort](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-sort)
  by Henning Thielemann.

  ## Usage

  ```
  $ rpmbuild-order --version
  0.4.10
  $ rpmbuild-order --help
  Order packages by build dependencies

  Usage: rpmbuild-order [--version] COMMAND
    Sort package sources (spec files) in build dependency order

  Available options:
    -h,--help                Show this help text
    --version                Show version

  Available commands:
    sort                     sort packages
    deps                     sort dependencies in neighbouring package dirs
    rdeps                    sort dependents in neighbouring package dirs
    layers                   ordered output of dependency layers
    chain                    ordered output suitable for a chain-build
    leaves                   List of the top leaves of package graph
    roots                    List lowest root packages
    render                   Show graph with graphviz

  $ rpmbuild-order sort mycore mylib myapp
  mylib mycore myapp
  ```

  The arguments passed can either be directories containing the package
  or spec files.

  If the dependency graph has cycles then an error will be output with
  a list of cycles and any shortest path subcycles.

  Using the rpmbuild-order `deps` and `rdeps` commands the ordered
  dependencies and reverse dependencies of a package can be obtained
  within the current set of checked out package sources.
  ie If you have a directory with packages:
  `pkg1/ pkg2/ lib1/ lib2/ lib3/ misc1/`
  then the output of `rpmbuild-order deps pkg1` might be `lib1 lib3 pkg1`
  for example.

  The `render` command displays a graph of package dependencies
  using graphviz and X11 or can print the dot format to stdout.

  ## Library
  As of version 0.4, a library is also provided.

  There are two modules:

  - `Distribution.RPM.Build.Order` provides higher level functions for
    sorting packages in build dependency orders and output. It is built on top of:
  - `Distribution.RPM.Build.Graph` provides lower level functions for generating
    RPM dependency graphs

  Please see their documentation for more details.

  ## Notes and known problems
  1. Given packages A, B, C, where C depends on B, and B depends on A,
  and you call

         rpmbuild-order sort C.spec A.spec

     then the output may be wrong if C does not have a direct dependency on A.
     Even if the order is correct, B is missing in the output
     and thus in this case the list of packages cannot be reliably used
     for a sequence of builds.

     However the `deps` and `rdeps` commands take
     other neighbouring package directories into account.

  2. repoquery is not used to resolve meta-dependencies or files to packages.
  So if a package BuildRequires a file, it will not be resolved to a package.
  This may get addressed some day, but file dependencies seem uncommon for
  BuildRequires compared to Requires.

  3. rpmspec is used to parse spec files (for macro expansion etc):
  so missing macros packages can lead to erroneous results in some cases.

  4. Since version 0.4.6 there is some support now for packages using
  dynamic buildrequires (in Fedora: golang, python, ruby, and rust packages).

  5. Since version 0.4.8 %{_isa} suffixed Provides are filtered out for x86_64.

  ## Installation

  rpmbuild-order is packaged in Fedora Linux.

  ## Building from source

  Use `cabal-rpm builddep && cabal install` or `stack install`.
