  # rpm-nvr

  Currently this library provides some types for RPM NVRs:
  NV, NVR, NVRA, VerRel with read and display functions.
  There is also an ordering of VerRel based on rpm's vercmp
  which is implemented as rpmVerCompare.

  See the haddock documentation for more details.

  The testsuite includes testcases for comparing rpm versions
  from the main rpm project.
