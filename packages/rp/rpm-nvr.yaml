  # rpm-nvr

  Currently this library provides some types for RPM NVRs:
  NV, NVR, NVRA, VerRel with read and display functions.
  There is also an ordering of VerRel based on rpm's vercmp
  which is implemented as rpmVerCompare.

  See the haddock documentation for more details.

  rpm-nvr is distributed under the GPLv2+ license.

  The testsuite includes testcases for comparing rpm versions
  from the main rpm project.
