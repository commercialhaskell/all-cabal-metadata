  # cppfilt

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/0xd34df00d/cppfilt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/0xd34df00d/cppfilt)

  This library provides bindings to the system ABI-exposed C++ name demangling
  routines. It provides both `IO`-based API in the `System.Demangle` module
  and the pure one in `System.Demangle.Pure`. The latter is deduced as unsafe
  due to `unsafePerformIO` (which should be fine, though, since demangling is
  hopefully referentially transparent).


  ## Supported systems

  For now demangling is done using either `libstdc++` or `libc++` (controlled
  via the `use-libcpp` build flag). Adding support for other ABIs in a similar
  fashion should be easy.

  This approach is probably suboptimal, though, since one might want to try
  different ABIs that might be available simultaneously (since even clang and
  gcc mangle some names slightly differently), but it's not entirely obvious
  what the API should be like in this case.
