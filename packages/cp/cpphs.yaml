  ------------
    * Accept -U cmdline option for compatibility with cpp.

  Version 1.12
  ------------
    * Allow it to build with ghc-7.2.

  Version 1.11
  ------------
    * API change: runCpphs, cppIfdef, and macroPass are now in the IO monad.

  Version 1.10
  -----------
    * New command-line option: "--linepragma"
      It converts #line droppings into {-# LINE #-}.

  Version 1.9
  -----------
    * Bugfix for #undef.

  Version 1.8
  -----------
    * Bugfix for off-by-one error in line numbers with --include=file.

  Version 1.7
  -----------
    * Bugfix in interaction of --unlit with \end{code}

  Version 1.6
  -----------
    * New command-line option: "--include=filename".
    * New command-line option: "--strip-eol" for comment-stripping.
    * Line pragmas can have filenames containing spaces.

  Version 1.5
  -----------
    * Parametrised macro-calls now permitted in #ifdef's.
    * Recursive textual expansion now permitted in #ifdef's.
    * Better options-handling when used as a library.
    * Various small bugfixes

  Version 1.4
  -----------
    * Added a "--pragma" option to retain #pragma in the output.
    * Fixed a number of obscure corner cases involving the interaction of
      multiple features e.g. foo##__LINE__.
    * Added the "--nowarn" option.

  Version 1.3
  -----------
    * Added a "--cpp" option for drop-in compatibility with standard cpp.
      It causes cpphs to accept standard cpp flags and translate
      them to cpphs equivalents.  Compatibility options include: -o, -ansi,
      -traditional, -stdc, -x, -include, -P, -C, -CC, -A.  The file
      behaviour is different too - if two filenames are given on the
      commandline, then the second is treated as the output location.
    * Fixed a corner-case bug in evaluating chained and overlapping #ifdefs.

  Version 1.2
  -----------
    * Re-arranged the source files into hierarchical libraries.
    * Exposed the library interface as an installable Cabal package, with
      Haddock documentation.
    * Added the --unlit option, for removing literate-style comments.

  Version 1.1
  -----------
    * Fix the .cabal way of building cpphs.
    * Update the --version reported (forgotten in 1.0, which still reports 0.9)
    * No longer throws an error when given an empty file as input.

  Version 1.0
  -----------
    * Add a compatibility script cpphs.compat, allowing cpphs to act as
      a drop-in replacement for cpp, e.g.
          ghc -cpp -pgmP cpphs.compat
    * Place quotes around replacements for special macros __FILE__, __DATE__,
      and __TIME__.
    * If no files are specified, read from stdin.
    * Ignore #! lines (e.g. in scripts)
    * Parse -D commandline options once only, and consistently with cpp,
      i.e. -Dfoo means foo=1
    * Fix compatibility with preprocessors like hsc2hs, which use
      non-cpp directives like #def.  They are now passed through to the
      output with a warning to stderr.

  Version 0.9
  -----------
    * Bugfix for ghc-6.4 -O: flush the output buffer.

  Version 0.8
  -----------
    * Added the --text option, to signify the input should not
      be lexed as Haskell.  This causes macros to be defined or expanded
      regardless of their location within comments, string delimiters, etc.
    * Shuffle a few files around to make it easier to say 'hmake cpphs'.
      There is also now a runhugs script to invoke cpphs nicely.

  Version 0.7
  -----------
    * Enable the __FILE__, __LINE__, __DATE__, and __TIME__ specials, which
      can be useful for creating DIY error messages.

  Version 0.6
  -----------
    * Recognise and ignore the #pragma cpp directive.
    * Fix beginning-of-file bug, where in --noline mode, a # cpp directive
      at the top of the file appeared in the output.
    * Fix chained parenthesised boolean exprs in #if, e.g.
          #if ( foo ) && ( bar )
    * Fix precedence in chained unparenthesised boolean exprs in #if, e.g.
          #if foo && bar || baz && frob
    * For better compatibility with cpp, and because otherwise
      there are certain constructs that cannot be expressed, we no
      longer permit whitespace in a <tt>#define</tt> between the
      symbolname and an opening parenthesis, e.g.
          #define f (f' id)
      Previously, this was interpreted as a parametrised macro,
      with arguments in the parens, and no expansion.  Now, the space
      indicates that this is a textual replacement, and the parenthesised
      expression is in fact the replacement.

  Version 0.5
  -----------
    * Added a --version flag to report the version number.
    * Renamed --stringise to --hashes, and use it to turn on ## catenation
      as well.
    * Bugfix for #if 1, previously taken as false.
    * Bugfix for --nolines: it no longer adds extra spurious newlines.
    * File inclusion now looks in the directory of the calling file.
    * Failure to find an include file is now merely a warning to stderr
      rather than an error.
    * Added a --layout flag.  Previously, line continuations in a macro
      definition were always preserved in the output, permitting use
      of the Haskell layout rule even inside a macro.  The default is now
      to remove line continuations for conformance with cpp, but the option
      of using --layout is still possible.

  Version 0.4
  -----------
    * New flag -Ofile to redirect output
    * Bugfix for precedence in   #if !False && False
    * Bugfix for whitespace between # and if
    * Bugfix for #define F "blah"; #include F

  Version 0.3
  -----------
    * Bugfix for recursive macro expansion.
    * New flag --strip to remove C comments even outside cpp directives.
    * New flag --stringise to recognise the # stringise operator in macros.

  Version 0.2
  -----------
    * New flag --noline to eliminate #line directives from output.
    * Add symbol-replacement and macro-expansion.
    * New flag --nomacro to turn off symbol/macro-expansion.

  2004-Apr-21
  -----------
    * Now accept multi-line # commands via the \ line continuation operator.
      The original file line numbering is preserved in the output by
      some tricky acrobatics.

  Version 0.1
  -----------
    * Initial release.

  cpphs
  =====

  A liberalised re-implementation of `cpp`, the C pre-processor.

  `cpphs` is a re-implementation of the C pre-processor that is both more compatible with Haskell,
  and itself written in Haskell so that it can be distributed with compilers.

  This version of the C pre-processor is pretty-much feature-complete and compatible with traditional (K&R) pre-processors.
  Additional features include: a plain-text mode; an option to unlit literate code files; and an option to turn off macro-expansion.

  Usage
  -----

      cpphs  [filename | -Dsym | -Dsym=val | -Ipath]+  [-Ofile]
             [ --include=file ]*
             [ --nomacro | --noline | --nowarn | --strip | --strip-eol |
               --pragma | --text | --hashes | --layout | --unlit |
               --linepragma ]*
             [ --cpp compatopts ]

  For fuller details, see [docs/index.html](docs/index.html).

  If you want to use `cpphs` as a completely drop-in replacement for the
  real cpp, that is, to accept the same arguments, and have broadly
  the same behaviour in response to them, then use the `--cpp` compatibility
  option.
