changelog: "# Revision History for cabal2nix\n\n## 2.19.0\n\nNote that some of the
  API has also changed in a breaking\nmanner because of the upgrade to [`distribution-nixpkgs`\n1.7.0](https://github.com/nixos/distribution-nixpkgs/blob/v1.7.0/CHANGELOG.md#170),\nsee
  [#506](https://github.com/NixOS/cabal2nix/pull/506).\n\n* Only use `hpack` when
  building if no cabal file is found\n  for the package to process.\n  See also [#508](https://github.com/NixOS/cabal2nix/pull/508).\n*
  `hackage2nix` now supports arbitrary Nix-style platform tuples\n  in `unsupported-platforms`
  (including the new `aarch64-darwin`) as\n  well as nixpkgs platform groups which
  are denoted as e. g.\n  `platforms.darwin` and can be used instead of platform tuples.\n
  \ See also [#506](https://github.com/NixOS/cabal2nix/pull/506).\n  **API breaking
  change**: The `IsString` instance for `Platform` in\n  `Distribution.Nixpkgs.Haskell.OrphanInstances`
  has been removed.\n* The new `hackage2nix` `supported-platforms` configuration field\n
  \ allows prescribing a specific list of platforms to set in the\n  package's `platforms`
  meta attribute. `unsupported-platforms`\n  are now translated to `badPlatforms`
  instead of being subtracted\n  from `platforms`.\n  See also [#506](https://github.com/NixOS/cabal2nix/pull/506)\n
  \ and [#560](https://github.com/NixOS/cabal2nix/pull/560).\n  **API Breaking Change**
  for\n  `Distribution.Nixpkgs.Haskell.FromCabal.Configuration`.\n* `cabal2nix` will
  no longer emit a dependency on `webkitgtk24x-gtk{2,3}`\n  if it detects the older
  3.0 API of WebKit being used. Nixpkgs hasn't\n  contained this package for a few
  years now due to security\n  vulnerabilities and the packages still using it on
  Hackage are\n  unmaintained. If you have a legacy project built with an old\n  version
  of nixpkgs, either don't upgrade `cabal2nix` or emulate\n  the old behavior using
  overrides.\n  See also [#521](https://github.com/NixOS/cabal2nix/pull/521).\n* If
  the input cabal file declares just a single executable, the `mainProgram`\n  meta
  attribute will be set in the resulting Nix expression.\n  See also [#506](https://github.com/NixOS/cabal2nix/pull/506)
  and\n  [#557](https://github.com/NixOS/cabal2nix/pull/557).\n* If `cabal2nix` (or
  `hackage2nix`) doesn't recognize the license\n  of a package, it'll still assume
  that it's free and enable building\n  on Hydra (i. e. use the default value of `hydraPlatforms`).\n
  \ This is done because Hackage requires uploaded packages to\n  be open source.
  You may need to keep this change in mind,\n  however, if you use `cabal2nix` for
  packaging unfree\n  software. See also [#520](https://github.com/NixOS/cabal2nix/pull/520).\n
  \ `isFreeLicense` has changed semantically as a result.\n* Argument parsing logic
  in `cabal2nix` has been refactored\n  in [#544](https://github.com/NixOS/cabal2nix/pull/544).\n
  \ **API breaking change** for the following modules:\n  \n  * `Cabal2nix`\n  * `Distribution.Nixpkgs.Fetch`\n
  \ * `Distribution.Nixpkgs.Haskell.Derivation` (removed instance)\n  * `Distribution.Nixpkgs.Haskell.PackageSourceSpec`\n*
  Update handling of Lua bindings to reflect current state upstream.\n  See [#527](https://github.com/NixOS/cabal2nix/pull/527)
  and\n  [#547](https://github.com/NixOS/cabal2nix/pull/547).\n\n## 2.18.0\n\n* Support
  GHC 9.0.x and Cabal 3.4.0.0,\n  **API breaking change**\n  (See [#503](https://github.com/NixOS/cabal2nix/pull/503))\n*
  Fix fetching remote _archives_: Previously they weren't properly\n  unpacked, **API
  breaking change**\n  (See [#455](https://github.com/NixOS/cabal2nix/pull/455))\n*
  Resolution of system dependency attribute names in nixpkgs\n  * Update changed upstream
  attribute names, reflect deprecations\n  * Fix hackage2nix not resolving certain
  attribute names if multiple\n    attribute names referred to the same derivation.\n
  \   (See [#492](https://github.com/NixOS/cabal2nix/pull/492) and\n    [distribution-nixpkgs#10](https://github.com/NixOS/distribution-nixpkgs/pull/10))\n*
  hackage2nix: accept multiple config files at the command\n  line given by specifying
  `--config` more than once\n  (See [#494](https://github.com/NixOS/cabal2nix/pull/494))\n"

  Cabal2nix
  =========

  [![hackage release](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/cabal2nix.svg?label=hackage)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal2nix)
  [![stackage LTS package](http://stackage.org/package/cabal2nix/badge/lts)](http://stackage.org/lts/package/cabal2nix)
  [![stackage Nightly package](http://stackage.org/package/cabal2nix/badge/nightly)](http://stackage.org/nightly/package/cabal2nix)
  ![Continous Integration](https://github.com/NixOS/cabal2nix/workflows/Haskell-CI/badge.svg)

  `cabal2nix` converts a single Cabal file into a single Nix build expression.
  For example:

  ```console
  $ cabal2nix cabal://mtl
  { mkDerivation, base, lib, transformers }:
  mkDerivation {
    pname = "mtl";
    version = "2.2.1";
    sha256 = "1icdbj2rshzn0m1zz5wa7v3xvkf6qw811p4s7jgqwvx1ydwrvrfa";
    libraryHaskellDepends = [ base transformers ];
    homepage = "http://github.com/ekmett/mtl";
    description = "Monad classes, using functional dependencies";
    license = lib.licenses.bsd3;
  }
  ```

  Cabal files can be referred to using the magic URL `cabal://NAME-VERSION`,
  which will automatically download the file from Hackage. Alternatively, a
  direct `http://host/path/pkg.cabal` URL can be provided, as well as a
  `file:///local/path/pkg.cabal` URI that doesn't depend on network access.
  However, if the source hash is not already in `cabal2nix`'s cache or provided
  using the `--sha256` option, `cabal2nix` still needs to download the source
  code to compute the hash, which still causes network traffic. Run the utility
  with `--help` to see the complete list of supported command-line flags.

  Detailed instructions on how to use those generated files with Nix can be found at
  https://haskell4nix.readthedocs.io/nixpkgs-users-guide.html#how-to-create-nix-builds-for-your-own-private-haskell-packages.

  `cabal2nix` can also build derivations for projects from other sources than
  Hackage. You only need to provide a URI that points to a cabal project. The
  most common use-case for this is probably to generate a derivation for a
  project on the local file system:

  ```console
  $ cabal get mtl-2.2.1 && cd mtl-2.2.1
  $ cabal2nix .
  { mkDerivation, base, lib, transformers }:
  mkDerivation {
    pname = "mtl";
    version = "2.2.1";
    src = ./.;
    libraryHaskellDepends = [ base transformers ];
    homepage = "http://github.com/ekmett/mtl";
    description = "Monad classes, using functional dependencies";
    license = lib.licenses.bsd3;
  }
  ```

  This derivation will not fetch from hackage, but instead use the directory which
  contains the derivation as the source repository.

  `cabal2nix` currently supports the following repository types:

  * directory
  * source archive (zip, tar.gz, ...) from http or https URL or local file.
  * git, mercurial, svn or bazaar repository

  ## `hackage2nix`

  This repository also contains, in the [`hackage2nix/`](./hackage2nix) directory,
  the tool to update the Haskell packages in
  [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs). It has its own README there.

  ## Building

  `cabal2nix` is built using [`cabal-install`](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/),
  like you'd expect, and you are free to use your favourite way of setting up
  a Haskell development environment.

  Since `cabal2nix` is quite intertwined with the packages `distribution-nixpkgs`
  and `hackage-db`, we recommend setting up a shared development environment
  for the three packages like so:

  ```console
  $ mkdir /path/to/cabal2nix-root && cd /path/to/cabal2nix-root
  $ # clone repositories, note that you may need to checkout an
  $ # older tag for some depending on breaking changes on master.
  $ git clone https://github.com/NixOS/cabal2nix.git
  $ git clone https://github.com/NixOS/hackage-db.git
  $ git clone https://github.com/NixOS/distribution-nixpkgs.git
  $ # setup development environment with shellFor
  $ cat > shell.nix << EOF
  # assumes nix{os,pkgs}-unstable
  { pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

  pkgs.haskellPackages.shellFor {
    packages = p: [
      p.cabal2nix-unstable
      p.distribution-nixpkgs
      p.hackage-db
    ];

    # for running doctests locally
    nativeBuildInputs = [
      pkgs.haskellPackages.doctest
    ];

    # set environment variable, so the development version of
    # distribution-nixpkgs finds derivation-attr-paths.nix
    distribution_nixpkgs_datadir = toString ./distribution-nixpkgs;
  }
  EOF
  $ # tell cabal about local packages
  $ cat > cabal.project << EOF
  packages: ./*/*.cabal
  EOF
  $ # test our new development environment
  $ nix-shell --run "cabal v2-build exe:cabal2nix exe:hackage2nix"
  ```
