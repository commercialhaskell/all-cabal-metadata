synopsis: A Setup.hs helper for doctests running
changelog: |
  # 1.0.7 -- 2019-??-??

  * Make `Distribution.Extra.Doctest` `-Wall`-clean
  * Support GHC-8.8, base-4.13, and Cabal-3.0

  # 1.0.6 -- 2018-01-28

  * Hook `haddock` build too. Fixes issue when `haddock` fails, as
    `Build_doctests` isn't generated.

  # 1.0.5 -- 2018-01-26

  * Add a hack so `Build_doctests` module is automatically added to
    to `other-modules` and `autogen-modules` when compiled with Cabal-2.0.
    Thanks to that, we don't get warnings because of `-Wmissing-home-modules`.

  # 1.0.4 -- 2017-12-05

  * Add support for doctests in executables and (with `Cabal-2.0` or later)
    internal libraries. Refer to the `README` for more details.

  # 1.0.3 -- 2017-11-02

  * Add an explicit `Prelude` import to `Build_doctests`

  # 1.0.2 -- 2017-05-16

  * Add `defaultMainAutoconfWithDoctests` and `addDoctestsUserHook`.

  * Add support for `.hsc` and other preprocessed files
    ([#8](https://github.com/phadej/cabal-doctest/issues/8))

  * Add support for `x-doctest-source-dirs` and `x-doctest-modules`.

  # 1.0.1 -- 2017-05-05

  * Add support for `x-doctest-options` cabal-file field

  * Proper support for GHC-8.2.1 & Cabal-2.0.0.0

  * Add support to `default-extensions` in library.

  # 1  -- 2017-01-31

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  cabal-doctest
  =============

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/cabal-doctest.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-doctest) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/phadej/cabal-doctest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/phadej/cabal-doctest)

  A `Setup.hs` helper for running `doctests`.

  Simple example
  --------------

  For most use cases—a `.cabal` file with a single library containing
  doctests—adapting the simple example located
  [here](https://github.com/phadej/cabal-doctest/tree/master/simple-example)
  will be sufficient. (Note that this example requires `Cabal-1.24` or later, but
  you can relax this bound safely, although running doctests won't be supported
  on versions of `Cabal` older than 1.24.)

  To use this library in your `Setup.hs`, you should specify a `custom-setup`
  section in your `.cabal` file. For example:

  ```
  custom-setup
   setup-depends:
     base >= 4 && <5,
     Cabal,
     cabal-doctest >= 1 && <1.1
  ```

  /Note:/ `Cabal` dependency is needed because of
  [Cabal/GH-4288](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/4288) bug.

  You'll also need to specify `build-type: Custom` at the top of the `.cabal`
  file. Now put this into your `Setup.hs` file:

  ```haskell
  module Main where

  import Distribution.Extra.Doctest (defaultMainWithDoctests)

  main :: IO ()
  main = defaultMainWithDoctests "doctests"
  ```

  When you build your project, this `Setup` will generate a `Build_doctests`
  module. To use it in a testsuite, simply do this:

  ```haskell
  module Main where

  import Build_doctests (flags, pkgs, module_sources)
  import Data.Foldable (traverse_)
  import Test.DocTest (doctest)

  main :: IO ()
  main = do
      traverse_ putStrLn args -- optionally print arguments
      doctest args
    where
      args = flags ++ pkgs ++ module_sources
  ```

  Example with multiple .cabal components
  ---------------------------------------

  `cabal-doctest` also supports more exotic use cases where a `.cabal` file
  contains more components with doctests than just the main library, including:

  * Doctests in executables
  * Doctests in Internal libraries (if using `Cabal-2.0` or later)

  Unlike the simple example shown above, these examples involve _named_
  components. You don't need to change the `Setup.hs` script to support
  this use case. However, in this scenario `Build_doctests` will generate extra
  copies of the `flags`, `pkgs`, and `module_sources` values for each additional
  named component.

  Simplest approach is to use `x-doctest-components` field, for example
  ```
  x-doctest-components: lib lib:internal exe:example
  ```

  In that case, the testdrive is general:

  ```haskell
  module Main where

  import Build_doctests (Component (..), components)
  import Data.Foldable (for_)
  import Test.DocTest (doctest)

  main :: IO ()
  main = for_ components $ \(Component name flags pkgs sources) -> do
      print name
      putStrLn "----------------------------------------"
      let args = flags ++ pkgs ++ sources
      for_ args putStrLn
      doctest args
  ```

  There's also a more explicit approach: if you have an executable named `foo`,
  then separate values named `flags_exe_foo`, `pkgs_exe_foo`, and `module_sources_exe_foo` will
  be generated in `Build_doctests`. If the name has hyphens in it
  (e.g., `my-exe`), then `cabal-doctest` will convert those hyphens to
  underscores (e.g., you'd get `flags_my_exe`, `pkgs_my_exe`, and
  `module_sources_my_exe`).
  Internal library `bar` values will have a `_lib_bar` suffix.

  An example testsuite driver for this use case might look like this:

  ```haskell
  module Main where

  import Build_doctests
         (flags,            pkgs,            module_sources,
          flags_exe_my_exe, pkgs_exe_my_exe, module_sources_exe_my_exe)
  import Data.Foldable (traverse_)
  import Test.DocTest

  main :: IO ()
  main = do
      -- doctests for library
      traverse_ putStrLn libArgs
      doctest libArgs

      -- doctests for executable
      traverse_ putStrLn exeArgs
      doctest exeArgs
    where
      libArgs = flags            ++ pkgs            ++ module_sources
      exeArgs = flags_exe_my_exe ++ pkgs_exe_my_exe ++ module_sources_exe_my_exe
  ```

  See
  [this example](https://github.com/phadej/cabal-doctest/tree/master/multiple-components-example)
  for more details.

  Additional configuration
  ------------------------

  The `cabal-doctest` based `Setup.hs` supports few extensions fields
  in `pkg.cabal` files to customise the `doctest` runner behaviour, without
  customising the default `doctest.hs`.

  ```
  test-suite doctests:
    if impl(ghc >= 8.0)
      x-doctest-options: -fdiagnostics-color=never
    x-doctest-source-dirs: test
    x-doctest-modules: Servant.Utils.LinksSpec

    ...
  ```

  * `x-doctest-options` Additional arguments passed into `doctest` command.
  * `x-doctest-modules` Additional modules to `doctest`. May be useful if you
    have `doctest` in test or executables (i.e not default library complonent).
  * `x-doctest-src-dirs` Additional source directories to look for the modules.

  Notes
  -----

  * Recent versions of `Cabal` (for instance, 2.0) can choose to build a
    package's `doctest` test suite _before_ the library. However, in order for
    `cabal-doctest` to work correctly, the library _must_ be built first, as
    `doctest` relies on the presence of generated files that are only created
    when the library is built. See
    [#19](https://github.com/phadej/cabal-doctest/issues/19).

    A hacky workaround for this problem is to depend on the library itself in a
    `doctests` test suite. See
    [the simple example's .cabal file](https://github.com/phadej/cabal-doctest/blob/master/simple-example/simple-example.cabal)
    for a demonstration. (This assumes that the test suite has the ability to
    read build artifacts from the library, a separate build component. In
    practice, this assumption holds, which is why this library works at all.)

  * `custom-setup` section is supported starting from `cabal-install-1.24`.
    For older `cabal-install's` you have to install custom setup dependencies
    manually.

  * `stack` respects `custom-setup` starting from version 1.3.3. Before that
    you have to use `explicit-setup-deps` setting in your `stack.yaml`.
    ([stack/GH-2094](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2094))

  * There is [an issue in the Cabal issue tracker](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/2327)
    about adding `cabal doctest` command. After that command is implemented,
    this library will be deprecated.

  * You can use `x-doctest-options` field in `test-suite doctests` to
    pass additional flags to the `doctest`.

  * For `build-type: Configure` packages, you can use
    `defaultMainAutoconfWithDoctests` function to make custom `Setup.hs` script.

  * If you use the default `.` in `hs-source-dirs`, then running `doctests`
    might fail with weird errors (ambiguous module errors). Workaround is
    to move sources under `src/` or some non-top-level directory.

  * `extensions:` field isn't supported. Upgrade your `.cabal` file to use at least
    `cabal-version: >= 1.10` and use `default-extensions` or `other-extensions`.

  * If you use QuickCheck properties (`prop>`) in your doctests,
    the `test-suite doctest` should depend on `QuickCheck` and `template-haskell`.
    This is a little HACK: These dependencies aren't needed to build the
    `doctests` test-suite executable.  However, as we let `Cabal` resolve
    dependencies, we can pass the resolved (and installed!) package identifiers to
    to the `doctest` command.  This way, `QuickCheck` and `template-haskell` are
    available to `doctest`, otherwise you'll get errors like:

  ```
      Variable not in scope:
        mkName
          :: [Char]
             -> template-haskell-2.11.1.0:Language.Haskell.TH.Syntax.Name
  ```

  or

  ```
      Variable not in scope:
        polyQuickCheck
          :: Language.Haskell.TH.Syntax.Name -> Language.Haskell.TH.Lib.ExpQ
  ```
