  Sun Jan 16 2005\n\n\t* Much thanks to all the awesome fptools hackers who have been\n\tworking
  hard to build the Haskell Cabal!\n\n\t* Interface Changes:\n\n\t** WARNING: this
  is a pre-release and the interfaces are still\n\tlikely to change until we reach
  a 1.0 release.\n\n\t** Instead of Package.description, you should name your\n\tdescription
  files <something>.cabal.  In particular, we suggest\n\tthat you name it <packagename>.cabal,
  but this is not enforced\n\t(yet).  Multiple .cabal files in the same directory
  is an error,\n\tat least for now.\n\n\t** ./setup install --install-prefix is gone.
  \ Use ./setup copy\n\t--copy-prefix instead.\n\n\t** The \"Modules\" field is gone.
  \ Use \"hidden-modules\",\n\t\"exposed-modules\", and \"executable-modules\".\n\n\t**
  Build-depends is now a package-only field, and can't go into\n\texecutable stanzas.
  \ Build-depends is a package-to-package\n\trelationship.\n\n\t** Some new fields.
  \ Use the Source.\n\n\t* New Features\n\n\t** Cabal is now included as a package
  in the CVS version of\n\tfptools.  That means it'll be released as \"-package Cabal\"
  in\n\tfuture versions of the compilers, and if you are a bleeding-edge\n\tuser,
  you can grab it from the CVS repository with the compilers.\n\n\t** Hugs compatibility
  and NHC98 compatibility should both be\n\timproved.\n\n\t** Hooks Interface / Autoconf
  compatibility: Most of the hooks\n\tinterface is hidden for now, because it's not
  finalized.  I have\n\texposed only \"defaultMainWithHooks\" and \"defaultUserHooks\".
  \ This\n\tallows you to use a ./configure script to preprocess\n\t\"foo.buildinfo\",
  which gets merged with \"foo.cabal\".  In future\n\treleases, we'll expose UserHooks,
  but we're definitely going to\n\tchange the interface to those.  The interface to
  the two functions\n\tI've exposed should stay the same, though.\n\n\t** ./setup
  haddock is a baby feature which pre-processes the\n\tsource code with hscpp and
  runs haddock on it.  This is brand new\n\tand hardly tested, so you get to knock
  it around and see what you\n\tthink.\n\n\t** Some commands now actually implement
  verbosity.\n\n\t** The preprocessors have been tested a bit more, and seem to work\n\tOK.
  \ Please give feedback if you use these.\n\n0.3  Isaac Jones  <ijones@syntaxpolice.org>
  Sun Jan 16 2005\n\t* Unstable snapshot release\n\t* From now on, stable releases
  are even.\n\n0.2  Isaac Jones  <ijones@syntaxpolice.org>\n\n\t* Adds more HUGS support
  and preprocessor support.\n"

  The Cabal library package
  =========================

  See the [Cabal web site] for more information.

  If you also want the `cabal` command-line program, you need the
  [cabal-install] package in addition to this library.

  [cabal-install]: ../cabal-install/README.md

  Installing the Cabal library
  ============================

  If you already have the `cabal` program
  ---------------------------------------

  In this case run:

      $ cabal install

  However, if you do not have an existing version of the `cabal` program,
  you first must install the Cabal library. To avoid this bootstrapping
  problem, you can install the Cabal library directly as described below.


  Installing as a user (no root or administrator access)
  ------------------------------------------------------

      ghc -threaded --make Setup
      ./Setup configure --user
      ./Setup build
      ./Setup install

  Note the use of the `--user` flag at the configure step.

  Compiling 'Setup' rather than using `runghc Setup` is much faster and
  works on Windows. For all packages other than Cabal itself, it is fine
  to use `runghc`.

  This will install into `$HOME/.cabal/` on Unix and into
  `Documents and Settings\$User\Application Data\cabal\` on Windows.
  If you want to install elsewhere, use the `--prefix=` flag at the
  configure step.


  Installing as root or Administrator
  -----------------------------------

      ghc -threaded --make Setup
      ./Setup configure
      ./Setup build
      sudo ./Setup install

  Compiling Setup rather than using `runghc Setup` is much faster and
  works on Windows. For all packages other than Cabal itself, it is fine
  to use `runghc`.

  This will install into `/usr/local` on Unix, and on Windows it will
  install into `$ProgramFiles/Haskell`. If you want to install elsewhere,
  use the `--prefix=` flag at the configure step.


  Using older versions of GHC and Cabal
  ======================================

  It is recommended that you leave any pre-existing version of Cabal
  installed. In particular, it is *essential* you keep the version that
  came with GHC itself, since other installed packages require it (for
  instance, the "ghc" API package).

  Prior to GHC 6.4.2, however, GHC did not deal particularly well with
  having multiple versions of packages installed at once. So if you are
  using GHC 6.4.1 or older and you have an older version of Cabal
  installed, you should probably remove it by running:

      $ ghc-pkg unregister Cabal

  or, if you had Cabal installed only for your user account, run:

      $ ghc-pkg unregister Cabal --user

  The `filepath` dependency
  =========================

  Cabal uses the [filepath] package, so it must be installed first.
  GHC version 6.6.1 and later come with `filepath`, however, earlier
  versions do not by default. If you do not already have `filepath`,
  you need to install it. You can use any existing version of Cabal to do
  that. If you have neither Cabal nor `filepath`, it is slightly
  harder but still possible.

  Unpack Cabal and `filepath` into separate directories. For example:

      tar -xzf filepath-1.1.0.0.tar.gz
      tar -xzf Cabal-1.6.0.0.tar.gz

      # rename to make the following instructions simpler:
      mv filepath-1.1.0.0/ filepath/
      mv Cabal-1.6.0.0/ Cabal/

      cd Cabal
      ghc -i../filepath -cpp --make Setup.hs -o ../filepath/setup
      cd ../filepath/
      ./setup configure --user
      ./setup build
      ./setup install

  This installs `filepath` so that you can install Cabal with the normal
  method.
