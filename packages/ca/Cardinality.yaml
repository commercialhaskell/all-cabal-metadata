  This module introduces typeclasses

  * @HasCard@ = \"Has cardinality\". In other words, \"it's possible to
  measure current count of elements for this container\"

  * @HasCardT@ = \"Has cardinality (for container types of kind
  @(* -> *)@)\". In other words, \"it's possible to measure
  current count of elements for this container (for container types of
  kind @(* -> *)@)\"

  * @HasCardConstr@ = \"Has cardinality constraint\". In other words,
  \"there is a capacity constraint for this container\".

  * @HasCardConstrT@ = \"Has cardinality constraint (for container types
  of kind @(* -> *)@)\".
  In other words, \"there is a capacity constraint for this container type
  of kind @(* -> *)@\".

  * @HasCardUCT@ = \"Has cardinality-unsafe container transform\".
  Define transform that may thow an error, if contents of @from@ don't
  fit in @to@ .

  * @HasCardUCT_T@ = \"Has cardinality-unsafe container
  transform (for container types of kind @(* -> *)@)\".
  Same thing as @HasCardUCT@, but for containers of kind @(* -> *)@.

  No, it's not about playing cards. It's about cardinalities.
  Wikipedia: \"/In mathematics, the cardinality of a set is a measure of
  the number of elements of the set. For example, the set A = {2, 4, 6}
  contains 3 elements, and therefore A has a cardinality of 3./\"
  In this package I dare to extend the definition a bit to
  \"/C. is a measure of the number of elements in a container/\"

  Usual containers are (together with their cardinality ranges):

  * @Identity a@ (1 element)

  * @Maybe a@ (0..1 element)

  * @[a]@ (0..inf elements)

  * @Map k e@ (0..inf elements)

  I extended this to the folowing list:

  * @EmptySet a@ (0 elements)

  * @Identity a@ (1 element)

  * @Maybe a@ (0..1 element)

  * @[a]@ (0..inf elements)

  * @NeverEmptyList a@ (1..inf elements)

  * @Map k e@ (0..inf elements)

  Typeclass @HasCardUCT@ together with function @sContTrans@
  (safe container transform) provides a facility to safely change
  container from one to another keepeng the content. If content doesn't
  fit to target container, @Nothing@ is returned. However, when
  transforming from list @[a]@ to @(Maybe a)@ it won't check list length
  further first 2 elements. The complexity and power of this package is
  that it provides a facility to /lazily/ evaluate amount of content in
  the container.
