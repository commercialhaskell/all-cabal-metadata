  # cabal-file

  cabal-file is a library on top of the hackage-security library for accessing
  cabal files and versions, and also a small tool for getting and comparing
  .cabal files.

  Since it accesses package and .cabal file data directly from
  the local Hackage repo cache index tar archive under ~/.cabal/ it is quite fast.

  ## Usage
  List all Hackage packages:
  ```
  $ cblfile list | grep ghcide
  ghcide
  ```

  List versions of a package:
  ```
  $ cblfile list pandoc
  0.4
  :
  :
  2.9.2.1
  ```

  Diff .cabal files of package versions
  ```
  $ cblfile diff pandoc 2.8 2.9.2.1
  --- pandoc-2.8.cabal    2020-05-24 19:47:58.487921450 +0800
  +++ pandoc-2.9.2.1.cabal        2020-05-24 19:47:58.487921450 +0800
  @@ -1,10 +1,10 @@
   name:            pandoc
  -version:         2.8
  +version:         2.9.2.1
   cabal-version:   2.0
  :
  :
  ```

  Latest version of a package:
  ```
  $ cblfile latest extra
  1.7.1
  ```

  Timestamp for the latest .cabal file (or for a specific version):
  ```
  $ cblfile date dhall
  2020-05-19 02:18:01 UTC
  ```

  Save a .cabal file (latest or specific version)
  ```
  $ cblfile get purescript
  $ ls purescript.cabal
  purescript.cabal
  ```

  Check package source metadata:
  ```
  $ cblfile metadata tls-1.5.4
  Size: 150171
  SHA256 Hash "ce42bfa581a50f62776581da4b86408ebb1a51bc6cb2f95ad0a2ac7caa19a437"
  ```

  ## Depends output
  `cblfile depends` outputs quite verbose package dependency lists.

  ## Library
  For library documentation see the [Hackage.Index](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-file/docs/Hackage-Index.html) documentation.

  For example usage see [`app/Cmds.hs`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-file/src/app/Cmds.hs).

  ## Motivation
  I originally wrote the `depends` command for displaying dependency information
  about packages in a more friendly way.

  Later, since [hdiff](http://hdiff.luite.com/) is out of sync for some packages,
  and I use it particularly for comparing versions of .cabal files,
  I decided to create the `diff` command.
  Realising I could pull .cabal files direct from the cabal index cache,
  the rest of cabal-file flowed on from there.
