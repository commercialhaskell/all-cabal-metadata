  Canadian Income Tax
  ===================

  ### Use ###

  This Haskell package consists of a library and executable to fill out the Canadian T1 tax form. The way to
  use it is as follows:

  1. Download the fillable PDF form from [the canada.ca Web
  site](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package/ontario/5006-r.html).

  2. Fill out the form; don't bother filling out any fields that are calculated from other fields in the same
  form, that part will be performed automatically.

  3. Save the filled-out PDF form.

  4. Run

         pdftk 5006-r-fill-22e.pdf generate_fdf output 5006-r-fill-22e.fdf

  where `5006-r-fill-22e.pdf` is the file you previously saved and `5006-r-fill-22e.pdf` is the name of the
  output file; feel free to change them.

  5. Run

         complete-canadian-t1-form 5006-r-fill-22e.fdf -o 5006-r-fill-22e-filled.fdf

  where `5006-r-fill-22e-filled.fdf` is the output FDF file name with all calculated fields automatically
  filled in.

  6. Run

         pdftk 5006-r-fill-22e.pdf fill_form 5006-r-fill-22e-filled.fdf output 5006-r-fill-22e-filled.pdf

  to transfer the FDF field values from the previous step to the new PDF file, `5006-r-fill-22e-filled.pdf`.

  7. Verify the final PDF file. The executable comes with no warranty and has not been approved by CRA. The
  reponsibility for its correctness is still yours.

  8. Print and sign the tax return, then send it to CRA by mail along with your documents. At some point
  they'll hopefully open a way to digitally file the same information they accept on paper, but their EFILE
  protocol is so far not open to the public.


  ### Installation ###

  As you can see from the above instructions, you'll need to install the free `pdftk` executable to deal with
  PDF <-> FDF conversion. See [their instructions](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/). On
  Ubuntu you can simply run

      sudo apt install pdftk

  To install the `complete-canadian-t1-form` executable, you'll need Haskell development tools. The simplest
  procedure overall is to install [`ghcup`](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/), then use it to install `ghc`
  (version 9.2 or greater) and `cabal`, then to run

      cabal install canadian-income-tax
