  # `call-alloy` [![Haskell CI](https://github.com/marcellussiegburg/call-alloy/workflows/Haskell%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marcellussiegburg/call-alloy/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Haskell+CI%22+branch%3Amaster)

  This is a simple library to call [Alloy](http://alloytools.org) given a specification.
  This package installs a simple Java Library to make an API call to the Alloy Library.
  Alloy is installed (as JAR file) alongside this library as well.

  ## Requirements

  - Java Runtime Environment:
    There is currently no warning if you have not set up any Java Runtime Environment.
    However, you will get runtime errors if it is not available when a call to Alloy happens.
    If you want to force a check, perform the test cases.

  ## Please note

  The Java interface to get Alloy instances as well as the
  [Alloy Jar](https://github.com/AlloyTools/org.alloytools.alloy/releases/download/v5.1.0/org.alloytools.alloy.dist.jar)
  file are installed together with this library using usual cabal means (data directory).

  ## The library in action

  This is a basic description on how to use the library.

  ### A specification example

  Consider this Alloy specification of a simple Graph:

  ```Alloy
  abstract sig Node {
    flow : Node -> lone Int,
    stored : one Int
  } {
    stored >= 0
    all n : Node | some flow[n] implies flow[n] >= 0
    no flow[this]
  }

  fun currentFlow(x, y : one Node) : Int {
    let s = x.stored, f = x.flow[y] | s < f implies s else f
  }

  pred withFlow[x, y : one Node] {
    currentFlow[x, y] > 0
  }

  pred show {}

  run withFlow for 3 Int, 2 Node
  ```

  The graph is consisting of `Node`s, which might have some goods `stored` and may deliver them to other `Node`s (via `flow`).
  `Node`s do not have `flow` to themselves.
  The `currentFlow` is the minimum between the flow from the starting `Node` to the end `Node` and the currently `stored` goods at the starting `Node` (note: intermediate `Node`s are not allowed).
  We call two `Nodes` `x` and `y` `withFlow` if `currentFlow` from `x` to `y` is greater than `0`.
  We restrict our search to `3`-Bit signed `Int` values and `2` `Nodes`.

  ### An instance example

  Calling Alloy using `getInstances` and the above program
  could return the following (abbreviated) instance:

  ``` Haskell
  [(Signature {
      scope = Nothing,
      sigName = "$withFlow_x"
      },
    Entry {
      annotation = Just Skolem,
      relation = fromList [
        ("",Single (fromList [Object {objSig = "Node", identifier = 1}]))
        ]
      }),
   (Signature {
      scope = Nothing,
      sigName = "$withFlow_y"
      },
    Entry {
      annotation = Just Skolem,
      relation = fromList [
        ("",Single (fromList [Object {objSig = "Node", identifier = 0}]))
        ]
      }),
   ...
   (Signature {
      scope = Just "this",
      sigName = "Node"
      },
    Entry {
      annotation = Nothing,
      relation = fromList [
        ("",Single (fromList [
          Object {objSig = "Node", identifier = 0},
          Object {objSig = "Node", identifier = 1}
          ])),
        ("flow",Triple (fromList [
          (Object {objSig = "Node", identifier = 0},Object {objSig = "Node", identifier = 1},NumberObject {number = 0}),
          (Object {objSig = "Node", identifier = 1},Object {objSig = "Node", identifier = 0},NumberObject {number = 3})
          ])),
        ("stored",Double (fromList [
          (Object {objSig = "Node", identifier = 0},NumberObject {number = 0}),
          (Object {objSig = "Node", identifier = 1},NumberObject {number = 1})
          ]))
        ]
      })
   ]
  ```

  ### A retrieval example

  Using this library we may retrieve returned signature values using `lookupSig`,
  then query parameter variables of the queried predicate using `unscoped`,
  and query signature sets and relations using `getSingleAs`, `getDoubleAs`, and `getTripleAs`.

  The following Code might for instance be used for the graph example:

  ``` Haskell
  newtype Node = Node Int deriving (Eq, Show, Ord)

  instanceToNames
    :: AlloyInstance
    -> Either String (Set Node, Set (Node, Int), Set (Node, Node, Int), Set (Node), Set (Node))
  instanceToNames insta = do
    let node :: String -> Int -> Either String Node
        node = object "Node" Node
    n     <- lookupSig (scoped "this" "Node") insta
    nodes <- getSingleAs "" node n
    store <- getDoubleAs "stored" node int n
    flow  <- getTripleAs "flow" node node int n
    x     <- lookupSig (unscoped "$withFlow_x") insta >>= getSingleAs "" node
    y     <- lookupSig (unscoped "$withFlow_y") insta >>= getSingleAs "" node
    return (nodes, store, flow, x, y)
  ```

  Calling `instanceToNames` on the above instance would result in the following expression:

  ``` Haskell
  Right (
    fromList [Node 0,Node 1],
    fromList [(Node 0,0),(Node 1,1)],
    fromList [(Node 0,Node 1,0),(Node 1,Node 0,3)],
    fromList [Node 1],
    fromList [Node 0]
    )
  ```
