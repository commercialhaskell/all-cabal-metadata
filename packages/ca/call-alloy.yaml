  # `call-alloy` [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/marcellussiegburg/call-alloy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/marcellussiegburg/call-alloy)

  This is a simple library to call [Alloy](http://alloytools.org) given a specification.
  This package includes a simple Java Library to make an API call to the Alloy Library.
  Alloy is included (as JAR file) within this library as well.

  ## Requriements

  - Java Runtime Environment:
    There is currently no warning if you have not set up any Java Runtime Environment.
    However, you will get runtime errors if it is not availible when a call to Alloy happens.
    If you want to force a check, perform the test cases.

  ## Please note

  The Java interface to get Alloy instances as well as the Alloy Jar file are backed into this library.

  On every call the application checks the [`XdgDirectory`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/directory/docs/System-Directory.html#t:XdgDirectory) if the libraries exist in a current version.
  If not they are placed there together with a version identifier.
