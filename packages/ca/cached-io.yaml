  # Revision history for cached-io

  ## 1.2.0.0

  Thank you [glasserc](https://github.com/glasserc) for your work on previous versions, and a special thanks to
  [Arguggi](https://github.com/Arguggi) for contributing many of the improvements incorporated into this
  version.

  - [Bellroy](https://github.com/bellroy) is the new maintainer of this package. See https://github.com/glasserc/haskell-cached-io/pull/1.
  - New `cachedIO'` and `cachedIOWith'` support generating an action depending on the most recent cached value and its timestamp, if there was one.
  - `cachedIO ttl f` can now be run in a different monad to `f`. Similarly for `cachedIO'`, `cachedIOWith`, `cachedIOWith'`.
  - Fixes uncaught exceptions leaving the cache in a deadlocked state and other problems.

  # cached-io: cache a single IO action

  Sometimes you have an action that does something really expensive
  whose results don't change that much. This is a simple library that
  lets you cache the output of that expensive action for a
  developer-specified length of time.

  `test/test-cachedIO.hs` shows a very basic usage example.

  ## Developing this library

  All standardised tooling is provided by `flake.nix`.

  ```shell
  nix develop
  ```

  ### Formatting code

  | To format | use                                                                                          |
  | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `*.cabal` | [`cabal-fmt`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-fmt) (`cabal-fmt --inplace *.cabal`) |
  | `*.nix`   | [`nixpkgs-fmt`](https://github.com/nix-community/nixpkgs-fmt) (`nixpkgs-fmt *.nix`)          |

  We have not yet chosen a formatter for Haskell source. For now, try to follow
  the style of surrounding code.
