  \  Sat Apr 6 21:40:45 2019 +0800\n\n    Bugfix: Wrong source file was fed to C2HS.\n
  \   \n    C2HS should be the step after lambda annotation expanding. But it was\n
  \   fed with the input of former step, instead of the output. This was not\n    noted
  until building cairo-core with previous version of Cairo.\n    \n    Another issue
  appeared when building with previous versoin of Cairo,\n    that the dumb version
  of functions triggered two warnings. No type\n    signature and unused variables.
  Also fixed.\n\ncommit ccb4d612c2428a7fd013359363ed07ae897d7201\nAuthor: Magicloud

  \   Fix Render generation logic. Now this package is rebuildable and works\n    with
  haddock.\n    \n    Building system skips source files that are not changed after
  last\n    building. Thus those files won't be scanned by `genRender`. Therefore\n
  \   target Render.hs did not contain methods from those since it was always\n    from
  Render.hs in source.\n    \n    Now target Render.hs is checked first to see if
  this is just updating\n    some Decls, or generating new from source.\n\ncommit

  # Cairo Haskell binding - Core

  This is a library for Haskell to use Cairo function straightforwardly. This package only contains non-optional functions (which is not controlled by building flags). Optional functions like surface supporting and font supporting are in "cairo-opts".

  The source is inspired by [garetxe](https://github.com/garetxe) and [cohomology](https://github.com/cohomology).

  ## Memory safe

  All the pointers should be reference/destroy -ed as manual required, if possible. Hopefully I did not miss any part or misunderstand the document.

  ## Type

  When making the library, I tried to use more meaningful type name. So one looking at the type signature would know what to do.

  ## Render

  A sugar monad wrapping all functions use `Context` as first parameter, like cairo from gtk2hs does.

  ## Status check

  Checking the status of most Cairo objects is necessary, after creation, or a sequence of actions on it. A sugar method `with` is given for `Render`. And a method `use` is given for regular IO monad.
