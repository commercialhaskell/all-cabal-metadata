description: ! "# cacophony\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/centromere/cacophony.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/centromere/cacophony)\n[![Haskell](http://b.repl.ca/v1/language-haskell-blue.png)](http://www.haskell.org)\n\nThis
  library implements the [Noise](https://github.com/noiseprotocol/noise_spec/blob/master/noise.md)
  protocol.\n\n## Basic usage\n\n1. Import the modules for the kind of handshake you'd
  like to use.\n\n   For example, if you want to use `Noise_IK_25519_AESGCM_SHA256`,
  your imports would be:\n   ```haskell\n   import Control.Lens\n\n   import Crypto.Noise\n
  \  import Crypto.Noise.Cipher.AESGCM\n   import Crypto.Noise.DH\n   import Crypto.Noise.DH.Curve25519\n
  \  import Crypto.Noise.Hash.SHA256\n   import Crypto.Noise.HandshakePatterns (noiseIK)\n
  \  ```\n\n2. Set the handshake parameters.\n\n   Select a handshake pattern to use.
  Patterns are defined in the `Crypto.Noise.HandshakePatterns` module.\n   Ensure
  that you provide the keys which are required by the handshake pattern you choose.
  For example,\n   the `Noise_IK` pattern requires that the initiator provides a local
  static key and a remote static key,\n   while the responder is only responsible
  for a local static key. You can use `defaultHandshakeOpts` to\n   return a default
  set of options in which the prologue is an empty string, PSKs are disabled, and
  all\n   keys are set to `Nothing`. You must set the local ephemeral key for all
  handshake patterns, and it\n   should never be reused.\n\n   Functions for manipulating
  DH keys can be found in the `Crypto.Noise.DH` module.\n\n   ```haskell\n   -- Initiator\n
  \  local_ephemeral_key <- dhGenKey :: IO (KeyPair Curve25519)\n\n   let dho = defaultHandshakeOpts
  noiseIK InitiatorRole :: HandshakeOpts Curve25519\n        iho = dho & hoPrologue
  \      .~ \"prologue\"\n                  & hoPreSharedKey   .~ Just pre_shared_key\n
  \                 & hoLocalStatic    .~ Just local_static_key\n                  &
  hoLocalEphemeral .~ Just local_ephemeral_key\n                  & hoRemoteStatic
  \  .~ Just remote_static_key -- communicated out-of-band\n\n   -- Responder\n   local_ephemeral_key
  <- dhGenKey :: IO (KeyPair Curve25519)\n\n   let dho = defaultHandshakeOpts noiseIK
  ResponderRole :: HandshakeOpts Curve25519\n        rho = dho & hoPrologue       .~
  \"prologue\"\n                  & hoPreSharedKey   .~ Just pre_shared_key\n                  &
  hoLocalStatic    .~ Just local_static_key\n                  & hoLocalEphemeral
  .~ Just local_ephemeral_key\n   ```\n\n3. Create the Noise state.\n   ```haskell\n
  \  -- Initiator\n   let ins = noiseState iho :: NoiseState AESGCM Curve25519 SHA256\n\n
  \  -- Responder\n   let rns = noiseState rho :: NoiseState AESGCM Curve25519 SHA256\n
  \  ```\n\n4. Send and receive messages.\n   ```haskell\n   -- Initiator\n   let
  writeResult        = writeMessage ins \"They must find it difficult -- those who
  have taken authority as the truth, rather than truth as the authority.\"\n        (ciphertext,
  ins') = either (error \"something terrible happened\") id writeResult\n\n   -- Responder\n
  \  let readResult        = readMessage rns ciphertext\n        (plaintext, rns')
  = either (error \"something terrible happened\") id readResult\n   ```\n\n   **Ensure
  that you never re-use a noise state to send more than one message.**\n\n   Decrypted
  messages are stored internally as `ScrubbedBytes` and will be wiped from memory
  when they are\n   destroyed.\n\n### Helper functions\n\nThe following functions
  are found in `Crypto.Noise` and can be helpful when designing an application which
  uses\nNoise:\n\n  * `remoteStaticKey` -- For handshake patterns where the remote
  party's static key is transmitted, this function\n    can be used to retrieve it.
  This allows for the creation of public key-based access-control lists.\n\n  * `handshakeComplete`
  -- Returns `True` if the handshake is complete.\n\n  * `handshakeHash` -- Retrieves
  the `h` value associated with the conversation's SymmetricState. This value is\n
  \   intended to be used for channel binding. For example, the initiator might cryptographically
  sign this value\n    as part of some higher-level authentication scheme. See section
  9.4 of the protocol for details.\n\n## Vectors\n\nTest vectors can be generated
  and verified using the `vectors` program. It accepts no arguments. When run,\nit
  will check for the existence of `vectors/cacophony.txt` within the current working
  directory. If it is not\nfound, it is generated. If it is found, it is verified.
  All files within the `vectors/` directory (regardless\nof their name) are also verified.\n\nThe
  generated vectors are minified JSON. There is a small python script within the `tools/`
  directory that\nformats the JSON-blob in to something more readable.\n\n## Example
  code\n\nAn echo-server and echo-client are located within the `examples/` directory.
  The binary protocol they use to\ncommunicate is as follows:\n```\nC -> S: [psk byte]
  [pattern byte] [cipher byte] [dh byte] [hash byte]\nC -> S: [num message bytes (uint16
  big endian)] [message]\nS -> C: [num message bytes (uint16 big endian)] [message]\n...\n```\n\nwhere
  `message` is any raw Noise handshake or message data.\n\nThe prologue is set to
  the 5 header bytes to prevent a MITM attack.\n\nFor these example programs, the
  server chooses the value of the PSK, and the client chooses whether or not\nto use
  a PSK-enabled handshake. Both the server and client expect the PSK file to be base64
  encoded. One\nway to generate the PSK file is as follows:\n```\nhead -c 32 /dev/random
  | base64 > psk\n```\n\nTo include these examples in your build, pass the `-fbuild-examples`
  flag to Cabal.\n\n### Byte definitions\n\n| byte | psk      | pattern | cipher     |
