  # Gild

  Gild is an opinionated command line utility that formats Haskell package
  descriptions, which are also known as `*.cabal` files. Gild can also be used to
  automatically discover `exposed-modules`; see [the pragmas section][] for more
  about that.

  [the pragmas section]: #pragmas

  Gild started as a fork of [phadej/cabal-fmt][], but is now totally separate.
  For a brief summary of the differences between Gild and `cabal-fmt`, read [the
  announcement post][].

  ## Summary

  Given a package description like this:

  ``` cabal
  CABAL-VERSION : 3.0
  name          : example
  version       : 0.0.0.0

  library
    build-depends: mtl>=2.3, base
    ghc-options:-Wall
    if impl(ghc>=9.8)
      ghc-options: -Wmissing-role-annotations
  ```

  Gild will produce output like this:

  ``` cabal
  cabal-version: 3.0
  name: example
  version: 0.0.0.0

  library
    build-depends:
      base,
      mtl >=2.3,

    ghc-options: -Wall

    if impl(ghc >= 9.8)
      ghc-options: -Wmissing-role-annotations
  ```

  See [the installation section][] for how to get Gild and [the usage section][]
  for how to use it.

  [the installation section]: #installation
  [the usage section]: #usage

  ## Goals

  - There should be no configuration options. As long as the output format is
    reasonable, the specifics should not matter too much. This means the amount
    of indentation cannot be changed, for example.

  - The output should be diff friendly. This means things generally go on their
    own line, trailing commas are used when possible, and elements are sorted
    where it makes sense.

  - The output should be semantically the same as the input. This means no
    normalization or canonicalization. For example, separate `build-depends`
    fields are not merged together.

  - It should be possible to format other files that use the same format as
    package descriptions. This means `cabal.project` files can be formatted as
    well.

  - The focus should be mostly on formatting. There should be no effort made to
    validate input or provide any checks or lints. However some quality of life
    features, like automatic module discovery, are desireable.

  - Formatting should be as regular as possible. Special cases for particular
    fields or sections should be avoided unless it improves quality of life. For
    example, interpreting the `build-depends` field to pretty print it is okay.

  - The command line utility should be fast enough to run on every save. It
    should not need network access.

  ## Installation

  Go to [the latest release page][] and download the binary for your platform.

  [the latest release page]: https://github.com/tfausak/cabal-gild/releases/latest

  To run Gild in a GitHub Actions workflow, consider using [cabal-gild-setup-action][].

  ### From Source

  In general you should prefer downloading the appropriate binary for you
  platform. However it is possible to build Gild from source. It supports Linux,
  macOS, and Windows along with the four most recent versions of GHC. Any other
  configurations are unsupported.

  With Cabal:

  ``` sh
  $ cabal install cabal-gild
  ```

  With Stack:

  ``` sh
  $ stack install cabal-gild
  ```

  ## Usage

  Gild is a command line utility named `cabal-gild`. By default it reads from
  standard input (STDIN) and writes to standard output (STDOUT). Its behavior can
  be modified with command line options, which are described below.

  ### Options

  Run `cabal-gild --help` to see the options that Gild supports. They are:

  - `--help`: Prints the help message to STDOUT then exits successfully.

  - `--version`: Prints the version number to STDOUT then exits successfully.

  - `--crlf=LENIENCY`: Sets the CRLF handling mode, which must be either
    `lenient` (the default) or `strict`. When checking if the input is formatted,
    setting this to `lenient` will treat CRLF line endings the same as LF.
    Setting this to `strict` will require the input to be byte-for-byte identical
    to the expected output. (Note that Gild will never produce CRLF line endings
    when formatting.)

    It is an error to provide a value for this option unless the mode is `check`.

  - `--input=FILE`: Uses `FILE` as the input. If this is `-` (which is the
    default), then the input will be read from STDIN.

  - `--io=FILE`: Shortcut for setting both `--input=FILE` and `--output=FILE` at
    the same time. This is useful for formatting a file in-place.

  - `--mode=MODE`: Sets the mode to `MODE`, which must be either `format` (the
    default) or `check`. When the mode is `format`, Gild will output the
    formatted package description. When the mode is `check`, Gild will exit
    successfully if the input is already formatted, otherwise it will exit
    unsuccessfully.

  - `--output=FILE`: Uses `FILE` as the output. If this is `-` (which is the
    default), then the output will be written to STDOUT. To modify a file in
    place, use the same file as both input and output. For example:

    ``` sh
    $ cabal-gild --input p.cabal --output p.cabal
    ```

    It is an error to provide a value for this option when the mode is `check`.

  - `--stdin=FILE`: When reading input from STDIN, use `FILE` as the effective
    input file. This is useful when a file's contents are already available, like
    in an editor. For example:

    ``` sh
    $ cabal-gild --stdin p.cabal < p.cabal
    ```

    It is an error to provide a value for this option unless the input is `-`.

  ### Pragmas

  Gild supports special comments in package descriptions that act as pragmas.
  Each pragma starts with `-- cabal-gild:`. Pragmas must be the last comment
  before a field.

  - `-- cabal-gild: discover DIRECTORY [DIRECTORY ...]`: This pragma will
    discover any Haskell files in any of the given directories and use those to
    populate the list of modules or signatures. For example, given this input:

    ``` cabal
    library
      -- cabal-gild: discover source/library
      exposed-modules: ...
    ```

    Assuming there is a single Haskell file at `source/library/M.hs`, Gild will
    produce this output:

    ``` cabal
    library
      -- cabal-gild: discover source/library
      exposed-modules: M
    ```

    This pragma only works with the `exposed-modules`, `other-modules`, and
    `signatures` fields. It will be ignored on all other fields.

    Any existing modules or signatures in the list will be ignored. The entire
    field will be replaced. This means adding, removing, and renaming modules or
    signatures should be handled automatically.

    This pragma searches for files with any of the following extensions: `*.chs`,
    `*.cpphs`, `*.gc`, `*.hs`, `*.hsc`, `*.hsig`, `*.lhs`, `*.lhsig`, `*.ly`,
    `*.x`, or `*.y`,
