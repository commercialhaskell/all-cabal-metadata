  : Remove superseded artefacts of `cabal v2-build`\n=============================================================\n\nRemoves
  compilation artefacts in `dist-newstyle/build` from older\nversions of the package
  or superseded minor versions of GHC.\n\nFor the impatient\n-----------------\n\n###
  Installation\n\n    cabal install cabal-clean\n\n### Run\n\n    cd $MY_PROJECT\n
  \   cabal-clean\n\nThis lists the build artifacts under `dist-newstyle/build`.\n```diff\n---\t191M\tdist-newstyle/build/x86_64-osx/ghc-7.10.3/$MY_PROJECT-2.9.2\n---\t

  superseded ones (assuming `ghc-9.0.1` is not on the `PATH`),\nprinted in red and
  prefixed by dashes (`---`),\ncan then be removed by:\n\n    cabal-clean --delete\n\nRationale\n---------\n\n`v2-cabal`
  (the nix-based `cabal`) maintains a directory structure for\nlocal builds of the
  form\n`dist-newstyle/build/$ARCH/$HC/$PACKAGE-$VERSION` (plus other stuff\nthat
  does not take up much disk space).  During active development\nwith several `$HC`
  versions and `$VERSION` bumps for the `$PACKAGE`,\nlots of out-dated build artefacts
  accumulate over time.\n\nA simple way to clean up is removing the whole `dist-newstyle`
  folder,\nbut one might want to keep the build artefacts of the most recent\npackage
  `$VERSION`s of the most recent versions of the Haskell\ncompiler (`$HC`).\n\nPhilosophy\n----------\n\n-
  Go for saving the most disk space with the simplest approach, rather\n  than a complete
  clean-up.  E.g., don't care about outdated contents\n  in `dist-newstyle/package-db`
  as they take little space.\n\n- Keep only the most recent `$VERSION` of the package.\n\n-
  Keep only the most recent major versions of `$HC`.\n\n- Keep only versions build
  with a `$HC` which is still on the PATH\n  (since version 0.2).\n\n- Assume a monopoly
  of GHC, ignoring other Haskell compilers, so only\n  treat `$HC`s of the form `ghc-$GHCVER`.\n\n-
  Work autonomously, ignoring `cabal` files.\n  This saves us parsing various home-grown
  `cabal` file formats.\n  The latter could be easy using the `Cabal` package,\n  but
  this package is not very stable,\n  and we shy the maintenance effort of depending
  on `Cabal`.\n\n- Dry-run is the default, giving the user opportunity to review the
  clean-up plan.\n\nFunctionality\n-------------\n\n- Read the contents of `dist-newstyle/build`,\n
  \ organizing them into a tree according to the pattern\n  `$ARCH/ghc-$GHCVER/$PACKAGE-$VERSION`.\n\n-
  Display the outdated versions.\n\n  Try to get the disk usage with `du -h` and display
  it.\n  (I could not find a Haskell library that gets the disk usage OS-agnostically.)\n\n-
  With option `--delete` actually remove the respective folders.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nList
  build artifacts of current project,\nmarking superseded ones that can be deleted:\n\n
  \   cabal-clean\n\nActually delete superseded builds:\n\n    cabal-clean --delete\n\nDelete
  superseded builds without changing to directory:\n\n    cabal-clean --delete path/to/my/project/dist-newstyle\n\nDelete
  superseded builds in many projects:\n\n    find . -name \"dist-newstyle\" -exec
  cabal-clean --delete {} \\;\n\nGet help:\n\n    cabal-clean --help\n\nRelated\n-------\n\n`cabal
  v2-clean` (as of 2021-08-16)\n\n  - Removes *all* build artefacts.\n  - Does not
  have a `--dry-run` preview.\n"
