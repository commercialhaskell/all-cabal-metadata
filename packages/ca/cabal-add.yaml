  # cabal-add [![Hackage](http://img.shields.io/hackage/v/cabal-add.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-add) [![Stackage LTS](http://stackage.org/package/cabal-add/badge/lts)](http://stackage.org/lts/package/cabal-add) [![Stackage Nightly](http://stackage.org/package/cabal-add/badge/nightly)](http://stackage.org/nightly/package/cabal-add)

  Extend Cabal `build-depends` from the command line.

  `cabal-add` does not have limitations of
  [`cabal-edit`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-edit):
  it works on any sectioned Cabal file,
  supports stanzas and conditional blocks,
  and preserves original formatting.

  Install the executable with

  ```
  cabal install cabal-add
  ```

  To add a dependency on `foo`, switch to a folder with your project and execute

  ```
  cabal-add foo
  ```

  If you are using Cabal 3.12+ which supports
  [external commands](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/3.12/external-commands.html),
  you can omit the dash:

  ```
  cabal add foo
  ```

  Command-line arguments:

  * `--project-file FILE`

    Set the path of the cabal.project file. Detect `cabal.project` or `*.cabal`
    in the current folder, if omitted.

  * `ARGS`

    Optional [target](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cabal-commands.html#target-forms)
    (wildcards such as `exe`, `test` or `bench` are supported) to update, followed
    by a non-empty list of package(s) to add to
    `build-depends` section. Version bounds can be
    provided as well, use quotes to escape comparisons
    from your shell. E. g., `'foo < 0.2'`.
