description: |-
  Have you ever needed to get information from a cabal file in a shell
  script? Now you can! cabal-info exposes a simple command-line
  interface to the cabal file format.

  There is also a library interface, to solve tasks based on searching
  for a .cabal file and then doing something with it.

  See the <https://github.com/barrucadu/cabal-info README> for more
  details.
