  # Revision history for capability

  ## 0.5.0.0 -- 2021-07-21

  * Fix compatibility with GHC 9.0.
    See [#96](https://github.com/tweag/capability/pull/96)

  * Remove `Capability.Writer.Discouraged`.
    This module incurred a dependency on monad-unlift which is no longer
    available for GHC 9.0. Given that its use was discouraged, it was deemed best
    to remove it.
    See [#96](https://github.com/tweag/capability/pull/96)

  * Added `censor` function to `Capability.Writer`.
    See [#94](https://github.com/tweag/capability/pull/94)

  ## 0.4.0.0 -- 2021-03-15

  * Fix infinite loop in `writer`.
    See [#85](https://github.com/tweag/capability/pull/85)

  * Introduce `Capability.Reflection` to define ad-hoc interpreters.
    See [#86](https://github.com/tweag/capability/pull/86)

  * Fix compatibility with GHC 8.10.
    See [#87](https://github.com/tweag/capability/pull/87)

  ## 0.3.0.0 -- 2020-03-19

  * Rename HasStream to HasSink, for symmetry.
    See [#75](https://github.com/tweag/capability/pull/75)

  * Introduce HasSource, a superclass of HasReader.
    See [#75](https://github.com/tweag/capability/pull/75)

  * Make HasSource and HasSink superclasses of HasState.
    See [#75](https://github.com/tweag/capability/pull/75)

  * Introduce `derive` to run an action that requires additional capabilities.
    See [#74](https://github.com/tweag/capability/pull/74)
    and [#83](https://github.com/tweag/capability/pull/83)

  * Handlers `zoom` and `magnify` can now carry capabilities over from the context.
    See [#73](https://github.com/tweag/capability/pull/73)

  * Introduce functional capabilities and the `TypeOf` type family.
    See [#72](https://github.com/tweag/capability/pull/72)

  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2019-03-22

  * Make HasStream a superclass of HasWriter.
    See [#64](https://github.com/tweag/capability/pull/64)
  * Bumped version bounds on generic-lens.
    See [#67](https://github.com/tweag/capability/pull/67)

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2018-10-04

  * Initial release.

  # capability: effects, extensionally

  [![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/a44574059e13fc443caa437226af5ae5e67b6a5ae012534712.svg?branch=master)](https://buildkite.com/tweag-1/capability)

  A capability is a type class that says explicitly which effects
  a function is allowed to use. The [`mtl`][mtl] works like this too.
  But unlike the `mtl`, this library decouples effects from their
  implementation. What this means in practice:

  - You can implement large sets of capabilities using the
    efficient [`ReaderT` pattern][readert], rather than a slow monad
    transformer stack.
  - Capabilities compose well: e.g. it's easy to have multiple reader
    effects.
  - You can use a writer effect without implementing it as a writer
    monad (which is known to [leak space][writer-space-leak]).
  - You can reason about effects. For instance, if a monad provides a
   reader effect at type `IORef A`, it also provides a state effect at type `A`

  For more on these, you may want to read the announcement [blog
   post][blog].

  This library is an alternative to the [`mtl`][mtl]. It defines a set
  of standard, reusable capability type classes, such as the `HasReader`
  and `HasState` type classes, which provide the standard reader and
  state effects, respectively.

  Where `mtl` instances only need to be defined once and for all,
  capability-style programming has traditionally suffered from verbose
  boilerplate: rote instance definitions for every new implementation of
  the capability. Fortunately GHC 8.6 introduced
  the [`DerivingVia`][deriving-via] language extension. We use it to
  remove the boilerplate, turning capability-style programming into an
  appealing alternative to `mtl`-style programming. The
  [`generic-lens`][generic-lens] library is used to access fields of
  structure in the style of the [`ReaderT` pattern][readert].

  An additional benefit of separating capabilities from their
  implementation is that they avoid a pitfall of the `mtl`. In the
  `mtl`, two different `MonadState` are disambiguated by their types,
  which means that it is difficult to have two `MonadState Int` in the
  same monad stack. Capability type classes are parameterized by a name
  (also known as a *tag*). This makes it possible to combine multiple
  versions of the same capability. For example,

  ```haskell
  twoStates :: (HasState "a" Int m, HasState "b" Int m) => m ()
  ```

  Here, the tags `"a"` and `"b"` refer to different state spaces.

  In summary, compared to the `mtl`:

  - capabilities represent what effects a function can use, rather than
    how the monad is constructed;
  - capabilities are named, rather than disambiguated by type;
  - capabilites are discharged with deriving-via combinators
    and [`generic-lens`][generic-lens], rather than with instance
    resolution.

  An example usage looks like this:

  ``` haskell
  testParity :: (HasReader "foo" Int m, HasState "bar" Bool m) => m ()
  testParity = do
    num <- ask @"foo"
    put @"bar" (even num)

  data Ctx = Ctx { foo :: Int, bar :: IORef Bool }
    deriving Generic

  newtype M a = M { runM :: Ctx -> IO a }
    deriving (Functor, Applicative, Monad) via ReaderT Ctx IO
    -- Use DerivingVia to derive a HasReader instance.
    deriving (HasReader "foo" Int, HasSource "foo" Int) via
      -- Pick the field foo from the Ctx record in the ReaderT environment.
      Field "foo" "ctx" (MonadReader (ReaderT Ctx IO))
    -- Use DerivingVia to derive a HasState instance.
    deriving (HasState "bar" Bool, HasSource "bar" Bool, HasSink "bar" Bool) via
      -- Convert a reader of IORef to a state capability.
      ReaderIORef (Field "bar" "ctx" (MonadReader (ReaderT Ctx IO)))

  example :: IO ()
  example = do
      rEven <- newIORef False
      runM testParity (Ctx 2 rEven)
      readIORef rEven >>= print
      runM testParity (Ctx 3 rEven)
      readIORef rEven >>= print
  ```

  ## Examples

  An example is provided in [`WordCount`](examples/WordCount.hs).
  Execute the following commands to try it out:

  ```
  $ nix-shell --pure --run "cabal configure --enable-tests"
  $ nix-shell --pure --run "cabal repl examples"

  ghci> :set -XOverloadedStrings
  ghci> wordAndLetterCount "ab ba"
  Letters
  'a': 2
  'b': 2
  Words
  "ab": 1
  "ba": 1
  ```

  To execute all examples and see if they produce the expected results run

  ```
  $ nix-shell --pure --run "cabal test examples --show-details=streaming --test-option=--color"
  ```

  ## Build instructions

  ### Nix Shell

  A development environment with all dependencies in scope is defined in
  [`shell.nix`](shell.nix).

  ### Build

  The build instructions assume that you have [Nix][nix] installed.
  Execute the following command to build the library.

  ```
  $ nix-shell --pure --run "cabal configure"
  $ nix-shell --pure --run "cabal build"
  ```
