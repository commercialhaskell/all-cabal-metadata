changelog: "0.1.1.0:  \n    Canon.hs: Substantial enhancements to support hyperexpressions
  as first-class numbers.  Most of the changes were to this file.\n\n0.1.0.4:\n    AurifCyclo.hs:
  Remove fromCycloMap, cmLookup from API and remove fromCycloMap function.\n                   Add
  exposed function getIntegerCycloMap.\n                   Correct comment for crCycloInitMap
  \                \n    Canon.hs: API change: Update set of functions exposed from
  AurifCyclo (in accordance with the above).\n\n0.1.0.3:\n    The Internals.hs and
  Additive.hs modules are no longer exposed.\n\n    Various enhancements to documentation.\n\n
  \   Additions to Math.NumberTheory/Canon.hs API   ( (*) means it had previously
  existed in some form. )\n    -------------------------------------------\n        Canon(*),
  CanonElement, BareStatus(*), CanonValueType(*):  Types exposed to different degrees\n
  \       CycloMap, fromCycloMap, cmLookup, showCyclo, crCycloInitMap: Exposes cyclotomic
  map-related functionality from AurifCyclo.\n\n        New divisor-related functions:\n
  \       cNumDivisors / cTau, cDivisors, cNthDivisor, cWhichDivisor\n\n        New
  \"reflection\" functions:\n        getBase, getExponent, getBases, getExponents,
  getElements\n  \n    Removals from Math.NumberTheory.Canon API\n    -----------------------------------------\n
  \       makeC: Removed from code as well \n        (%):  Removed from code as well.
  \ Mod operator was redundant.\n        canonToGCR, cToGCR: Internal functions that
  should not been exposed.  canonToGCR was removed from the code itself\n\n    Bug
  fix:\n    --------\n        cHyperOp : This did not work for the general case.  In
  the next larger release, this function will be enhanced\n        and appropriate
  tests will be added.\n\n0.1.0.2:\n    Bug fix for pattern PN1 in Internals.hs\n\n0.1.0.1:\n
