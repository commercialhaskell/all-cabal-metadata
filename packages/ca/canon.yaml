synopsis: Arithmetic for Psychedelically Large Numbers
changelog: "0.1.1.2:\n    Change to use aritmoi-0.9.0.0. Breaking change with primes
  function.\n\n0.1.1.1: \n    Add support for arithmoi-0.9.0.0 which had a breaking
  change that affected the Internals.hs file. (No change to API)\n\n0.1.1.0:  \n    Canon.hs:
  Substantial enhancements to support hyperexpressions as first-class numbers.  Most
  of the changes were to this file.\n    Allow for partially factored numbers so the
  code will not hang endlessly on numbers with large composite factors.\n\n0.1.0.4:\n
  \   AurifCyclo.hs: Remove fromCycloMap, cmLookup from API and remove fromCycloMap
  function.\n                   Add exposed function getIntegerCycloMap.\n                   Correct
  comment for crCycloInitMap                 \n    Canon.hs: API change: Update set
  of functions exposed from AurifCyclo (in accordance with the above).\n\n0.1.0.3:\n
  \   The Internals.hs and Additive.hs modules are no longer exposed.\n\n    Various
  enhancements to documentation.\n\n    Additions to Math.NumberTheory/Canon.hs API
  \  ( (*) means it had previously existed in some form. )\n    -------------------------------------------\n
  \       Canon(*), CanonElement, BareStatus(*), CanonValueType(*):  Types exposed
  to different degrees\n        CycloMap, fromCycloMap, cmLookup, showCyclo, crCycloInitMap:
  Exposes cyclotomic map-related functionality from AurifCyclo.\n\n        New divisor-related
  functions:\n        cNumDivisors / cTau, cDivisors, cNthDivisor, cWhichDivisor\n\n
  \       New \"reflection\" functions:\n        getBase, getExponent, getBases, getExponents,
  getElements\n  \n    Removals from Math.NumberTheory.Canon API\n    -----------------------------------------\n
  \       makeC: Removed from code as well \n        (%):  Removed from code as well.
  \ Mod operator was redundant.\n        canonToGCR, cToGCR: Internal functions that
  should not been exposed.  canonToGCR was removed from the code itself\n\n    Bug
  fix:\n    --------\n        cHyperOp : This did not work for the general case.  In
  the next larger release, this function will be enhanced\n        and appropriate
  tests will be added.\n\n0.1.0.2:\n    Bug fix for pattern PN1 in Internals.hs\n\n0.1.0.1:\n
  \   Improvements to documentation.\n    Fix typos and word omissions.\n    Remove
  unused / \"unsafe\" Cr functions from AurifCyclo.hs\n\n0.1.0.0:\n    First release\n"
