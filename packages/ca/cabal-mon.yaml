  This is a utility which monitors changes to the files in a directory.
  It was designed to make it easy to monitor parallel Cabal builds.

  The utility works by monitoring the log files produced by Cabal,
  using `fswatch`, which is available here:

  http://emcrisostomo.github.io/fswatch/

  A typical use would be to simply invoke it in a sandbox:

      cabal-mon

  This will automatically find the directory with the Cabal logs,
  and start up an instance of `fswatch` to monitor the files for modifications.

  The default `fswatch` monitor for Mac OS does not report events very
  frequently, so you may have better luck by using the `kqueue` one:

      cabal-mon -m kqueue_monitor

  When files are updated, their content will be displayed by the utility.
  The menu uses the following colors:

    * green: this is the package that is currently being watched
    * red:   this package has changes that you have not yet looked at
    * white: this package has not changed since the last time you looked at it
