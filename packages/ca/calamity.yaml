changelog: "# Changelog for Calamity\n\n## 0.10.0.0\n\n+ Updated `CreateMessageAttachment.content`
  to be a `Network.HTTP.Client.RequestBody`\n  to allow for easy streaming of uploads\n\n##
  0.9.0.0\n\n+ Require tls >= 1.7\n+ Bump dependencies to support tls-1.7\n\n## 0.7.1.0\n\n+
  Fix ratelimits being effectively broken (succ -> pred)\n\n## 0.7.0.1\n\n+ Fix accidental
  semver breakage\n\n## 0.7.0.0\n\n+ Added the `CDNAsset` typeclass for resolving
  CDN asset links and fetching\n  them.\n+ Added the module `Calamity.Types.Model.Avatar`
  with the types `Avatar` and\n  `MemberAvatar`\n+ Changed the `avatar` field of `User`
  and `Member` to be `Avatar` (the default\n  avatar will be fetched if the user does
  not have one set).\n+ Added the field `banner` to `User` and `Member` with type
  `Maybe UserBanner`.\n+ Added the field `accentColour` to `User` and `Member` with
  type `Maybe (Colour Double)`.\n+ Added the field `locale` to `User` and `Member`
  with type `Maybe Text`.\n+ Added the field `Member.memberAvatar` with type `Text`.
  (discord limitation,\n  the guild id is needed to construct the member's guild avatar
  url, but discord\n  doesn't attach the guild id to the member...)\n+ Added the type
  `RoleIcon` to `Calamity.Types.Model.Guild.Role`.\n+ Added the field `Role.icon`
  with type `RoleIcon`.\n+ Added the field `Role.emoji` with type `RawEmoji`.\n+ Added
  the types `GuildIcon`, `GuildSplash`, `GuildDiscoverySplash`,\n  `GuildBanner` to
  `Calamity.Types.Model.Guild.Guild`.\n+ Changed the type of `Guild.icon` to `Maybe
  GuildIcon`.\n+ Changed the type of `Guild.splash` to `Maybe GuildSplash`.\n+ Added
  the field `Guild.discoverySplash` with type `Maybe\n  GuildDiscoverySplash`.\n+
  Added the field `Guild.banner` with type `Maybe GuildBanner`.\n\n\n## 0.6.0.0\n\n+
  Updated the events `GuildMemberAddEvt`, `GuildMemberRemoveEvt`, and\n  `GuildMemberUpdateEvt`
  to include the relevant `Guild`.\n  \n```hs\nEHType 'GuildMemberAddEvt = (Guild,
  Member)\nEHType 'GuildMemberRemoveEvt = (Guild, Member)\nEHType 'GuildMemberUpdateEvt
  = (Guild, Member, Member)\n```\n\n## 0.5.0.0\n\n+ Replaced lens with optics internally,
  you should use optics for field labels now.\n+ Generic instances have been removed
  from library data types.\n+ Internally, all aeson instances are manually implemented
  now, \n  instead of using generic. Expect a 5x improvement in compile time.\n+ The
  `game` field on `StatusUpdateData` was changed to `activities :: [Activity]`\n\n##
  0.4.0.0\n\n+ DSL functions no longer use a concrete effect list prefix.\n\n## 0.3.0.0\n\n+
  The discord api version has been moved from v9 to v10.\n+ Added support for interactions
  and views with `Calamity.Interactions`.\n+ Some more effects have been put in, `RatelimitEff`
  and `TokenEff`, causing\n  changes to `BotC`, `SetupEff`.\n+ The HTTP client can
  now be used without a `Client` instance.\n+ The `GuildMemberAdd` event now includes
  the guild id of the member.\n+ The `InteractionCreate` event has been added.\n+
  Adding attachments to messages has now been reworked, and `TFile` has been\n  replaced
  with `CreateMessageAttachment`.\n+ The `file` attribute of `CreateMessageOptions`
  has been removed and replaced\n  with `attachments :: Maybe [CreateMessageAttachment]`.\n+
  The `embed` attribute of `CreateMessageOptions` has been replaced with `embeds\n
  \ :: Maybe [Embed]`.\n+ The `components :: Maybe [Component]` field has been added
  to\n  `CreateMessageOptions`.\n+ `editMessageEmbed` has been replaced with `editMessageEmbeds`.\n+
  Added `Calamity.HTTP.Channel.editMessageComponents`.\n+ Added `Calamity.HTTP.Guild.SearchGuildMembers`.\n+
  `Calamity.HTTP.Guild.GetGuildBans` now has a `GetGuildBansOptions` parameter.\n+
  Added the module `Calamity.HTTP.Interaction`.\n+ Added the modules `Calamity.Interactions`,\n
  \ `Calamity.Interactions.{Eff,Utils,View}`.\n+ Fully fleshed out `Calamity.Types.Model.Channel.Component`.\n+
  Removed `stickers` from `Message`.\n+ Removed the `guildID` field from `Member`.\n\n##
  0.2.0.2\n\n+ Dependency bump\n\n## 0.2.0.1\n\n+ Fix a bug causing member objects
  sent alongside messages to not parse correctly.\n\n## 0.2.0.0\n\n+ Remove all usages
  of lazy Text (except from typeclass instances) \n+ Fix a bug that caused http request
  decoding to never select the `()` instance\n  for decoding the response (which meant
  endpoints that had empty responses\n  would always fail to parse).\n+ Bumped the
  minimum version of aeson to 2.0\n\n## 0.1.31.0\n\n+ We now pass through the `.member`
  field of message create/update events to the\n  event handler.\n+ The payload type
  of `MessageCreateEvt` has changed from `Message` to\n  `(Message, Maybe User, Maybe
  Member)`.\n+ The payload type of `MessageUpdateEvt` has changed from `(Message,
  Message)`\n  to `(Message, Message, Maybe User, Maybe Member)`.\n+ The payload type
  of `RawMessageUpdateEvt` has changed from `UpdatedMessage` to\n  `(UpdatedMessage,
  Maybe User, Maybe Member)`.\n+ The provided `ConstructContext` effect handlers have
  changed from handling\n  `ConstructContext Message ...` to `ConstructContext (Message,
  User, Maybe\n  Member) ...`.\n+ `FullContext` now uses the member passed with the
  message create event if\n  available.\n+ `LightContext` now has a `.member` parameter,
  which is the member passed with\n  the message create event if available. The `userID`
  field has also been\n  replaced with `user :: User`.\n+ `CommandNotFound` now contains
  the `User` and `Maybe Member` of the message\n  create event that triggered it.\n\n##
  0.1.30.4\n\n+ The `status` field of `StatusUpdateData` has been changed from `Text`
  to\n  `StatusType`.\n+ Removed the redundant `Typeable` constraint from `BotC` and
  `runBotIO`, etc.\n+ Added the `runBotIO''` function which gives more control over
  the internal\n  state effects.\n\n## 0.1.30.3\n\n+ Added models for interactions
  and components \n  (these are still WIP in this version).\n+ The 'types' help no
  longer shows in command help if the command has\n  no parameters.\n+ Added a HasID
  instance for FullContext and LightContext types.\n\n## 0.1.30.2\n\n+ Removed all
  the orphan instances from the library.\n+ Removed the export of `CalamityCommands.Handler`
  from `Calamity.Commands`.\n+ Added the export of `Calamity.Commands.Types` from
  `Calamity.Commands`.\n+ Fixed some parameter parser instances causing type inference
  to fail\n  ([#48](https://github.com/simmsb/calamity/pull/48)).\n\n## 0.1.30.1\n\n+
  Removed the re-export of `CalamityCommands.ParsePrefix` from Calamity.Commands.\n+
  Added the `Calamity.Commands.Utils.useConstantPrefix` method.\n\n## 0.1.30.0\n\n+
  Removed the `Symbol` parameter of custom events, instead of `'CustomEvt\n  @\"command-error\"
  @(FullContext, CommandError)` it is now `'CustomEvt\n  (CtxCommandError FullContext)`,
  etc.\n+ Added `embedFooter`, `embedImage`, `embedThumbnail`, `embedAuthor`, and\n
  \ `embedField` utility functions.\n+ Added `Default` instances for `EmbedAuthor`.\n+
  Corrected the nullability of `EmbedImage`, `EmbedThumbnail`, `EmbedVideo`, and\n
  \ `EmbedProvider`.\n+ Changed the command parameter machinery to hold more info
  about parameters.\n+ Added a 'type cheatsheet' thing to command help in the default
  help command.\n+ Calamity now uses and re-exports the Calamity-Commands package
  instead of\n  having all the code duplicated.\n+ An extra effect now needs to be
  handled for commands: `ConstructContext`, this\n  also allows you to change which
  context your bot uses.\n+ `Calamity.Commands.Context.Context` has been removed,
  instead use\n  `FullContext`, `LightContext`, or make your own.\n  \n## 0.1.29.0\n\n+

  alt=\"Discord Invite\"></a>\n</p>\n\nCalamity is a Haskell library for writing discord
  bots, it uses\n[Polysemy](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polysemy) as the core
  library for\nhandling effects, allowing you to pick and choose how to handle certain
  features\nof the library.\n\nIf you're looking for something with a less complicated
  interface, you might\nwant to take a look at\n[discord-haskell](https://github.com/aquarial/discord-haskell).\n\nThe
  current customisable effects are:\n\n* Cache: The default cache handler keeps the
  cache in memory, however you could\n  write a cache handler that stores cache in
  a database for example.\n\n* Metrics: The library has counters, gauges, and histograms
  installed to measure\n  useful things, by default these are not used (and cost nothing),
  but could be\n  combined with [Prometheus](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/prometheus).
  An\n  example of using prometheus as the metrics handler can be found\n  [here](https://github.com/simmsb/calamity-example).\n\n*
  Logging: The [di-polysemy](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/di-polysemy)\n  library
  is used to allow the logging effect to be customized, or disabled.\n\n# Docs\n\nYou
  can find documentation on hackage at: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/calamity\n\nThere's
  also a good blog post that covers the fundamentals of writing a bot with\nthe library,
  you can read it here:\nhttps://morrowm.github.io/posts/2021-04-29-calamity.html\n\n#
  Examples\n\nHere's a list of projects that use calamity:\n<!-- - [simmsb/calamity-example](https://github.com/simmsb/calamity-example):
  An extended example of the snippet below, shows use of metrics. -->\n- [simmsb/calamity-bot](https://github.com/simmsb/calamity-bot):
  Uses a database, showing modularization of groups/commands.\n- [MorrowM/pandabot-discord](https://github.com/MorrowM/pandabot-discord):
  Uses a database, performs member role management, etc.\n- [MorrowM/calamity-tutorial](https://github.com/MorrowM/calamity-tutorial):
  A bare minimum bot.\n- [koluacik/gundyr](https://github.com/koluacik/gundyr): An
  admin bot that does role assignment, etc.\n\n(Feel free to contact me via the discord
  server, or email me via\nben@bensimms.moe if you've written a bot using calamity,
  or don't want your\nproject listed here)\n\n``` haskell\n#!/usr/bin/env cabal\n{-

  logging\n\nThe library logs on debug levels by default, if you wish to disable logging
  you\ncan do something along the lines of:\n\n``` haskell\nimport qualified Di\nimport
  qualified Df1\nimport qualified Di.Core\nimport qualified DiPolysemy\n\nfilterDi
  :: Di.Core.Di l Di.Path m -> Di.Core.Di l Di.Path m\nfilterDi = Di.Core.filter (\\_
  p _ -> Df1.Push \"calamity\" `notElem` p)\n\nDi.new $ \\di ->\n-- ...\n  . runDiToIO
  di\n  -- disable logs emitted by calamity\n  . DiPolysemy.local filterDi\n  . runBotIO\n
  \ -- ...\n```\n\n\n## Nix\n\nIf you trust me, I have a [cachix](https://www.cachix.org/)
  cache setup at\n`simmsb-calamity`.\n\nWith cachix installed, you should be able
  to run `cachix use simmsb-calamity` to\nadd my cache to your list of caches.\n\nYou
  can also just manually add the substituter and public key:\n\n```\nsubstituters
  = https://simmsb-calamity.cachix.org\ntrusted-public-keys = simmsb-calamity.cachix.org-1:CQsXXpwKsjSVu0BJFT/JSvy1j6R7rMSW2r3cRQdcuQM=
  \n```\n\nAfter this nix builds should just use the cache (I hope?)\n\nFor an example
  of a bot built using nix, take a look at:\n[simmsb/calamity-bot](https://github.com/simmsb/calamity-bot)\n"
