description: "# `Cabal-hooks`\r\n\r\nThis library provides an API for the `Cabal`
  `Hooks` build type.\r\n\r\n## What is the `Hooks` build type?\r\n\r\nThe `Hooks`
  build type is a new `Cabal` build type that is scheduled to\r\nreplace the `Custom`
  build type, providing better integration with\r\nthe rest of the Haskell ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThe
  original specification for the `Hooks` build type can be found in\r\nthe associated
  [Haskell Foundation Tech Proposal](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/pull/60).\r\n\r\nThese
  *setup hooks* allow package authors to customise the configuration and\r\nbuilding
  of a package by providing certain hooks that get folded into the\r\ngeneral package
  configuration and building logic within `Cabal`.\r\n\r\n## Defining a package with
  custom hooks\r\n\r\nTo use the `Hooks` build type, you will need to\r\n\r\n  * Update
  your `.cabal` file by:\r\n\r\n      - using `cabal-version >= 3.14`,\r\n      -
  declaring `build-type: Hooks`,\r\n      - declaring a `custom-setup` stanza, with
  a `setup-depends`\r\n        field which includes a dependency on `Cabal-hooks`.\r\n
  \ \r\n  * Define a Haskell module `SetupHooks`, which must be placed\r\n    at the
  root of your project and must define a value\r\n    `setupHooks :: SetupHooks`.\r\n\r\nThat
  is, your `.cabal` file should contain the following\r\n\r\n```cabal\r\n-- my-package.cabal\r\ncabal-version:
  3.14\r\nname: my-package\r\nbuild-type: Hooks\r\n\r\ncustom-setup\r\n  setup-depends:\r\n
  \   Cabal-hooks >= 0.1 && < 0.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nand your `SetupHooks.hs` file should
  look like:\r\n\r\n```haskell\r\n-- SetupHooks.hs\r\nmodule SetupHooks ( setupHooks
  ) where\r\n\r\n-- Cabal-hooks\r\nimport Distribution.Simple.SetupHooks\r\n\r\nsetupHooks
  :: SetupHooks\r\nsetupHooks = ...\r\n  -- use the API provided by 'Distribution.Simple.SetupHooks'\r\n
  \ -- to define the hooks relevant to your package\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Using the API\r\n\r\nThe
  [Haddock documentation](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Cabal-hooks)\r\nshould
  help you get started using this library's API.\r\n"
