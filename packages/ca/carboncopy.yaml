description: "Many times you are posting some email to a mailing list. Usually you
  want\nto track replies to your email, as well if someone replies to another email\nin
  the thread, posted by another person.\n\nIf you are using procmail, you may have
  it configured to store mails into\nseparate folders for mailing lists, just to keep
  yourself organized. However,\nyou are forced to check those folders periodically,
  to see if there are new \nreplies to your emails.\n\nProcmail itself doesn't provide
  any functionality to track email threads and\nnotify you if a new email is posted
  to a thread you've started. So this simple\ntool allows to check if email was posted
  in reply to certain one in the thread.\n\nWith simple procmail configuration, like
  below\n\n:0 cW\n* ? /path/to/executable\n/home/user/Maildir/CC/\n\nemails will be
  copied into CC folder, if they are replies to a thread you'd \nstarted.\n\nYou have
  to configure $HOME/.ccrc file as following\n\ncc_header_file = /home/user/.ccheaders\noriginator_email
  = user@domain.com\n\nwhere \n\ncc_header_file - full path to the database of message
  IDs\noriginator_email - email of sender you want to \"Watch\" for replies automatically.\n
  \                  Usually this is your own email address.\n\nHow this works: every
  email should have 2 headers:\n\n- Message-Id - the unique ID of email message, generated
  by MTA\n- In-Reply-To - ID of email, which was replied by current one\n\nSo the
  task of the current tool is to check, if there is a value of In-Reply-To header
  \npresent in the email database (plain text file), and if so - add the current message
  ID\nto the database and exit with code 0.\n\nWe have to add current message ID to
  make it possible follow-ups of the current email\nwill be tracked as well.\n\nIf
  email message contains originator_email from settings file, then current ID of the\nemail
  will be added to the storage as well. So follow-ups will be tracked as well\n"
