  # Changelog

  ## [0.2] - 2025-06-20

  ### Added

  - `sscanf` and `sprintf`.
  - `unitL`, the unique lead for the unit type.
  - `NullL` type synonym for leads and other synonyms for higher arity.
  - Support for lifting isos and prisms from [lens][lens] to leads.
  - Examples to documentation.
  - Flakification.
  - Direnv support.

  ### Changed

  - Types accumulate in the correct order when composing cassettes.
  - `K7` has two type parameters, down from four. The parser and printer
    types are kept in sync.
  - `K7` generalized to arbitrary profunctors.
  - Make `K7` an instance of `Data.Monoid`. `mempty` signifies failure
    and `(<>)` is for alternation, instead of `(<|>)`.
  - Swapped the order of the fields in `K7`.
  - `many1` is now called `some` to be consistent with
    `Control.Applicative`.
  - Change parameter order in `UnL`, `BinL` to match the order in
    [lens][lens].
  - Switched to Apache-2.0 license.

  ### Fixed

  - `choice` works when applied to the empty list.
  - `nilL`, `nothingL` now correctly fail when the input is not the
    expected constructor.
  - Argument to failure continuation in `consL`.

  ### Removed

  - Chaining combinators `catanal`, `catanar` and `chainl`, `chainr`.
