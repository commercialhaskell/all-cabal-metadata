changelog: ! "# 2.4.0.0 [Mikhail Glushenkov](mailto:mikhail.glushenkov@gmail.com)
  September 2018\n  * Due to [#5119](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/5119),
  the\n    `cabal check` warning for bounds on internal libraries has been\n    disabled.\n
  \ * `Distribution.Simple.Haddock` now checks to ensure that it\n    does not erroneously
  call Haddock with no target modules.\n    ([#5232](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/5232),\n
  \   [#5459](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/5459)).\n  * Add `getting` (less
  general than `to`) Lens combinator,\n    `non`) and an optics to access the modules
  in a component\n    of a `PackageDescription` by the `ComponentName`:\n    `componentBuildInfo`
  and `componentModules`\n  * Add `readGhcEnvironmentFile` to parse GHC environment
  files.\n  * Drop support for GHC 7.4, since it is out of our support window\n    (and
  has been for over a year!)\n  * Deprecate `preSDist`, `sDistHook`, and `postSDist`
  in service of\n    `new-sdist`, since they violate key invariants of the new-build\n
  \   ecosystem. Use `autogen-modules` and `build-tool-depends` instead.\n    ([#5389](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/5389)).\n
  \ * Added `--repl-options` flag to `Setup repl` used to pass flags to the\n    underlying
  repl without affecting the `LocalBuildInfo`\n    ([#4247](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/4247),\n
  \   [#5287](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/5287))\n  * `KnownExtension`:
  added new extensions `BlockArguments`\n    ([#5101](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/5101)),\n
  \   `NumericUnderscores`\n    ([#5130]((https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/5130)),\n
  \   `QuantifiedConstraints`, and `StarIsType`.\n  * `buildDepends` is removed from
  `PackageDescription`. It had long been\n    uselessly hanging about as top-level
  build-depends already got put\n    into per-component condition trees anyway. Now
  it's finally been put\n    out of its misery\n    ([#4383](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/4283)).\n
  \ * Added `Eta` to `CompilerFlavor` and to known compilers.\n  * `cabal haddock`
  now generates per-component documentation\n    ([#5226](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/5226)).\n
  \ * Wildcard improvements:\n    * Allow `**` wildcards in `data-files`, `extra-source-files`
  and\n      `extra-doc-files`. These allow a limited form of recursive\n      matching,
  and require `cabal-version: 2.4`.\n      ([#5284](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/5284),\n
  \     [#3178](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/3178), et al.)\n    * With
  `cabal-version: 2.4`, when matching a wildcard, the\n      requirement for the full
  extension to match exactly has been\n      loosened. Instead, if the wildcard's
  extension is a suffix of the\n      file's extension, the file will be selected.
  For example,\n      previously `foo.en.html` would not match `*.html`, and\n      `foo.solaris.tar.gz`
  would not match `*.tar.gz`, but now both\n      do. This may lead to files unexpectedly
  being included by `sdist`;\n      please audit your package descriptions if you
  rely on this\n      behaviour to keep sensitive data out of distributed packages\n
  \     ([#5372](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/5372),\n      [#784](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/784),\n
  \     [#5057](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/5057)).\n    * Wildcard syntax
  errors (misplaced `*`, etc), wildcards that\n      refer to missing directoies,
  and wildcards that do not match\n      anything are now all detected by `cabal check`.\n
  \   * Wildcard ('globbing') functions have been moved from\n      `Distribution.Simple.Utils`
  to `Distribution.Simple.Glob` and\n      have been refactored.\n  * Fixed `cxx-options`
  and `cxx-sources` buildinfo fields for\n    separate compilation of C++ source files
  to correctly build and link\n    non-library components ([#5309](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/5309)).\n
  \ * Reduced warnings generated by hsc2hs and c2hs when `cxx-options` field\n    is
  present in a component.\n  * `cabal check` now warns if `-j` is used in `ghc-options`
  in a Cabal\n    file. ([#5277](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/5277))\n
  \ * `install-includes` now works as expected with foreign libraries\n    ([#5302](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/5299)).\n
  \ * Removed support for JHC.\n  * Options listed in `ghc-options`, `cc-options`,
  `ld-options`,\n    `cxx-options`, `cpp-options` are not deduplicated anymore\n    ([#4449](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/4449)).\n
  \ * Deprecated `cabal hscolour` in favour of `cabal haddock --hyperlink-source`
  ([#5236](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/5236/)).\n  * Recognize `powerpc64le`
  as architecture PPC64.\n  * Cabal now deduplicates more `-I` and `-L` and flags
  to avoid `E2BIG`\n    ([#5356](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/5356)).\n
  \ * With `build-type: configure`, avoid using backslashes to delimit\n    path components
  on Windows and warn about other unsafe characters\n    in the path to the source
  directory on all platforms\n    ([#5386](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/5386)).\n
  \ * `Distribution.PackageDescription.Check.checkPackageFiles` now\n    accepts a
  `Verbosity` argument.\n  * Added a parameter to\n    `Distribution.Backpack.ConfiguredComponent.toConfiguredComponent`
  in order to fix\n    [#5409](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/5409).\n  *
  Partially silence `abi-depends` warnings\n    ([#5465](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/5465)).\n
  \ * Foreign libraries are now linked against the threaded RTS when the\n    'ghc-options:
  -threaded' flag is used\n    ([#5431](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/5431)).\n
  \ * Pass command line arguments to `hsc2hs` using response files when possible\n
  \   ([#3122](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/3122)).\n\n----\n\n## 2.2.0.1
  [Mikhail Glushenkov](mailto:mikhail.glushenkov@gmail.com) March 2018\n\n  * Fix
  `checkPackageFiles` for relative directories ([#5206](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/5206))\n\n\n#
  2.2.0.0 [Mikhail Glushenkov](mailto:mikhail.glushenkov@gmail.com) March 2018\n\n
  \ * The 2.2 migration guide gives advice on adapting Custom setup\n    scripts to
  backwards-incompatible changes in this release:\n    https://github.com/haskell/cabal/wiki/2.2-migration-guide.\n
  \ * New Parsec-based parser for `.cabal` files is now the\n    default. This brings
  memory consumption and speed improvements, as\n    well as making new syntax extensions
  easier to implement.\n  * Support for common stanzas (#4751).\n  * Added elif-conditionals
  to `.cabal` syntax (#4750).\n  * The package license information can now be specified
  using the\n    SPDX syntax. This requires setting `cabal-version` to 2.2+ (#2547,\n
  \   #5050).\n  * Support for GHC's numeric -g debug levels (#4673).\n  * Compilation
  with section splitting is now supported via the\n    `--enable-split-sections` flag
  (#4819)\n  * Fields with mandatory commas (e.g. build-depends) may now have a\n
  \   leading or a trailing comma (either one, not both) (#4953)\n  * Added `virtual-modules`
  field, to allow modules that are not built\n    but registered (#4875).\n  * Use
  better defaulting for `build-type`; rename `PackageDescription`'s\n    `buildType`
  field to `buildTypeRaw` and introduce new `buildType`\n    function (#4958)\n  *
  `D.T.PackageDescription.allBuildInfo` now returns all build infos, not\n    only
  for buildable components (#5087).\n  * Removed `UnknownBuildType` constructor from
  `BuildType` (#5003).\n  * Added `HexFloatLiterals` to `KnownExtension`.\n  * Cabal
  will no longer try to build an empty set of `inputModules`\n    (#4890).\n  * `copyComponent`
  and `installIncludeFiles` will now look for\n    include headers in the build directory
  (`dist/build/...` by\n    default) as well (#4866).\n  * Added `cxx-options` and
  `cxx-sources` buildinfo fields for\n    separate compilation of C++ source files
  (#3700).\n  * Removed unused `--allow-newer`/`--allow-older` support from\n    `Setup
  configure` (#4527).\n  * Changed `FlagAssignment` to be an opaque `newtype` (#4849).\n
  \ * Changed `rawSystemStdInOut` to use proper type to represent\n    binary and
  textual data; new `Distribution.Utils.IOData` module;\n    removed obsolete `startsWithBOM`,
  `fileHasBOM`, `fromUTF8`,\n    and `toUTF8` functions; add new `toUTF8BS`/`toUTF8LBS`\n
  \   encoding functions. (#4666)\n  * Added a `cabal check` warning when the `.cabal`
  file name does\n    not match package name (#4592).\n  * The `ar` program now receives
  its arguments via a response file\n    (`@file`).  Old behaviour can be restored
  with\n    `--disable-response-files` argument to `configure` or\n    `install` (#4596).\n
  \ * Added `.Lens` modules, with optics for package description data\n    types (#4701).\n
  \ * Support for building with Win32 version 2.6 (#4835).\n  * Change `compilerExtensions`
  and `ghcOptExtensionMap` to contain\n    `Maybe Flag`s, since a supported extention
  can lack a flag (#4443).\n  * Pretty-printing of `.cabal` files is slightly different
  due to\n    parser changes. For an example, see\n    https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/cabal-devel/2017-December/010414.html.\n
  \ * `--hyperlink-source` now uses Haddock's hyperlinker backend when\n    Haddock
  is new enough, falling back to HsColour otherwise.\n  * `D.S.defaultHookedPackageDesc`
  has been deprecated in favour of\n    `D.S.findHookedPackageDesc` (#4874).\n  *
  `D.S.getHookedBuildInfo` now takes an additional parameter\n    specifying the build
  directory path (#4874).\n  * Emit warning when encountering unknown GHC versions
  (#415).\n\n### 2.0.1.1 [Mikhail Glushenkov](mailto:mikhail.glushenkov@gmail.com)
  December 2017\n\n  * Don't pass `other-modules` to stub executable for detailed-0.9\n
  \ (#4918).\n  * Hpc: Use relative .mix search paths (#4917).\n\n## 2.0.1.0 [Mikhail
  Glushenkov](mailto:mikhail.glushenkov@gmail.com) November 2017\n\n  * Support for
  GHC's numeric -g debug levels (#4673).\n  * Added a new `Distribution.Verbosity.modifyVerbosity`
  combinator\n    (#4724).\n  * Added a new `cabal check` warning about unused, undeclared
  or\n    non-Unicode flags.  Also, it warns about leading dash, which is\n    unusable
  but accepted if it's unused in conditionals. (#4687)\n  * Modify `allBuildInfo`
  to include foreign library info (#4763).\n  * Documentation fixes.\n\n### 2.0.0.2
  [Mikhail Glushenkov](mailto:mikhail.glushenkov@gmail.com) July 2017\n\n  * See http://coldwa.st/e/blog/2017-09-09-Cabal-2-0.html\n
  \   for more detailed release notes.\n  * The 2.0 migration guide gives advice on
  adapting Custom setup\n    scripts to backwards-incompatible changes in this release:\n
  \   https://github.com/haskell/cabal/wiki/2.0-migration-guide\n  * Add CURRENT_PACKAGE_VERSION
  to cabal_macros.h (#4319)\n  * Dropped support for versions of GHC earlier than
  6.12 (#3111).\n  * GHC compatibility window for the Cabal library has been extended\n
  \   to five years (#3838).\n  * Convenience/internal libraries are now supported
  (#269).\n    An internal library is declared using the stanza `library\n    'libname'`.
  \ Packages which use internal libraries can\n    result in multiple registrations;
  thus `--gen-pkg-config`\n    can now output a directory of registration scripts
  rather than\n    a single file.\n  * Backwards incompatible change to preprocessor
  interface:\n    the function in `PPSuffixHandler` now takes an additional\n    `ComponentLocalBuildInfo`
  specifying the build information\n    of the component being preprocessed.\n  *
  Backwards incompatible change to `cabal_macros.h` (#1893): we now\n    generate
  a macro file for each component which contains only\n    information about the direct
  dependencies of that component.\n    Consequently, `dist/build/autogen/cabal_macros.h`
  contains\n    only the macros for the library, and is not generated if a\n    package
  has no library; to find the macros for an executable\n    named `foobar`, look in
  `dist/build/foobar/autogen/cabal_macros.h`.\n    Similarly, if you used `autogenModulesDir`
  you should now\n    use `autogenComponentModulesDir`, which now requires a\n    `ComponentLocalBuildInfo`
  argument as well in order to\n    disambiguate which component the autogenerated
  files are for.\n  * Backwards incompatible change to `Component`: `TestSuite` and\n
  \   `Benchmark` no longer have `testEnabled` and\n    `benchmarkEnabled`.  If you
  used\n    `enabledTests` or `enabledBenchmarks`, please instead use\n    `enabledTestLBIs`
  and `enabledBenchLBIs`\n    (you will need a `LocalBuildInfo` for these functions.)\n
  \   Additionally, the semantics of `withTest` and `withBench`\n    have changed:
  they now iterate over all buildable\n    such components, regardless of whether
  or not they have\n    been enabled; if you only want enabled components,\n    use
  `withTestLBI` and `withBenchLBI`.\n    `finalizePackageDescription` is deprecated:\n
  \   its replacement `finalizePD` now takes an extra argument\n    `ComponentRequestedSpec`
  which specifies what components\n    are to be enabled: use this instead of modifying
  the\n    `Component` in a `GenericPackageDescription`.  (As\n    it's not possible
  now, `finalizePackageDescription`\n    will assume tests/benchmarks are disabled.)\n
  \   If you only need to test if a component is buildable\n    (i.e., it is marked
  buildable in the Cabal file)\n    use the new function `componentBuildable`.\n  *
  Backwards incompatible change to `PackageName` (#3896):\n    `PackageName` is now
  opaque; conversion to/from `String` now works\n    via (old) `unPackageName` and
  (new) `mkPackageName` functions.\n  * Backwards incompatible change to `ComponentId`
  (#3917):\n    `ComponentId` is now opaque; conversion to/from `String` now works\n
  \   via `unComponentId` and `mkComponentId` functions.\n  * Backwards incompatible
  change to `AbiHash` (#3921):\n    `AbiHash` is now opaque; conversion to/from `String`
  now works\n    via `unAbiHash` and `mkAbiHash` functions.\n  * Backwards incompatible
  change to `FlagName` (#4062):\n    `FlagName` is now opaque; conversion to/from
  `String` now works\n    via `unFlagName` and `mkFlagName` functions.\n  * Backwards
  incompatible change to `Version` (#3905):\n    Version is now opaque; conversion
  to/from `[Int]` now works\n    via `versionNumbers` and `mkVersion` functions.\n
  \ * Add support for `--allow-older` (dual to `--allow-newer`) (#3466)\n  * Improved
  an error message for process output decoding errors\n  (#3408).\n  * `getComponentLocalBuildInfo`,
  `withComponentsInBuildOrder`\n    and `componentsInBuildOrder` are deprecated in
  favor of a\n    new interface in `Distribution.Types.LocalBuildInfo`.\n  * New `autogen-modules`
  field. Modules that are built automatically at\n    setup, like Paths_PACKAGENAME
  or others created with a build-type\n    custom, appear on `other-modules` for the
  Library, Executable,\n    Test-Suite or Benchmark stanzas or also on `exposed-modules`
  for\n    libraries but are not really on the package when distributed. This\n    makes
  commands like sdist fail because the file is not found, so with\n    this new field
  modules that appear there are treated the same way as\n    Paths_PACKAGENAME was
  and there is no need to create complex build\n    hooks. Just add the module names
  on `other-modules` and\n    `exposed-modules` as always and on the new `autogen-modules`
  besides.\n  (#3656).\n  * New `./Setup configure` flag `--cabal-file`, allowing
  multiple\n  `.cabal` files in a single directory (#3553). Primarily intended for\n
  \ internal use.\n  * Macros in `cabal_macros.h` are now ifndef'd, so that they\n
  \ don't cause an error if the macro is already defined. (#3041)\n  * `./Setup configure`
  now accepts a single argument specifying\n    the component to be configured.  The
  semantics of this mode\n    of operation are described in\n    <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/4>\n
  \ * Internal `build-tools` dependencies are now added to PATH\n    upon invocation
  of GHC, so that they can be conveniently\n    used via `-pgmF`. (#1541)\n  * Add
  support for new caret-style version range operator `^>=` (#3705)\n  * Verbosity
  `-v` now takes an extended format which allows\n    specifying exactly what you
  want to be logged.  The format is\n    `[silent|normal|verbose|debug] flags`, where
  flags is a space\n    separated list of flags. At the moment, only the flags\n    +callsite
  and +callstack are supported; these report the\n    call site/stack of a logging
  output respectively (these\n    are only supported if Cabal is built with GHC 8.0/7.10.2\n
  \   or greater, respectively).\n  * New `Distribution.Utils.ShortText.ShortText`
  type for representing\n    short text strings compactly (#3898)\n  * Cabal no longer
  supports using a version bound to disambiguate\n    between an internal and external
  package (#4020).  This should\n    not affect many people, as this mode of use already
  did not\n    work with the dependency solver.\n  * Support for \"foreign libraries\"
  (#2540), which are Haskell\n    libraries intended to be used by foreign languages
  like C.\n    Foreign libraries only work with GHC 7.8 and later.\n  * Added a technical
  preview version of integrated doctest support (#4480).\n  * Added a new `scope`
  field to the executable stanza. Executables\n    with `scope: private` get installed
  into\n    $libexecdir/$libexecsubdir. Additionally $libexecdir now has a\n    subdir
  structure similar to $lib(sub)dir to allow installing\n    private executables of
  different packages and package versions\n    alongside one another.  Private executables
  are those that are\n    expected to be run by other programs rather than users.

  Jones](mailto:ijones@syntaxpolice.org) Sun Jan 16 2005\n\n  * Much thanks to all
  the awesome fptools hackers who have been\n  working hard to build the Haskell Cabal!\n\n
  \ * __Interface Changes__:\n\n    * __WARNING__: this is a pre-release and the interfaces
  are still\n    likely to change until we reach a 1.0 release.\n\n    * Instead of
  Package.description, you should name your\n    description files <something>.cabal.
  \ In particular, we suggest\n    that you name it <packagename>.cabal, but this
  is not enforced\n    (yet).  Multiple `.cabal` files in the same directory is an
  error,\n    at least for now.\n\n    * `./setup install --install-prefix` is gone.
  \ Use `./setup copy`\n    `--copy-prefix` instead.\n\n    * The `Modules` field
  is gone.  Use `hidden-modules`,\n    `exposed-modules`, and `executable-modules`.\n\n
  \   * `Build-depends` is now a package-only field, and can't go into\n    executable
  stanzas.  Build-depends is a package-to-package\n    relationship.\n\n    * Some
  new fields.  Use the Source.\n\n  * __New Features__\n\n    * Cabal is now included
  as a package in the CVS version of\n    fptools.  That means it'll be released as
  `-package Cabal` in\n    future versions of the compilers, and if you are a bleeding-edge\n
  \   user, you can grab it from the CVS repository with the compilers.\n\n    * Hugs
  compatibility and NHC98 compatibility should both be\n    improved.\n\n    * Hooks
  Interface / Autoconf compatibility: Most of the hooks\n    interface is hidden for
  now, because it's not finalized.  I have\n    exposed only `defaultMainWithHooks`
  and `defaultUserHooks`.  This\n    allows you to use a ./configure script to preprocess\n
  \   `foo.buildinfo`, which gets merged with `foo.cabal`.  In future\n    releases,
  we'll expose UserHooks, but we're definitely going to\n    change the interface
  to those.  The interface to the two functions\n    I've exposed should stay the
  same, though.\n\n    * ./setup haddock is a baby feature which pre-processes the\n
  \   source code with hscpp and runs haddock on it.  This is brand new\n    and hardly
  tested, so you get to knock it around and see what you\n    think.\n\n    * Some
  commands now actually implement verbosity.\n\n    * The preprocessors have been
  tested a bit more, and seem to work\n    OK.  Please give feedback if you use these.\n\n----\n\n#
  0.3  [Isaac Jones](mailto:ijones@syntaxpolice.org) Sun Jan 16 2005\n\n  * Unstable
  snapshot release\n  * From now on, stable releases are even.\n\n----\n\n# 0.2  [Isaac
  Jones](mailto:ijones@syntaxpolice.org)\n\n  * Adds more HUGS support and preprocessor
  support.\n"

description: ! "The Cabal library package\n=========================\n\nSee the [Cabal
  web site] for more information.\n\nIf you also want the `cabal` command-line program,
  you need the\n[cabal-install] package in addition to this library.\n\n[cabal-install]:
  ../cabal-install/README.md\n\nInstalling the Cabal library\n============================\n\nIf
  you already have the `cabal` program\n---------------------------------------\n\nIn
  this case run:\n\n    $ cabal install\n\nHowever, if you do not have an existing
  version of the `cabal` program,\nyou first must install the Cabal library. To avoid
  this bootstrapping\nproblem, you can install the Cabal library directly as described
  below.\n\n\nInstalling as a user (no root or administrator access)\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n
  \   ghc -threaded --make Setup\n    ./Setup configure --user\n    ./Setup build\n
  \   ./Setup install\n\nNote the use of the `--user` flag at the configure step.\n\nCompiling
  'Setup' rather than using `runghc Setup` is much faster and\nworks on Windows. For
  all packages other than Cabal itself, it is fine\nto use `runghc`.\n\nThis will
  install into `$HOME/.cabal/` on Unix and into\n`Documents and Settings\\$User\\Application
  Data\\cabal\\` on Windows.\nIf you want to install elsewhere, use the `--prefix=`
  flag at the\nconfigure step.\n\n\nInstalling as root or Administrator\n-----------------------------------\n\n
  \   ghc -threaded --make Setup\n    ./Setup configure\n    ./Setup build\n    sudo
  ./Setup install\n\nCompiling Setup rather than using `runghc Setup` is much faster
  and\nworks on Windows. For all packages other than Cabal itself, it is fine\nto
  use `runghc`.\n\nThis will install into `/usr/local` on Unix, and on Windows it
  will\ninstall into `$ProgramFiles/Haskell`. If you want to install elsewhere,\nuse
  the `--prefix=` flag at the configure step.\n\n\nUsing older versions of GHC and
  Cabal\n======================================\n\nIt is recommended that you leave
  any pre-existing version of Cabal\ninstalled. In particular, it is *essential* you
  keep the version that\ncame with GHC itself, since other installed packages require
  it (for\ninstance, the \"ghc\" API package).\n\nPrior to GHC 6.4.2, however, GHC
  did not deal particularly well with\nhaving multiple versions of packages installed
  at once. So if you are\nusing GHC 6.4.1 or older and you have an older version of
  Cabal\ninstalled, you should probably remove it by running:\n\n    $ ghc-pkg unregister
  Cabal\n\nor, if you had Cabal installed only for your user account, run:\n\n    $
  ghc-pkg unregister Cabal --user\n\nThe `filepath` dependency\n=========================\n\nCabal
  uses the [filepath] package, so it must be installed first.\nGHC version 6.6.1 and
  later come with `filepath`, however, earlier\nversions do not by default. If you
  do not already have `filepath`,\nyou need to install it. You can use any existing
  version of Cabal to do\nthat. If you have neither Cabal nor `filepath`, it is slightly\nharder
  but still possible.\n\nUnpack Cabal and `filepath` into separate directories. For
  example:\n\n    tar -xzf filepath-1.1.0.0.tar.gz\n    tar -xzf Cabal-1.6.0.0.tar.gz\n\n
  \   # rename to make the following instructions simpler:\n    mv filepath-1.1.0.0/
  filepath/\n    mv Cabal-1.6.0.0/ Cabal/\n\n    cd Cabal\n    ghc -i../filepath -cpp
  --make Setup.hs -o ../filepath/setup\n    cd ../filepath/\n    ./setup configure
  --user\n    ./setup build\n    ./setup install\n\nThis installs `filepath` so that
  you can install Cabal with the normal\nmethod.\n\n[filepath]: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/filepath\n\nMore

  and feature requests to Cabal's [bug tracker].\n\n\nYour help\n---------\n\nTo help
  Cabal's development, it is enormously helpful to know from\nCabal's users what their
  most pressing problems are with Cabal and\n[Hackage]. You may have a favourite Cabal
  bug or limitation. Look at\nCabal's [bug tracker]. Ensure that the problem is reported
  there and\nadequately described. Comment on the issue to report how much of a\nproblem
  the bug is for you. Subscribe to the issues's notifications to\ndiscussed requirements
  and keep informed on progress. For feature\nrequests, it is helpful if there is
  a description of how you would\nexpect to interact with the new feature.\n\n[Hackage]:
