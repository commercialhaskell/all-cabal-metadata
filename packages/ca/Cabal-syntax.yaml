  This library provides tools for reading and manipulating the .cabal file
  format.

  Version 3.6 (unlike the following versions) is a dummy package that
  prevents module name clases between Cabal and Cabal-syntax if used together
  with a Cabal flag as described below.

  In Cabal-3.7 this package was split off. To avoid module name clashes, you
  can add this to your .cabal file:

  > flag Cabal-syntax
  >   description: Use the new Cabal-syntax package
  >   default: False
  >   manual: False
  >
  > library
  >   -- ...
  >   if flag(Cabal-syntax)
  >     build-depends: Cabal-syntax >= 3.7
  >   else
  >     build-depends: Cabal < 3.7, Cabal-syntax < 3.7

  This will default to the older build, but will allow consumers to opt-in to
  the newer libraries by requiring Cabal or Cabal-syntax >= 3.7
