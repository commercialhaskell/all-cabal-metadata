description: |-
  Mudbath is continuous deployment server which integrates with GitHub. It
  listens for deployment events and when it receives one, executes a shell
  script. It reports progress back to GitHub in the form of deployment
  status updates.
  Mudbath can also send notifications to Slack if the proper keys are
  provided. Other notification sinks can be easily added if needed.
