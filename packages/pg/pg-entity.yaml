  # Revision history for Entity

  ## 0.0.3.0 -- 2022-10-30

  * Fix compilation with resource-pool <0.3 (#51)

  ## 0.0.2.0 -- 2022-08-27

  This is an experimental release

  * Add `queryOne_`, which takes no params and returns 0 or 1 results.
  * Add `FieldModifiers` deriving option, which takes multiple modifiers:
    * `StripPrefix (prefix :: Symbol)`: You can remove a certain prefix from your field names
    * `CamelTo (separator :: Symbol)` and its variants, `CamelToSnake` and `CamelToKebab`: Transform field names written
    in CamelCase to snake\_case, kebab-case, or with a custom separator.
  * Remove redundant metadata about the query nature when logging the query
  * Add `selectOneWhereIn` that can match a row's column in a value of user-provided values
  * Add `selectOrderBy` to specify a vector of sorting specs (field + sorting keyword) with your select.
  * Fix primary key detection in generic deriving
  * Remove `withPool'`.
  * When using `resource-pool-0.3`, the type of `withPool` reflects the removal of `MonadBaseControl` from the upstream.
  * The `prod` Cabal flag is introduced. At this time, it disables the stdout logging of queries
  * Add an `upsert` function
  * Stop filtering out unknown fields passed to `_where`. PostgreSQL will report them better than we do.

  ## 0.0.1.0 -- 2021-11-05

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  />\n</a>\n</p>\n\nThis library is a pleasant layer on top of [postgresql-simple][pg-simple]
  to safely expand the fields of a table when\nwriting SQL queries.  \nIt aims to
  be a convenient middle-ground between rigid ORMs and hand-rolled SQL query strings.
  Here is its philosophy:\n\n* The serialisation/deserialisation part is left to the
  consumer, so you have to go with your own FromRow/ToRow instances.\n  You are encouraged
  to adopt data types in your application that model your business domain, rather
  than restrict yourself within the limits of what\n  an SQL schema can represent.
  Use an intermediate Data Access Object (DAO) that can easily be serialised and deserialised\n
  \ to and from a SQL schema, to and from which you will morph your business data-types.\n*
  Illegal states are made harder (but not impossible) to represent. Generic deriving
  of entities is encouraged, and\n  quasi-quoters are provided to denote fields in
  a safer way. \n* Escape hatches are provided at every level. The types that are
  manipulated are Query for which an `IsString` instance exists.\n  Don't force yourself
  to use the higher-level API if the lower-level combinators work for you, and if
  those don't either, “Just Write SQL”™.\n\nIts dependency footprint is optimised
  for my own setups, and as such it makes use of [text][text], [vector][vector] and\n[pg-transact][pg-transact].\n\n\n\nTable

  Installation\n\nAt present time, `pg-entity` is published on Hackage but not on
  Stackage. To use it in your projects, add it in your\ncabal file like this:\n\n```\npg-entity
  ^>= 0.0\n```\n\nor in your `stack.yaml` file:\n\n```\nextra-deps:\n  - pg-entity-0.0.4.0\n```\n\n*

  Documentation\n\nYou will find the Tutorial [here][docs-url], and you will find
  below a short showcase of the library.\n\nThis library aims to be thoroughly tested,
  by the means of Oleg Grenrus' [cabal-docspec][docspec]\nand more traditional tests
  for database roundtrips.\n\nI aim to produce and maintain a decent documentation,
  therefore do not hesitate to raise an issue if you feel that\nsomething is badly
  explained and should be improved.\n\n\n### Escape hatches\n\nSafe SQL generation
  is a complex subject, and it is far from being the objective of this library. The
  main topic it\naddresses is listing the fields of a table, which is definitely something
  easier. This is why every level of this wrapper\nis fully exposed, so that you can
  drop down a level at your convience.\n\nIt is my personal belief, firmly rooted
  in experience, that we should not aim to produce statically-checked SQL and have\nit
  \"verified\" by the compiler. The techniques that would allow that in Haskell are
  still far from being optimised and\nergonomic. As such, this library makes no effort
  to produce semantically valid SQL queries, because one would have to\nencode the
  semantics of SQL in the type system (or in a rule engine of some sort), and this
  is clearly not the kind of\nthings I want to spend my youth on.\n\nEach function
  is tested for its output with doctests, and the ones that cannot (due to database
  connections) are tested\nin the more traditional test-suite.\n\nThe conclusion is
  : Test your DB queries. Test the encoding/decoding. Make roundtrip tests for your
  data-structures.\n\n## Acknowledgements \n\nI wish to thank\n\n* Clément Delafargue,
  whose [anorm-pg-entity][anorm-pg-entity] library and its [initial port in Haskell][entity-blogpost-fretlink]\n
  \ are the spiritual parents of this library\n* Koz Ross, for his piercing eyes and
  his immense patience\n* Joe Kachmar, who enlightened me many times\n\n[docs]: https://img.shields.io/badge/Tutorial%20and%20Guides-pg--entity-blueviolet\n[docs-url]:
