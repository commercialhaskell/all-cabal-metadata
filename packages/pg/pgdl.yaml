  # pgdl
  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sifmelcara/pgdl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sifmelcara/pgdl)
  ## What can this program do?

  pgdl is a program for viewing and accessing directory listing webpage in terminal.

  Browsing files on directory listings like
  [this](https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/)
  is often annoying and hard to find the files we want.

  pgdl provids a simple interface for browsing and downloading the files in web-engine-generated directory listings.

  ## Installing

  by cabal:
  ```shell
  cabal update
  cabal install pgdl
  ```
  In case of the versions of dependencies cannot be resolved, you may need to `rm -rf ~/.ghc`.

  via nix:
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/sifmelcara/pgdl.git
  cd pgdl
  nix-env -i -f pgdl.nix
  ```

  ## example usage

  ```shell
  pgdl https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/
  ```
  or simply type `pgdl` if you have set servpath attribute in the config file (config file will be explained later).

  ## Shortcut keys

  '/' for file searching

  press Enter to download the selected file

  press 'q' to quit the program

  press 'd' to delete currently selected file (which have been downloaded)

  press Meta+Enter to resume the download progress of the currently selected file (like `curl -C` does)


  ## Config file

  If you want to access webpage that uses basic authentication, you should at least set *username* attribute in config file.
  (if password is not set, you will need to enter password manually when you launch the program)

  (~/.pgdl)
  ```bash
  # example:
  username = "jack"      # should be set if the webpage have basic authentication
  password = "mypassw"   # optional
  servpath = "example.org/videodir/" # default server location, optional
  localdir = "/home/jack/Downloads/" # where to store downloaded files, optional
  ```
