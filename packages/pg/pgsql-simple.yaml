  # Work in progress

  I am currently porting the MySQL parts to PostgreSQL, hoping to
  maintain the rest of the API verbatim.

  # pgsql-simple: mid-level bindings to PostgreSQL servers

  This library is a mid-level Haskell binding to PostgreSQL servers. It
  is aimed at speed and ease of use.

  # Licensing

  This library is BSD-licensed.

  # Authors

  This library is written and maintained by Chris Done,
  <chrisdone@gmail.com>.

  This library is also directly forked from mysql-simple, written and
  maintained by Bryan O'Sullivan, <bos@mailrank.com>, with the MySQL
  parts changed to PostgreSQL, in order to have a consistent API.
