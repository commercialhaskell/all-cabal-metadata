description: "# PGF2\n\nThis is a Haskell binding to the PGF runtime written in C.\n\nThe
  exposed modules are:\n\n- `PGF2`: a user API similar to Python and Java APIs\n-
  `PGF2.Internal`: an internal module with FFI definitions for the relevant C functions\n\n##
  How to compile\n\n**Important:** You must have the C runtime already installed and
  available on your system.\nSee <https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-core/blob/master/src/runtime/c/INSTALL>\n\nOnce
  the runtine is installed, you can install the library to your global Cabal installation:\n\n```\ncabal
  install pgf2 --extra-lib-dirs=/usr/local/lib\n```\n\nor add it to your `stack.yaml`
  file:\n\n```yaml\nextra-deps:\n  - pgf2\nextra-lib-dirs:\n  - /usr/local/lib\n```\n\n##
  How to use\n\nSimply import `PGF2` in your Haskell program.\nThe Cabal infrastructure
  will make sure to tell the compiler where to find the relevant modules.\n\n## Example\n\n```haskell\nmodule
  Main where\n\nimport PGF2\nimport qualified Data.Map as Map\n\nmain = do\n  pgf
  <- readPGF \"App12.pgf\"\n  let Just eng = Map.lookup \"AppEng\" (languages pgf)\n
  \ \n  -- Parsing\n  let res = parse eng (startCat pgf) \"this is a small theatre\"\n
  \ let ParseOk ((tree,prob):rest) = res\n  print tree\n  \n  -- Linearisation\n  let
  Just expr = readExpr \"AdjCN (PositA red_A) (UseN theatre_N)\"\n  let s = linearize
  eng expr\n  print s\n```\n"
