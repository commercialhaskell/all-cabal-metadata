changelog: "1.26.1\n\n* TECHNICALLY BREAKING CHANGES: [Simplify `⫽` within projection](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1283)
  / [Simplify nested record projections](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1307)\n
  \   * These are technically breaking changes because you will need to update\n      integrity
  checks that protect code simplified in this way\n    * We're not bumping the major
  version since the likelihood that you're\n      affected is quite low\n* BUG FIX:
  [Fix performance regression](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1335)\n
  \   * This change fixes the performance regression introduced in the previous\n
  \     release (version 1.26.0)\n* BUG FIX: [Prevent REPL from inserting inferred
  `Sort`s into context](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1318)\n    *
  This protects the REPL from getting hosed if you define an expression\n      using
  `:let` that has an inferred type of `Sort`\n* NEW FEATURE: Improved `Inject`/`Interpret`
  support for 1-field constructors - ([#1315](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1315)
  / [#1321](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1321))\n    * This adds
  a new `singletonConstructors` field to `InterpretOptions` that\n      lets you control
  what Dhall type 1-field Haskell constructors correspond\n      to\n    * The default
  (`Wrapped`) is backwards compatible with the old behavior\n    * The `Smart` option
  is probably what you want: it will strip the\n      Haskell constructor from the
  Dhall type if the constructor has one\n      anonymous field\n    * The `Bare` option
  always strips 1-field Haskell constructors from the\n      Dhall type\n* NEW FEATURE:
  `--censor` flag that disables source code display ([#1312](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1312)
  / [#1329](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1329))\n    * Use this
  flag when you don't want sensitive `Text` literals showing up in\n      parsing
  or type-checking error messages\n* [Format record fields more compactly if they
  fit on 1 line](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1314)\n    * The
  formatter will now format record fields on a field-by-field basis to\n      avoid
  unnecessary vertical sprawl of formatted records\n    * Specifically, record fields
  that fit on one line will now be formatted\n      on one line\n* [Add `--quiet`
  option to `dhall type`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1325)\n
  \   * This lets you use `dhall type` in \"check only\" mode (e.g. for CI for\n      for
  development feedback)\n* Improved GHCJS support - ([#1311](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1311)
  / [#1330](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1330))\n* [Fix all executables
  to accept `--version`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1334)\n
  \   * Note that the `dhall version` subcommand is still supported, too\n* [New `Dhall.Version`
  module](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1332)\n* [Don't normalize
  inferred types](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1317)\n    * This
  fixes `dhall type` to more accurately follow the standard\n* [Initial changes for
  GHC 8.8 support](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1324)\n* [Fix
  Haddock formatting for `dhallFromJSON`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1316)\n\n1.26.0\n\n*
  [Supports version 10.0.0 of the standard](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/releases/tag/v10.0.0)\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE TO THE LANGUAGE: [Remove old union literal syntax](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1176)\n
  \   * Union literals of the form `< x = e | ... >` are no longer valid\n    * For
  more details, see: [Migration: Deprecation of old union literal syntax](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/wiki/Migration%3A-Deprecation-of-old-union-literal-syntax)\n
  \   * Also see the [changelog for standard version 10.0.0](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/releases/tag/v10.0.0)
  for more details\n* BREAKING CHANGE TO THE API: [Change `X` to be a type synonym
  for `Data.Void`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1172)\n    * This
  is a breaking change if you were previously pattern matching on the\n      `X` constructor.
  \ You can replace that with the use of `Data.Void.absurd`\n* BREAKING CHANGE TO
  THE API: [Treat multi-`let`s as syntactic sugar](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1242)\n
  \   * This is a breaking change because the `Let` constructor now only stores\n
  \     one `Binding` instead of a `NonEmpty` list of `Binding`s\n* PERFORMANCE REGRESSION
  & TECHNICALLY BREAKING CHANGE TO THE LANGUAGE: [Dependent types](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1164)\n
  \   * You can now write functions from terms to types\n    * There is also now language
  support for tests of the form\n      `assert : x === y`\n    * This deteriorates
  the performance of large multi-`let` expressions\n      (See: [#1306](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/issues/1306))\n
  \   * Splitting large multi-`let` expressions into smaller files may mitigate\n
  \     the problem as a work-around for now\n    * Follow [#1129](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/issues/1129)\n
  \     for work to fix this performance regression\n    * This is also a technically
  breaking change because `assert` is now a\n      reserved keyword\n    * See the
  [changelog for standard version 10.0.0](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/releases/tag/v10.0.0)
  for more details\n* TECHNICALLY BREAKING CHANGE TO THE LANGUAGE: [Add `Natural/subtract`
  built-in](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1133)\n    * The language
  now supports machine subtraction, which can be used to\n      support several other
  high-performance operations (like `Natural`\n      comparisons)\n    * This is a
  technically breaking change if you used `Natural/subtract` as an\n      identifier
  in your code\n    * See the [changelog for standard version 10.0.0](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/releases/tag/v10.0.0)
  for more details\n* TECHNICALLY BREAKING CHANGE TO THE LANGUAGE: [More simplifications
  for field selection](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1174)\n    *
  Now the interpreter will more intelligently simplify certain field\n      projections\n
  \   * For example: `λ(x : { a : Bool, b : Bool }) → (x ⫽ { c = 0 }).{ a, c }.c`\n
  \     will now simplify to `λ(x : { a : Bool, b : Bool }) → 0 `\n    * This is a
  technically breaking change because you will need to update\n      integrity checks
  that protect code simplified in this way\n    * See the [changelog for standard
  version 10.0.0](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/releases/tag/v10.0.0) for
  more details\n* TECHNICALLY BREAKING CHANGE TO THE LANGUAGE: [Simplify `⫽` when
  its arguments are equivalent](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1196)\n
  \   * This is a technically breaking change for the same reason: this will\n      perturb
  semantic integrity checks for affected code\n    * See the [changelog for standard
  version 10.0.0](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/releases/tag/v10.0.0) for
  more details\n* NEW FEATURE: [Restore support for records containing both types
  and terms](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1173)\n    * In other
  words `{ foo = 1, bar = Bool }` is now valid again\n    * This means that you now
  can export a single package containing both types\n      and terms\n    * See the
  [changelog for standard version 10.0.0](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/releases/tag/v10.0.0)
  for more details\n* [`dhall format` now preserves `let` comments](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1273)\n
  \   * `dhall` format will now preserve comments in the following locations of\n
  \     a `let` binding:\n    * `let {- HERE -} x {- HERE -} : {- HERE -} Bool = {-
  HERE -} True in x`\n    * This support handles both single-line and multi-line comments
  and also\n      takes care of correctly indenting/dedenting them\n    * Note that
  comments before the `let` keyword are still not preserved\n      (unless it is the
  beginning of the file)\n* [Add API support for marshalling recursive types](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1195)\n
  \   * You can now marshal recursive types from Dhall into Haskell using the\n      newly-added
  utilities\n    * See also: [#1298](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1298)\n*
  [New `:help` command for `dhall repl`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1237)\n*
  [New `--no-cache` flag](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1290)\n
  \   * You can now disable use of the cache with this flag\n    * This comes in handy
  if you want to disable α-normalization for imports\n      protected by a semantic
  integrity check\n* Bug fixes\n    * [Fix `isNormalized` for field selections](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1210)\n
  \   * [Simplify `Natural/subtract` when its arguments are equivalent](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1220)\n
  \   * [Fix `NaN` to be judgmentally equivalent to itself](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1231)\n
  \   * [Fix `Inject` instance for lists](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1261)\n
  \   * [Fix typechecking of `toMap`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1279)\n*
  Performance optimizations\n    * [Optimize a few `Set` instances](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1184)\n
  \   * [Remove some redundant sorting during normalization](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1228)\n*
  Improvements to error messages\n    * [Improve error reporting for failed remote
  imports](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1188)\n    * [Improve
  HTTP errors](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1253)\n* Improvements
  to formatting\n    * [Indent function arguments when formatting](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1167)\n
  \   * [Prefer unquoted URLs](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1235)\n
  \   * [Strip leading whitespace](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1270)\n*
  Improvements to diffs\n    * [Fix diffs for lists](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1213)\n
  \   * [Improve diff for non-empty lists](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1244)\n
  \   * [Small fixes to `dhall diff`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1263)\n*
  Improvements to documentation\n    * [Fix documentation for `UnionInputType`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1230)\n
  \   * [Document support for caching protected imports](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1247)\n*
  Improvements to command-line interface\n    * [Improve description of `dhall lint`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1264)\n
  \   * [Change `dhall type` to resolve imports](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1281)\n\n1.25.0\n\n*
  Supports version 9.0.0 of the standard\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/releases/tag/v9.0.0\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE: Remove support for old-style `List`-like `Optional` literals\n
  \   * List-like `Optional` Literals (i.e. `[ 1 ] : Optional Natural`) are no\n      longer
  valid\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1002\n* BREAKING
  CHANGE: Add support for semi-semantic caching\n    * This change significantly improves
  the performance of imports\n    * This change also automatically caches imports
  without an integrity check\n    * This changes several types in `Dhall.Import` to
  support this new\n      feature\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1113\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE: Implement new Unicode braced escape sequence\n    * Escape sequences
  encoding surrogate pairs are no longer valid\n    * Instead, characters previously
  encoded as surrogate pairs can instead be\n      encoded as a braced sequence\n
  \   * For example: \"\\uD834\\uDD1E\" must now be written as \"\\u{1D11E}\"\n    *
  See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/987\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1104\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE: Make the type of extract richer:\n    * `Dhall.extract` can now
  return a detailed error instead of just a `Maybe`\n    * This is a breaking chnage
  because the type of `extract` changed\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1011\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE: Add support for importing expressions `as Location`\n    * This
  is a breaking change because a new `Location` constructor was added\n      to `ImportMode`\n
  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1019\n* BREAKING CHANGE:
  Switch `Var` to use an `Int`\n    * This is a performance improvement, but also
  a breaking change since the\n      `Integer` in the `Var` constructor was changed
  to an `Int`\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1044\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE: Add new `toMap` keyword\n    * This is a breaking change to the
  API because a new `ToMap` constructor\n      was added to the `Expr` type\n    *
  This is also a technically breaking change to the language because `toMap`\n      is
  now a reserved keyword, although most code should be unaffected in\n      practice\n
  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1041\n* BREAKING CHANGE:
  Sort the fields of a record projection during normalization\n    * This is a technically
  breaking change to the language because any\n      expressions with an uninterpreted
  record projection will have a different\n      semantic integrity check.  However,
  most could should be unaffected in\n      practice\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1111\n*
  BUG FIX: Fix substitution into record projection by type\n    * An expression like
  this one was being incorrectly rejected:\n      `let e = { a = 10, b = \"Text\"
  } let s = { a : Natural } in e.(s)`, which\n      this change fixes\n    * See:
  https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1012\n* BUG FIX: Reject record
  projection when there is a field type mismatch\n    * Record projection by type
  was previously not checking the expected\n      field types, which this change fixes\n
  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1027\n* BUG FIX: Fix
  linting of unused let bindings\n    * Certain let bindings were not correctly detected
  as unused, which this\n      change fixes\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1001\n*
  BUG FIX: Fix `--file` option\n    * The `--file` option from the previous release
  did not work, due to not\n      computing relative paths correctly, which this change
  fixes\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1004\n* BUG FIX:
  Minor fix to `dhall diff`\n    * `dhall diff` was incorrectly displaying spurious
  differences for\n      identical lists that were function arguments, which this
  change fixes\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1006\n*
  BUG FIX: Allow `Sort` as type annotation\n    * This should have been implemented
  in the previous release as part of\n      supporting version 8.0.0 of the standard,
  but was missed\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1024\n*
  BUG FIX: `Dhall.Map`: Reflect original key ordering in `Ord` instance\n    * `Dhall.Map`
  now considers key order when comparing `Map`s, which it should\n      have done
  before, but didn't\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1050\n*
  BUG FIX: Consistently format multi-line strings\n    * The formatter now formats
  naked multi-line strings the same as nested\n      multi-line strings\n    * Specifically,
  naked multi-line strings can now be formatted on a single\n      (just like nested
  multi-line strings)\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1056\n*
  BUG FIX: Make `isNormalized` consistent with `normalize`\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1115\n*
  BUG FIX: Make `normalizeWithM` consistent with `normalize`\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1126\n*
  BUG FIX: Fix import alternatives to recover from type errors\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1152\n*
  Feature: Semi-semantic caching\n    * The Haskell implementation now implicitly
  caches *all* local imports, not\n      just imports frozen by integrity checks,
  so that you don't have to freeze\n      them when doing local development\n    *
  These cached imports are still correctly invalidated if they or any of\n      their
  dependencies change\n    * This new implicit cache is stored underneath `~/.cache/dhall-haskell`
  by\n      default\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1154\n*
  Feature: New `dhall text` subcommand\n    * This new subcommand supersedes the old
  `dhall-to-text` executable\n* Feature: Add `instance Lift (Expr s a)`\n    * See:
  https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1119\n* Fixes and improvements
  to error messages:\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1030\n
  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1137\n* Fixes and improvements
  to tests:\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1155\n    *
  See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1159\n* Performance improvements\n
  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1036\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1051\n
  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1048\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1057\n
  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1065\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1066\n
  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1085\n\n1.24.0\n\n*
  Supports version 8.0.0 of the standard\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/releases/tag/v8.0.0\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE: Allow tabs and blank lines in multi-line strings\n    * Blank lines
  are now ignored for the purpose of dedenting multiline strings\n    * Lines with
  leading tabs (or mixed tabs and spaces) are now dedented, too,\n      so long as
  they all share the same prefix\n    * This is technically a breaking change, but
  unlikely to affect programs\n      in practice, especially if they were formatted
  with `dhall format`.  This\n      change mainly affects programs that were not indented
  correctly.\n    * See the changelog for standard version 8.0.0 for more details\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE: Simplify bare interpolations\n    * Expressions like `λ(x : Text)
  → \"${x}\"` now simplify to `λ(x : Text) → x`\n    * This is a technically breaking
  change because it changes how these sorts\n      of expressions are serialized.
  \ This does not affect semantic integrity\n      checks and the new simplified expressions
  are extensionally equivalent to\n      their older counterpart expressions.\n    *
  See the changelog for standard version 8.0.0 for more details\n* BREAKING CHANGE:
  Encode integrity check as multihash\n    * Semantic integrity checks are now encoded
  using the multihash spec\n    * This is a technically breaking change that does
  not perturb the hash for\n      user-facing semantic integrity checks.  This only
  affects how expressions\n      with unresolved imports are serialized, but semantic
  integrity checks are\n      only computed for fully-resolved imports.\n    * See
  the changelog for standard version 8.0.0 for more details\n* BUG FIX: Fix type-checker
  to reject invalid record type annotations\n    * e.g. `{ x = 1 } : { x : Text }`
  was not properly rejected by the type\n      checker\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/965\n*
  BUG FIX: Custom header forwarding fixed\n    * Forwarding custom headers could previously
  fail in various ways, such as:\n        * Cyclic imports leading to endless network
  requests\n        * Resolving a non-existent import for the custom headers\n        *
  Resolving an existing but incorrect import for the custom headers\n    * This change
  fixes that by forwarding custom headers by value instead of\n      by reference\n
  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/967\n* BUG FIX: Fix
  GHCJS support\n    * `Natural/fold` was broken in version 1.22, which this change
  fixes\n    * Specifically, it would hang for `Natural` numbers greater than 1\n
  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/985\n* BUG FIX: `dhall
  diff` no longer double-prints key-value separators\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/952\n*
  Feature: Record projection by expression\n    * You can now project out a subset
  of record fields by the expected type\n    * `let t = { x : Natural } let p = {
  x = 1, y = 2 } in p.(t) = { x = 1 }`\n    * See the changelog for standard version
  8.0.0 for more details\n* Feature: Inline headers\n    * You no longer need to specify
  custom headers in a separate import.  You\n      can now specify them inline within
  the same file.\n    * e.g.: `https://example.com/x using [ { header = \"Foo\", value
  = \"Bar\" } ]`\n    * See the changelog for standard version 8.0.0 for more details\n*
  Feature: Allow `Sort` as a type annotation\n    * An expression such as `Kind →
  Kind : Sort` will now type-check\n    * `Sort` is still disallowed outside of a
  type annotation\n    * See the changelog for standard version 8.0.0 for more details\n*
  Feature: Allow self-describe-cbor when decoding\n    * Dhall expressions serialized
  as CBOR can be tagged to describe themselves\n      as CBOR without affecting decoding\n
  \   * See the changelog for standard version 8.0.0 for more details\n* Feature:
  New `--file` option for `dhall` commands\n    * In other words, instead of `dhall
  <<< './some/file` you can now use\n      `dhall --file some/file`\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/949\n*
  Feature: New `--cache` flag for `dhall freeze` command\n    * This automates the
  idiom used by the Prelude to optimistically cache\n      imports but gracefully
  degrade if the semantic integrity check fails\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/980\n*
  Feature: Add `:clear` command to `dhall repl`\n    * This deletes previous bindings
  from the history so that they can be\n      garbage collected\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/966\n*
  Feature: New `chunkExprs` `Traversal` added to `Dhall.Core`\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/954\n*
  Feature: New `Dhall.Optics` module\n    * This re-exports some convenient @lens@
  utilities used internally for\n      packages trying to avoid a @lens@ dependency\n
  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/986\n* More GHC 8.8
  support\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/961\n\n1.23.0\n\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE: Fix marshaling union literals\n    * 1.22.0 introduced two separate
  bugs in marshaling union literals between\n      Dhall and Haskell, which this release
  fixes:\n        * Dhall enums did not correctly map onto Haskell enums\n        *
  New-style union literals (i.e. `< A : T >.A x`) were not correctly\n          supported\n
  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/918\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/927\n
  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/936\n* BUG FIX: Fix
  α-normalization\n    * Version 1.22.0 introduced a new faster evaluation algorithm,
  but the new\n      algorithm introduced two α-normalization regression, which this
  release\n      fixes\n    * The primary effect of this bug was that semantic integrity
  checks would\n      fail for expressions that contain an `if`/`then`/else` expression
  in their\n      normal form\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/931\n
  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/938\n* BUG FIX: Fix
  merging of sort-level record types\n    * The language standard requires that `{
  a : Kind } ⩓ { b : Kind }` is\n      valid, which this change fixes\n    * See:
  https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/891\n* BUG FIX: `dhall freeze`
  respects the `--ascii` flag\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/934\n*
  BUG FIX: Don't autocomplete fields for record types\n    * This prevents the REPL
  from expanding `{ x : T }.<TAB>` to `{ x : T }.x`\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/937\n*
  Support `MonadFail`-related changes in GHC 8.8\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/912\n*
  Add `cross` flag to simplify cross-compilation\n    * This allows the `dhall` package
  to be built without using\n      `TemplateHaskell`\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/928\n*
  Increase lines of context for error messages \n    * Error messages now provide
  at least 20 lines of context instead of 3\n      before truncating large expressions\n
  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/916\n* Add line numbers
  to error messages\n    * The bottom of every Dhall type error includes the original
  source code,\n      which now has line numbers on the left margin\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/919\n*
  Expand lower bounds on `megaparsec`/`transformers-compat` dependencies\n    * This
  is to support `dhall` on Debian Sid\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/939\n\n1.22.0\n\n*
  Supports version 7.0.0 of the standard\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/releases/tag/v7.0.0\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE: Add support for empty alternatives\n    * The `Union` type now
  has an optional (`Maybe`) type for each alternative\n    * See the changelog for
  standard version 7.0.0 for more details\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/863\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE: Remove support for URL fragments\n    * The `URL` type no longer
  has a field for a URL fragment since the language\n      no longer supports fragments\n
  \   * See the changelog for standard version 7.0.0 for more details\n    * See:
  https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/851\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Remove
  deprecated `Path` type synonym\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/858\n*
  BUG FIX: Correctly parse identifiers beginning with `http`\n    * i.e. `httpPort`
  was supposed to be a valid identifier name and now is\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/870\n*
  BUG FIX: Fix `dhall encode` bug\n    * `dhall encode` bug was generating binary
  expressions that were valid\n      (i.e. they would decode correctly) but were non-standard
  (i.e. hashing\n      them would not match the hash you would normally get from a
  semantic\n      integrity check)\n    * Semantic integrity checks were not affected
  by this bug since they used\n      a slightly different code path that generated
  the correct binary input to\n      the hash.  Only the `dhall decode` subcommand
  was affected\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/859\n*
  BUG FIX: Fix for `Dhall.UnionType`\n    * This fixes some expressions that would
  previously fail to marshal into\n      Haskell, specifically those were the marshalling
  logic was built using\n      the `UnionType` utilities\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/857\n*
  Feature: New `--alpha` flag to α-normalize command-line output\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/855\n*
  Performance improvements\n    * The normalizer is now *much* faster\n    * See:
  https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/876\n\n1.21.0\n\n* Supports version
  6.0.0 of the language standard\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/releases/tag/v6.0.0\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE: Remove the `constructors` keyword\n    * ... as standardized in
  version 6.0.0 of the language standard\n    * The deprecation cycle is over, so
  the keyword is no longer supported\n    * For more details, see: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/wiki/Migration%3A-Deprecation-of-constructors-keyword\n
  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/829\n* BREAKING CHANGE:
  CBOR-encode only special `Double`s as half-floats\n    * ... as standardized in
  version 6.0.0 of the language standard\n    * CBOR `Double`s except `Infinity`/`-Infinity`/`NaN`/`0.0`
  are now encoded in at\n      least 32 bits\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/822\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE: Sort record and union fields when CBOR-encoding\n    * Fields and
  alternatives are now sorted when serialized\n    * This does not affect semantic
  integrity checks, which already sorted these\n      fields/alternatives before hashing
  expressions\n    * This does affect the serialization of expressions that have not
  been\n      normalized (e.g. uninterpreted expressions transmitted over the wire)\n
  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/835\n* BUG FIX: Fix
  non-exhaustive pattern match in `dhall lint`\n    * This fixes: `Irrefutable pattern
  failed for pattern Let (l' :| ls') d'`\n    * This bug would cause `dhall lint`
  to fail on some nested `let`/`in`\n      expressions\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/780\n
  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/784\n* BUG FIX: Don't
  fail if `$HOME` environment variable is unset\n    * The interpreter was incorrectly
  throwing an exception if `HOME` was unset\n    * The standard requires that implementations
  should handle the `HOME`\n      environment variable being missing\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/789\n*
  Feature: Remove version tag from semantic integrity check\n    * ... as standardized
  in version 6.0.0 of the language standard\n    * This is not a breaking change because
  this change also includes\n      backwards-compatible support for semantic integrity
  checks produced by\n      older versions of the interpreter\n* Feature: Support
  Unicode path components\n    * ... as standardized in version 6.0.0 of the language
  standard\n    * You can now use Unicode in path components if they are quoted\n
  \   * i.e. `./families/\"禺.dhall\"` is now legal\n* Feature: Add `Text/show` built-in\n
  \   * ... as standardized in version 6.0.0 of the language standard\n    * You can
  now convert a `Text` literal to its equivalent Dhall source code\n      (which is
  itself a `Text` literal)\n    * This comes in handy when using Dhall code to generate
  JSON or Dhall code\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/811\n*
  Feature: Add `--immediate-dependencies`/`--transitive-dependencies` flags for\n
  \ `dhall resolve`\n    * You can now retrieve all of your immediate or transitive
  dependencies as a\n      textual list\n    * This simplifies integration with other
  command-line tools (such as file\n      watchers)\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/795\n
  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/803\n* Feature: `dhall
  freeze` now only freezes remote imports by default\n    * `dhall freeze` used to
  freeze all imports (including local imports and\n      environment variables)\n
  \   * Now `dhall freeze` only freezes remote imports by default, which is what\n
  \     most users want\n    * You can install freeze all imports using the `--all`
  flag\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/808\n* Feature:
  `:save` and `:load` REPL state\n    * `:save` with no arguments now saves the REPL
  state to a `.dhall-repl-N`\n       file\n    * The file format is a list of `dhall
  repl` commands\n    * You can use `:load` to load the saved state back into the
  REPL\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/807\n* Feature:
  Add `:hash` command to `dhall repl`\n    * This lets you conveniently hash expressions
  within the `dhall repl`\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/806\n*
  Feature: Add `--check` flag to `dhall format`\n    * Use this to check if the input
  is already formatted\n    * Useful for continuous integration when you want to ensure
  that all code\n      under version control remains formatted\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/810\n*
  Feature: Add  `UnionInputType` builder for `InputType`s\n    * This is the union
  analog of `RecordInputType`, letting you build a\n      record explicitly instead
  of deriving the instance using GHC generics\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/775\n*
  Feature: Add `:set`/`:unset` commands to `dhall repl`\n    * You can use these commands
  to set or unset command-line options\n    * Currently only setting/unsetting `--explain`
  is supported\n* Standards-compliance fixes:\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/779\n

  REPL fixes:\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/837\n\n1.20.1\n\n*
  BUG FIX: Fix binary encoding to use correct standard version\n    * This fixes computed
  hashes to correctly match standard version 5.0.0\n    * This is not marked as a
  breaking change since it is a bug fix.  The\n      1.20.0 release will be blacklisted
  on Hackage and users should upgrade\n      from 1.19.* directly to 1.20.1\n    *
  See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/771\n\n1.20.0\n\n* Supports
  version 5.0.0 of the language standard\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/releases/tag/v5.0.0\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE TO THE LANGUAGE: Implement standardized support for multi-line\n
  \ literals\n    * This updates the multi-line support to match the standard\n    *
  This is a breaking change because empty lines within the multi-line\n      literal
  now require leading whitespace whereas previously they did not\n    * This is also
  a breaking change because now a newline is required after\n      the opening `''`
  quotes whereas previously it was not required\n    * If you use `dhall format` then
  your multi-line literals already have the\n      necessary leading whitespace\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE TO THE LANGUAGE: `constructors x = x`\n    * Now the `constructors`
  keyword behaves like an identity function, since\n      constructors can already
  be accessed as fields off the original union\n      type.\n    * This is a breaking
  change since any record of terms that contains a\n      `constructors` field will
  now be a forbidden mixed record of types and\n      terms.\n    * This is also a
  breaking change if you annotated the type of what used to\n      be a `constructors`
  record.\n    * `dhall lint` will now remove the obsolete `constructors` keyword
  for you\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/693\n    *
  See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/701\n* BREAKING CHANGE TO
  THE API: Restore `Parent` constructor for `Local` type\n    * This more closely
  matches the standard and also enables `dhall format` to\n      produce a leading
  `../` for imports instead of `./../`\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/718\n*
  BUG FIX: Fix type-checking bug for unions\n    * The first fix was that the inferred
  type was wrong for unions where\n      alternatives were types or kinds\n    * The
  second fix was that unions that mixed terms/types/kinds were not\n      properly
  rejected\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/763\n* BUG
  FIX: Change how `dhall repl` handles prior definitions\n    * This changes the REPL
  to handle previous bindings as if they were\n      defined using a large `let` expression
  instead of adding them to the\n      context\n    * This fixes some type-checking
  false negatives\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/729\n*
  Feature: Autocomplete for `dhall repl`\n    * You can now auto-complete record fields,
  union constructors, and\n      identifiers that are in scope\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/727\n*
  Feature: GHCJS support\n    * `dhall` can now be built using GHCJS, although some
  features are still\n      not supported for GHCJS, such as:\n        * Semantic
  integrity checks\n        * Custom HTTP headers\n    * Also, HTTP imports only work
  for URLs that support CORS\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/739\n*
  Feature: Add support for records of records of types\n    * You can now nest records
  of types\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/700\n* Feature:
  Add `:quit` command for `dhall repl`\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/719\n*
  Feature: Add `--json` flag for `dhall {encode,decode}`\n    * You can now produce/consume
  CBOR expressions via JSON instead of binary\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/717\n*
  Feature: Add decoding logic for `as Text`\n    * You can now preserve the `as Text`
  qualifier on imports when serializing\n      them\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/712\n*
  Prenormalize substituted expressions\n    * This is a performance improvement that
  reduces the time and memory\n      consumption when normalizing expressions\n    *
  See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/765\n\n1.19.1\n\n\n* BUG FIX:
  Fix serious `dhall lint` bug\n    * `dhall lint` would sometimes remove `let` expressions
  that were still\n      in use\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/703\n*
  BUG FIX: Fix import caching efficiency bug\n    * Some imports were being wastefully
  fetched multiple times\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/702\n*
  Feature: Generate dot graph to visualize import graph\n    * Use the `dhall resolve
  --dot` command\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/698\n
  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/713\n* Improve HTTP
  error messages\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/710\n\n1.19.0\n\n*
  Supports version 4.0.0 of the language standard\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/releases/tag/v4.0.0\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE TO THE LANGUAGE AND API: Prevent Hurkens' paradox\n    * This fixes
  a type-checking soundness bug which permitted infinite loops\n    * This is a breaking
  change because infinite loops are no longer possible\n    * This is also a breaking
  change because a record of types is now treated as\n      a kind instead of a type\n
  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/680\n* BREAKING CHANGE
  TO THE LANGUAGE AND API: `Double`s are now double-precision\n  floating point numbers\n
  \   * This restricts the range of `Double`s to IEEE 754 double-precision\n      floating
  point\n    * This also implies that you can no longer convert `Scientific` values
  to\n      `Dhall` expressions (i.e. no `Inject` instance for `Scientific`)\n    *
  See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/667\n* BREAKING CHANGE TO
  THE API: Preserve field order for record projection\n    * The API uses a new `Dhall.Set.Set`
  type instead of `Data.Set.Set`\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/670\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE TO THE API: Add support for multi-`let` expressions\n    * This
  changes the `Let` constructor to now support storing multiple\n      bindings per
  `let` expression\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/675\n*
  Access constructors as if they were fields of the union type\n    * In other words:
  `< Left : Bool | Right : Natural >.Left`\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/657\n*
  Support GHC 8.6\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/669\n*
  Add support for quoted path components\n    * i.e. `/\"foo\"/bar/\"baz qux\"` or
  `https://example.com/foo/\"bar?baz\"?qux`\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/690\n*
  Fix parsing of `//\\\\` operator\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/commit/9d0fd42d95ab69fa64da4afd8b60d69aca8e65a6\n*
  Preserve Unicode characters when formatting code\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/679\n*
  Allow identifier names to begin with `Some`\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/658\n*
  Add `subExpressions` `Traversal`\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/660\n*
  Add `normalizeWithM` for monadic normalization\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/371\n*
  Custom normalizers now take precedence over default normalization logic\n    * This
  allows one to override the implementation of built-in operators\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/684\n\n1.18.0\n\n*
  Supports version 3.0.0 of the language standard:\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/releases/tag/v3.0.0\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE TO THE LANGUAGE AND API: New `Some`/`None` constructors for\n  `Optional`
  values\n    * Example: `[ Some 1, None Natural ]`\n    * This is a breaking change
  to the language because `Some` and `None` are\n      now reserved keywords\n    *
  This is a breaking change to the API because `Some` and `None` are new\n      constructors
  for the `Expr` type\n* BREAKING CHANGE TO THE LANGUAGE AND API: Support for kind
  polymorphism\n    * This adds a new `Sort` constant above `Kind` in the hierarchy\n
  \   * i.e. `Type : Kind : Sort`\n    * This is a breaking change to the language
  because `Sort` is now a\n      reserved keyword\n    * This is a breaking change
  to the API because `Sort` is a new\n      constructor for the `Expr` type\n* BREAKING
  CHANGE TO THE API: New `Dhall.Map` module\n    * This replaces `InsOrdHashMap` in
  the API\n    * The primary motivation is to improve performance and to remove the\n
  \     dependency on `insert-ordered-containers`\n* BREAKING CHANGE TO THE API: Use

  This release corresponds to version 2.0.0 of the language standard\n* BREAKING CHANGE
  TO THE LANGUAGE AND API: Binary serialization support\n    * This is a breaking
  change to the hash for all semantic integrity checks\n    * The hash used by the
  semantic integrity check is now based on the\n      binary representation instead
  of a text representation of the\n      expression\n    * You can pin the new hashes
  by supplying the `--protocol-version 1.0`\n      option on the command line until
  you need support for newer language\n      features \n    * This also includes a
  breaking change to `ImportType` in the API\n* BREAKING CHANGE TO THE LANGUAGE: Disallow
  combining records of terms and\n  types\n    * This is mainly for consistency and
  to improve type errors that would\n      have otherwise happened further downstream\n
  \   * This should not affect the vast majority of code\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/538\n*

  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/478\n\n1.14.0\n\n* BREAKING
  CHANGE TO THE LANGUAGE: Switch grammar of `Natural` and `Integer`\n    * `Natural`
  number literals are now unsigned and `Integer` literals always\n      require a
  sign\n    * This is a **VERY** disruptive change to most Dhall code in the wild
  but\n      was unanimously agreed upon here:\n      https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/issues/138\n
  \   * See also: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/381\n* BREAKING
  CHANGE TO THE LANGUAGE: Drop support for importing directories\n    * Importing
  `dir/` used to resolve to `dir/@`, which is no longer supported\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/384\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE TO THE LANGUAGE: Change to the grammar for imports\n    * File path
  components can no longer contain `#` or `?` characters\n    * URL imports must now
  contain at least one path component\n    * URL path components must match the grammar
  for file path components\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/390\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE TO THE API: Rename `Path{,Mode,Hashed,Type}` to\n  `Import{,Mode,Hashed,Type}`\n
  \   * In practice this change is not breaking for the most common use cases\n      since
  this also provides a `Path` type synonym for backwards compatibility\n    * See:
  https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/376\n* BUG FIX: Fix α-equivalence
  bug when type-checking `merge`\n    * `merge` expressions would sometimes reject
  valid code due to a\n       type-checking bug\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/394\n*
  Improve import caching\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/388\n

  Increase upper bound on `ansi-terminal` and `megaparsec`\n\n1.13.0\n\n* BUG FIX:
  Fix semantic integrity hashing support\n    * Both parsing and pretty-printing semantic
  hashes were broken since version\n      1.11.0\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/345\n*
  BUG FIX: Allow leading whitespace in interpolated expresssions\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/369\n*
  BUG FIX: Fix `deriving (Interpret)` for sum types\n    * The types of alternatives
  were not correctly included in the corresponding\n      Dhall type\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/348\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE TO LANGUAGE: Records cannot store both types and terms\n    * Records
  can also not store type-level functions (like `List`)\n        * Records might be
  allowed to store type-level functions again in the\n          future\n    * This
  fixes a potential soundness bug\n    * The primarily practical consequence of this
  change is that if you are\n      hosting a \"package\" then you will need to split
  terms and types from your\n      package into different records for your users to
  import\n    * This also implies removing the `./Monoid` type-level function from
  the\n      `./Prelude/package.dhall` record\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/335\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE TO THE API: Replace `trifecta` with `megaparsec`\n    * This change
  the API to use the `Parser` type from `megaparsec`\n    * This also slightly changes
  the type of `exprFromText`\n    * If you program using the type classes provided
  by the `parsers` library\n      then this is not a breaking change as that interface
  is preserved\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/268\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE TO THE API: New `⩓` operator for merging record types\n    * Example:
  `{ foo : Text } ⩓ { bar : Bool } = { foo : Text, bar : Bool }`\n    * This is breaking
  because it adds a new constructor to the `Expr` type\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/342\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE TO THE API: New support for projecting a subset of fields\n    *
  Example: `{ x = 1, y = 2, z = 3 }.{ x, y } = { x = 1, y = 2 }`\n    * This is breaking
  because it adds a new constructor to the `Expr` type\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/350\n*
  API+UX feature: New support for pretty-printing diffs of Dhall expressions\n    *
  Error messages also use this feature to simplify large type mismatches\n    * There
  is also a new `Dhall.Diff` module\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/336\n*
  Add `version`, `resolve`, `type`, and `normalize` sub-commands to interpreter\n
  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/352\n* Support GHC 7.10.3\n
  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/340\n* `:type` command
  in `dhall-repl` now only displays the type\n    * Before it would also display the
  original expression\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/344\n*
  Trim dependency tree\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/351\n

  Additional changes to support GHC 8.4\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/331\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE TO API: Replace dependency on `text-format` with `formatting`\n
  \   * This replace the `Data.Text.Buildable.Buildable` instances with\n      `Formatting.Buildable.Buildable`
  instances, which is why this is a\n       breaking change\n    * `text-format` is
  no longer maintained and blocking GHC 8.4 support\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/330\n\n1.11.1\n\n*
  Support GHC 8.4\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/321\n*
  Fix α-normalization bug\n    * Note that this is not a type-checking bug.  This
  only affects users who\n      were directly using the `alphaNormalize` function
  from the Haskell API\n      because `let` expressions were not correctly α-normalized\n
  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/319\n* Slight tweak
  to syntax highlighting\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/324\n*
  Increase upper bound on `ansi-terminal` and `exceptions`\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/322\n
  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/325\n\n1.11.0\n\n* BREAKING
  CHANGE TO THE API: Fix `{Natural,Optional,List}/build` semantics to\n  match standard\n
  \   * This is a breaking change because the `OptionalLit` and `ListLit`\n      constructors
  changed their representations to efficiently support the\n      standard semantics\n
  \   * `ListLit` now stores a `Data.Sequence.Seq` instead of a\n      `Data.Vector.Vector`\n
  \   * `OptionalLit` now stores a `Maybe` instead of a `Data.Vector.Vector`\n    *
  See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/300\n* BREAKING CHANGE TO
  THE COMMAND LINE: `dhall` executable always formats output\n    * Previously you
  had to opt into formatting using `--pretty`\n    * Now formatting is obligatory
  and the `--pretty` flag is gone\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/303\n*
  Feature: New `:save` command for `dhall-repl`\n    * Now you can save an expression
  to a file: `./yourFile = someExpression`\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/309\n*
  Improvement: Add new simplifications to match standard\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/312\n
  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/316\n* Improvement:
  Fix equivalence check to match standard\n    * Practically this means that more
  corner cases of the language correctly\n      type-check than before\n* Improvement:
  New `--plain` flag to disable syntax highlighting\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/310\n*
  Improvement: Prelude now provides an umbrella `package.dhall` import\n    * This
  is primarily for convenience\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/298\n*
  Improvement: Context is now normalized\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/302\n*
  Replace `cryptohash` dependency with `cryptonite`\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/commit/5d2012927a062ec8bdf2bbaba77150344f38db77\n*

  \   * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/260\n* Feature: BREAKING
  CHANGE TO THE API: `dhall-format` preserves field order\n    * This changes the
  syntax tree to use an `InsOrdHashMap` instead of a `Map`\n* BREAKING CHANGE TO THE
  API: Use Haskell's `Scientific` type\n    * This is fixes the interpreter to correct
  handle really large/small numbers\n    * This also allows marshaling into Haskell's
  `Scientific` type\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/256\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE TO THE API: Remove `system-filepath`/`system-fileio` dependencies\n

  custom context from triggering an infinite loop\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/259\n\n1.9.1\n\n*
  `dhall-format` now emits single-quoted strings for multi-line strings\n    * See:

  Feature: BREAKING CHANGE TO LANGUAGE AND API: Add `constructors` keyword\n    *
  This new keyword generates constructors from a union type\n        * See the updated
  Haskell tutorial for more details\n    * This means that `constructors` is now a
  reserved keyword\n    * This adds a new `Constructors` constructor to the `Expr`
  type\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/199\n* Feature:
  BREAKING CHANGE TO THE API: `dhall-format` preserves interpolation\n    * This changes

  Security: Fix potential type-checking bug\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/198\n*
  Fix: BREAKING CHANGE TO API: Improve localization of error messages\n    * This
  required fixing the type of `normalize`/`shift`/`subst` to preserve\n      the first
  type parameter of `Expr` (i.e. they no longer delete `Note`\n      constructors)\n
  \   * A new `denote` function was added for the explicit purpose of deleting\n      `Note`
  constructors\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/218\n*
  Expose `MissingEnvironmentVariable` exception type\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/196\n*
  Add `genericAuto`\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/195\n*
  Add `inputWith`\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/222\n*
  Add`loadWithContext`\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/215\n*
  Add `pair`/`unit`/`string`/`list`\n    * See: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/227\n\n1.8.2\n\n*
  Add `typeWithA` for type-checking custom `Embed`ded values\n* Fix `dhall{,-*}` executables
  to ignore ambient locale and use UTF8\n* Increase upper bound on `tasty` dependency\n\n1.8.1\n\n*
  `dhall` executable can now format output using `--pretty`\n* Improved Unicode suppport
  on Windows\n\n1.8.0\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE TO LANGUAGE: Add support for import integrity
  checks\n    * In practice, the likelihood of this breaking code in the wild is\n
  \     astronomically low\n    * This would only break code of the form `sha256:aaa...aaa`
  (i.e. a\n      variabled named `sha256` with a type annotation for a type with a
  name\n      64 characters long drawn from the first 6 characters of the alphabet)\n*
  BUG FIX: Fix parsing of single quotes in single-quoted strings\n* BUG FIX: Fix superfluous
  parentheses introduced by `dhall-format`\n* New `dhall-hash` executable\n    * This
  goes hand-in-hand with the added support for integrity checks since\n      the executable
  lets you compute the current hash of an import\n\n1.7.0\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE TO
  LANGUAGE: Update parser to match standardized grammar\n    * Trailing commas and
  bars no longer supported for union and record literals\n    * Paths no longer permit
  commas\n    * URL grammar is now RFC-compliant\n    * Environment variables can
  now be quoted to support full range of\n      POSIX-compliant names\n    * Text
  literals support full set of JSON escape sequences (such as `\\u2192`)\n* BREAKING
  CHANGE TO LANGUAGE: Single quoted strings strip leading newlines\n* BUG FIX: Fixed
  type-checking infinite loops due to non-type-checked variables\n  in context\n*
  BUG FIX: Fixed type-checking bug due to missing context when type-checking\n  certain
  expressions\n* BUG FIX: Fixed type-checking bug due to off-by-one errors in name
  shadowing\n  logic\n* New `dhall-format` executable to automatically format code\n*
  Performance optimizations to `Natural/fold` and `List/fold`\n* Improved parsing
  performance (over 3x faster)\n* Union literals can now specify the set value anywhere
  in the literal\n    * i.e. `< A : Integer | B = False | C : Text >`\n* New `Inject`
  instance for `()`\n* Several tutorial fixes and improvements\n\n1.6.0\n\n* BREAKING
  CHANGE TO THE API: Drop support for GHC 7.*\n* BREAKING CHANGE TO THE API: Add support
  for customizing Dhall import\n    * This is a breaking change because this changes
  the type of `loadWith`\n* BREAKING CHANGE TO THE API: Add field to `UnboundVariable`
  error containing\n* BUG FIX: Fix parsing single quotes in string literals\n  the
  name of the unbound variable\n* Add `List/concatMap` to the Prelude\n* You can now
  derive `Inject` and `Interpret` for types with unlabeled fields\n* Add new instances
  for `Interpret`:\n    * `[]`\n    * `(,)`\n* Add new instance for `Inject`\n    *
  `[]`, `Data.Set.Set`, `Data.Sequence.Seq`\n    * `(,)`\n    * `Int`, `Word8`, `Word16`,
  `Word32`, `Word64`\n* Add `Eq` instance for `Src`\n\n1.5.1\n\n* Increase upper bound
  on `vector` and `optparse-generic`\n\n1.5.0\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Add list concatenation
  operator: `(#)`\n    * This is a breaking change because it adds a new constructor
  to the `Expr`\n      type which breaks exhaustive pattern matches\n* BREAKING CHANGE:
  Add `Interpret` support for lazy `Text`\n    * This is a breaking change because
  it renames `text` to `strictText`\n* Add `Interpret` instance for decoding (a limited
  subset of) Dhall functions\n* Dhall no longer requires Template Haskell to compile\n
  \   * This helps with cross-compilation\n* Add `rawInput` utility for decoding a
  Haskell value from the `Expr` type\n* Add `loadWith`/`normalizeWith` utilities for
  normalizing/importing modules\n  with a custom context\n* Export `Type` constructor\n\n1.4.2\n\n*
  Fix missing `Prelude` files in package archive uploaded to Hackage\n\n1.4.1\n\n*
  Fix missing `tests/Tutorial.hs` module in package archive uploaded to Hackage\n\n1.4.0\n\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE TO THE LANGUAGE AND API: You can now supply custom headers for\n
  \ URL imports with the new `using` keyword\n    * This is a breaking change to the
  language because this adds a new reserved\n      `using` keyword\n    * This is
  a breaking change to the API because this adds a new field to the\n      `URL` constructor
  to store optional custom headers\n* BUG FIX: `:` is no longer a disallowed path
  character\n    * This was breaking URL imports with a port\n* BUG FIX: If you import
  a home-anchored path (i.e. `~/foo`) and that imports a\n  relative path (like `./bar`),
  then the canonical path of the relative import\n  should be home-anchored (i.e.
  `~/bar`).  However, there was a bug that made\n  lose the home anchor (i.e. `./foo/bar`),
  which this release fixes\n  likely fail due to no longer being home-anchored (i.e.
  `./foob\n* Add support for string interpolation\n* `merge` no longer requires a
  type annotation if you are merging at least one\n  alternative\n* Expanded Prelude\n
  \   * `./Prelude/Optional/all`\n    * `./Prelude/Optional/any`\n    * `./Prelude/Optional/filter`\n
  \   * `./Prelude/Optional/length`\n    * `./Prelude/Optional/null`\n    * `./Prelude/Text/concatMap`\n
  \   * `./Prelude/Text/concatMapSep`\n    * `./Prelude/Text/concatSep`\n* Rearrange
  detailed error messages to put summary information at the bottom of\n  the message\n\n1.3.0\n\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE TO THE API: Add support for new primitives, specifically:\n    *
  `(//)` - Right-biased and shallow record merge\n    * `Optional/build` (now a built-in
  in order to support build/fold fusion)\n    * `Natural/show`\n    * `Integer/show`\n
  \   * `Double/show`\n    * `Natural/toInteger`\n    * These all add new constructors
  to the `Expr` type, which would break\n      exhaustive pattern matches\n* BREAKING
  CHANGE TO THE LANGUAGE: Imported paths and URLs no longer support\n  the characters:
  \"()[]{}<>:\"\n    * This reduces the number of cases where you have to add a space
  after\n      imports\n    * Note that this does not exclude the `:` in the URL scheme
  (i.e. `http://`)\n* Increase connection timeout for imports\n* Variable names now
  allow the `-` character for all but the first character\n* You can now escape identifiers
  with backticks\n    * This lets you name identifiers so that they don't conflict
  with reserved\n      key words\n    * This is most useful when converting Dhall
  to other file formats (like\n      JSON) where you might need to emit a field that
  conflicts with one of\n      Dhall's reserved keywords\n* New `--version` flag for
  the `dhall` executable\n\n1.2.0\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Add support for customizing
  derived `Interpret` instances\n    * This is a breaking change to the Dhall library
  API since this changes the\n      signature of the `Interpret` class by replacing
  the `auto` method with a\n      more general `autoWith` method.  This `autoWith`
  now takes an\n      `InterpretOptions` argument that lets you customize derived
  field and\n      constuctor names\n    * In practice user programs that use the
  common path will be unaffected by\n      this change\n    * This is not a breaking
  change to the Dhall language\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Type annotations now bind more
  tightly than lambda\n  abstraction\n    * This is a breaking change to the Dhall
  language.  An expression like this:\n\n      ```\n      λ(x : A) → y : B\n      ```\n\n
  \     ... used to parenthesized implicitly as:\n\n      ```\n      (λ(x : A) → y)
  : T\n      ```\n\n      ... but is now parenthesized implicitly as:\n\n      ```\n
  \     λ(x : A) → (y : T)\n      ```\n\n      This is now consistent with Haskell's
  precedence and also consistent with\n      the precedence of `List` and `Optional`
  type annotations\n\n    * This change affects programs with an expression like this:\n\n
  \     ```\n      -- Assuming that `y : B`\n      λ(x : A) → y : A → B\n      ```\n\n
  \     The above program would type-check before this change but not type-check\n
  \     after this change.  You would you need to fix the above program by either\n
  \     changing the type signature to annotate just the type of `y` like this:\n\n
  \     ```\n      λ(x : A) → y : B\n      ```\n\n      ... or by adding explicit
  parentheses like this:\n\n      ```\n      (λ(x : A) → y) : A → B\n      ```\n\n
  \   * This is not a breaking change to the Dhall library API\n* BREAKING CHANGE:
  Add support for importing a path's contents as raw `Text` by\n  adding `as Text`
  after the import\n    * This is a breaking change to the Dhall language\n    * This
  is technically a breaking change, but is extremely unlikely to affect\n      you
  program.  This only changes the behavior of old programs that had an\n      expression
  of the form:\n\n      ```\n      /some/imported/function as Text\n      ```\n\n
  \     ... where `/some/imported/function` is an imported function being applied\n
  \     to two arguments, the first of which is a bound variable named `as` and\n
  \     the second of which is the type `Text`\n    * This is not a breaking change
  to the Dhall library API\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Add support for importing environment
  variables using\n  `env:VAR` syntax\n    * This is a breaking change to the Dhall
  library API since it adds a new\n      `Path` constructor\n    * This also technically
  a breaking change to the Dhall language but\n      extremely unlikely to affect
  your program.  This only changes the behavior\n      of old programs that had an
  expression of the form:\n\n      ```\n      env:VAR\n      ```\n\n      ... where
  `env` was the name of a bound variable and `:VAR` was a type\n      annotation without
  spaces around the type annotation operator\n\n      After this change the program
  would be interpreted as an import of the\n      contents for the environment variable
  named `VAR`\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Support importing paths relative to home directory
  using\n  `~/some/path` syntax\n    * This is a breaking change to the Dhall library
  API since it adds a new\n      field to the `File` constructor indicating whether
  or not the imported\n      path is relative to the home directory\n    * This is
  not a breaking change to the Dhall language and the new syntax\n      does not override
  any old syntax\n* Permit trailing commas and bars in record/union syntax\n* Improve
  location information for parsing errors\n\n1.1.0\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Non-empty
  lists no longer require a type annotation\n    * This is a breaking change to the
  Haskell library, not the Dhall language\n    * This change does not break existing
  Dhall programs\n    * The `Expr` type was modified in a non-backwards-compatible
  way\n* Add new `exprA` parser\n* Add new `InvalidType` exception if `input` fails
  on an invalid `Type`\n* Improve documentation and tutorial\n\n1.0.2\n\n* Add support
  for Nix-style \"double single-quote\" multi-line string literals\n* Add `isNormalized`\n*
  Improve documentation and tutorial\n* Build against wider range of `http-client`
  versions\n\n1.0.1\n\n* Initial release\n\n1.0.0\n\n* Accidental premature upload
  to Hackage.  This release was blacklisted\n"

  Dhall is an explicitly typed configuration language that is not Turing
  complete.  Despite being Turing incomplete, Dhall is a real programming
  language with a type-checker and evaluator.

  Use this library to parse, type-check, evaluate, and pretty-print the Dhall
  configuration language.  This package also includes an executable which
  type-checks a Dhall file and reduces the file to a fully evaluated normal
  form.

  Read "Dhall.Tutorial" to learn how to use this library
