synopsis: A configuration language guaranteed to terminate
changelog: ! "1.8.1\n\n* \n\n1.8.0\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE TO LANGUAGE: Add support for
  import integrity checks\n    * In practice, the likelihood of this breaking code
  in the wild is\n      astronomically low\n    * This would only break code of the
  form `sha256:aaa...aaa` (i.e. a\n      variabled named `sha256` with a type annotation
  for a type with a name\n      64 characters long drawn from the first 6 characters
  of the alphabet)\n* BUG FIX: Fix parsing of single quotes in single-quoted strings\n*
  BUG FIX: Fix superfluous parentheses introduced by `dhall-format`\n* New `dhall-hash`
  executable\n    * This goes hand-in-hand with the added support for integrity checks
  since\n      the executable lets you compute the current hash of an import\n\n1.7.0\n\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE TO LANGUAGE: Update parser to match standardized grammar\n    *
  Trailing commas and bars no longer supported for union and record literals\n    *
  Paths no longer permit commas\n    * URL grammar is now RFC-compliant\n    * Environment
  variables can now be quoted to support full range of\n      POSIX-compliant names\n
  \   * Text literals support full set of JSON escape sequences (such as `\\u2192`)\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE TO LANGUAGE: Single quoted strings strip leading newlines\n* BUG
  FIX: Fixed type-checking infinite loops due to non-type-checked variables\n  in
  context\n* BUG FIX: Fixed type-checking bug due to missing context when type-checking\n
  \ certain expressions\n* BUG FIX: Fixed type-checking bug due to off-by-one errors
  in name shadowing\n  logic\n* New `dhall-format` executable to automatically format
  code\n* Performance optimizations to `Natural/fold` and `List/fold`\n* Improved
  parsing performance (over 3x faster)\n* Union literals can now specify the set value
  anywhere in the literal\n    * i.e. `< A : Integer | B = False | C : Text >`\n*
  New `Inject` instance for `()`\n* Several tutorial fixes and improvements\n\n1.6.0\n\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE TO THE API: Drop support for GHC 7.*\n* BREAKING CHANGE TO THE API:
  Add support for customizing Dhall import\n    * This is a breaking change because
  this changes the type of `loadWith`\n* BREAKING CHANGE TO THE API: Add field to
  `UnboundVariable` error containing\n* BUG FIX: Fix parsing single quotes in string
  literals\n  the name of the unbound variable\n* Add `List/concatMap` to the Prelude\n*
  You can now derive `Inject` and `Interpret` for types with unlabeled fields\n* Add
  new instances for `Interpret`:\n    * `[]`\n    * `(,)`\n* Add new instance for
  `Inject`\n    * `[]`, `Data.Set.Set`, `Data.Sequence.Seq`\n    * `(,)`\n    * `Int`,
  `Word8`, `Word16`, `Word32`, `Word64`\n* Add `Eq` instance for `Src`\n\n1.5.1\n\n*
  Increase upper bound on `vector` and `optparse-generic`\n\n1.5.0\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE:
  Add list concatenation operator: `(#)`\n    * This is a breaking change because
  it adds a new constructor to the `Expr`\n      type which breaks exhaustive pattern
  matches\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Add `Interpret` support for lazy `Text`\n    * This
  is a breaking change because it renames `text` to `strictText`\n* Add `Interpret`
  instance for decoding (a limited subset of) Dhall functions\n* Dhall no longer requires
  Template Haskell to compile\n    * This helps with cross-compilation\n* Add `rawInput`
  utility for decoding a Haskell value from the `Expr` type\n* Add `loadWith`/`normalizeWith`
  utilities for normalizing/importing modules\n  with a custom context\n* Export `Type`
  constructor\n\n1.4.2\n\n* Fix missing `Prelude` files in package archive uploaded
  to Hackage\n\n1.4.1\n\n* Fix missing `tests/Tutorial.hs` module in package archive
  uploaded to Hackage\n\n1.4.0\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE TO THE LANGUAGE AND API: You can
  now supply custom headers for\n  URL imports with the new `using` keyword\n    *
  This is a breaking change to the language because this adds a new reserved\n      `using`
  keyword\n    * This is a breaking change to the API because this adds a new field
  to the\n      `URL` constructor to store optional custom headers\n* BUG FIX: `:`
  is no longer a disallowed path character\n    * This was breaking URL imports with
  a port\n* BUG FIX: If you import a home-anchored path (i.e. `~/foo`) and that imports
  a\n  relative path (like `./bar`), then the canonical path of the relative import\n
  \ should be home-anchored (i.e. `~/bar`).  However, there was a bug that made\n
  \ lose the home anchor (i.e. `./foo/bar`), which this release fixes\n  likely fail
  due to no longer being home-anchored (i.e. `./foob\n* Add support for string interpolation\n*
  `merge` no longer requires a type annotation if you are merging at least one\n  alternative\n*
  Expanded Prelude\n    * `./Prelude/Optional/all`\n    * `./Prelude/Optional/any`\n
  \   * `./Prelude/Optional/filter`\n    * `./Prelude/Optional/length`\n    * `./Prelude/Optional/null`\n
  \   * `./Prelude/Text/concatMap`\n    * `./Prelude/Text/concatMapSep`\n    * `./Prelude/Text/concatSep`\n*
  Rearrange detailed error messages to put summary information at the bottom of\n
  \ the message\n\n1.3.0\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE TO THE API: Add support for new primitives,
  specifically:\n    * `(//)` - Right-biased and shallow record merge\n    * `Optional/build`
  (now a built-in in order to support build/fold fusion)\n    * `Natural/show`\n    *
  `Integer/show`\n    * `Double/show`\n    * `Natural/toInteger`\n    * These all
  add new constructors to the `Expr` type, which would break\n      exhaustive pattern
  matches\n* BREAKING CHANGE TO THE LANGUAGE: Imported paths and URLs no longer support\n
  \ the characters: \"()[]{}<>:\"\n    * This reduces the number of cases where you
  have to add a space after\n      imports\n    * Note that this does not exclude
  the `:` in the URL scheme (i.e. `http://`)\n* Increase connection timeout for imports\n*
  Variable names now allow the `-` character for all but the first character\n* You
  can now escape identifiers with backticks\n    * This lets you name identifiers
  so that they don't conflict with reserved\n      key words\n    * This is most useful
  when converting Dhall to other file formats (like\n      JSON) where you might need
  to emit a field that conflicts with one of\n      Dhall's reserved keywords\n* New
  `--version` flag for the `dhall` executable\n\n1.2.0\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Add support
  for customizing derived `Interpret` instances\n    * This is a breaking change to
  the Dhall library API since this changes the\n      signature of the `Interpret`
  class by replacing the `auto` method with a\n      more general `autoWith` method.
  \ This `autoWith` now takes an\n      `InterpretOptions` argument that lets you
  customize derived field and\n      constuctor names\n    * In practice user programs
  that use the common path will be unaffected by\n      this change\n    * This is
  not a breaking change to the Dhall language\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Type annotations
  now bind more tightly than lambda\n  abstraction\n    * This is a breaking change
  to the Dhall language.  An expression like this:\n\n      ```\n      λ(x : A) →
  y : B\n      ```\n\n      ... used to parenthesized implicitly as:\n\n      ```\n
  \     (λ(x : A) → y) : T\n      ```\n\n      ... but is now parenthesized implicitly
  as:\n\n      ```\n      λ(x : A) → (y : T)\n      ```\n\n      This is now consistent
  with Haskell's precedence and also consistent with\n      the precedence of `List`
  and `Optional` type annotations\n\n    * This change affects programs with an expression
  like this:\n\n      ```\n      -- Assuming that `y : B`\n      λ(x : A) → y : A
  → B\n      ```\n\n      The above program would type-check before this change but
  not type-check\n      after this change.  You would you need to fix the above program
  by either\n      changing the type signature to annotate just the type of `y` like
  this:\n\n      ```\n      λ(x : A) → y : B\n      ```\n\n      ... or by adding
  explicit parentheses like this:\n\n      ```\n      (λ(x : A) → y) : A → B\n      ```\n\n
  \   * This is not a breaking change to the Dhall library API\n* BREAKING CHANGE:
  Add support for importing a path's contents as raw `Text` by\n  adding `as Text`
  after the import\n    * This is a breaking change to the Dhall language\n    * This
  is technically a breaking change, but is extremely unlikely to affect\n      you
  program.  This only changes the behavior of old programs that had an\n      expression
  of the form:\n\n      ```\n      /some/imported/function as Text\n      ```\n\n
  \     ... where `/some/imported/function` is an imported function being applied\n
  \     to two arguments, the first of which is a bound variable named `as` and\n
  \     the second of which is the type `Text`\n    * This is not a breaking change
  to the Dhall library API\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Add support for importing environment
  variables using\n  `env:VAR` syntax\n    * This is a breaking change to the Dhall
  library API since it adds a new\n      `Path` constructor\n    * This also technically
  a breaking change to the Dhall language but\n      extremely unlikely to affect
  your program.  This only changes the behavior\n      of old programs that had an
  expression of the form:\n\n      ```\n      env:VAR\n      ```\n\n      ... where
  `env` was the name of a bound variable and `:VAR` was a type\n      annotation without
  spaces around the type annotation operator\n\n      After this change the program
  would be interpreted as an import of the\n      contents for the environment variable
  named `VAR`\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Support importing paths relative to home directory
  using\n  `~/some/path` syntax\n    * This is a breaking change to the Dhall library
  API since it adds a new\n      field to the `File` constructor indicating whether
  or not the imported\n      path is relative to the home directory\n    * This is
  not a breaking change to the Dhall language and the new syntax\n      does not override
  any old syntax\n* Permit trailing commas and bars in record/union syntax\n* Improve
  location information for parsing errors\n\n1.1.0\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Non-empty
  lists no longer require a type annotation\n    * This is a breaking change to the
  Haskell library, not the Dhall language\n    * This change does not break existing
  Dhall programs\n    * The `Expr` type was modified in a non-backwards-compatible
  way\n* Add new `exprA` parser\n* Add new `InvalidType` exception if `input` fails
  on an invalid `Type`\n* Improve documentation and tutorial\n\n1.0.2\n\n* Add support
  for Nix-style \"double single-quote\" multi-line string literals\n* Add `isNormalized`\n*
  Improve documentation and tutorial\n* Build against wider range of `http-client`
  versions\n\n1.0.1\n\n* Initial release\n\n1.0.0\n\n* Accidental premature upload
  to Hackage.  This release was blacklisted\n"

description: ! 'Dhall is an explicitly typed configuration language that is not Turing

  complete.  Despite being Turing incomplete, Dhall is a real programming

  language with a type-checker and evaluator.


  Use this library to parse, type-check, evaluate, and pretty-print the Dhall

  configuration language.  This package also includes an executable which

  type-checks a Dhall file and reduces the file to a fully evaluated normal

  form.
