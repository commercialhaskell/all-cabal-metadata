description: |-
  * The [knowledge base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning) ( kb )
    aims to be a data structure able to:

      * represent /multiple/ facts about the source code repo
      * from /various/ programming languages
      * each fact can be translated to a [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) fact
      * facts can be combined to create [predicates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_%28logic%29)
      * predictaes can be combined to formulate /security queries/

  * [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) facts describe relations between:

      * code locations
      * const strings
      * const integers

  * [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) facts can be /combined/:

      * create /expressive/ queries from /simple/ facts
      * [conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction)
      * [disjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction)
      * [negation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation)

  * [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) queries are /easy/ to write:

      * you /don't/ have to be a Prolog expert
      * copy-paste the basic facts to /any/ [LLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model)
      * explain in plain English your query's purpose
      * et voil√† !
