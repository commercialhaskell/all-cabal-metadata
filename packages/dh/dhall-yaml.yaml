changelog: |
  1.2.7

  * Build against `dhall-1.39.0`

  1.2.6

  * [Allow bytestring-0.11](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/2144)

  1.2.5

  * Build against `dhall-1.38.0`, `tasty-1.4`, and `tasty-silver-3.2`

  1.2.4

  * Build against `dhall-1.37.0`

  1.2.3

  * [Fix command-line completions for files](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/2034)

  1.2.2

  * [The `--documents` flag now wraps non-`List`s in a document](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1977)

  1.2.1

  * [Format documents with leading `---`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1865)
      * Now if you use the `--documents` flag the first document will also
        include a leading `---`

  1.2.0

  * BREAKING CHANGE: [Add `--generated-comment` flag for `dhall-to-yaml{-ng}`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1840)
      * You can now optionally add a comment header to the YAML output
        indicating that the file is generated and should not be hand-edited
      * This is a breaking change because this adds a new `noEdit` field to the
        options type
      * In practice this breakage won't affect most users
  * [Produce output compatible with YAML 1.1](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1788)
      * Special strings like `on` are now quoted in order to avoid being
        misinterpreted as boolean values by YAML 1.1 implementations
  * [Show JSON/YAML path on error reporting](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1799)
      * Error messages will now include the path to the error in the diagnostic
        output

  1.1.0

  * BREAKING CHANGE: [Add `yaml-to-dhall` support for inferring the schema](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1773)
      * You no longer need to provide the command with an explicit schema.  The
        command will infer a reasonably close schema from the provided YAML
      * This is a breaking change because the `schema` field of the `Options` type
        now has type `Maybe Text` instead of `Text`
  * [Add `yaml-to-dhall type` subcommand](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1776)
      * You can use this subcommand to print the inferred schema for a YAML value,
        so that you can edit the schema and use it for subsequent invocations.
  * [Add `yaml-to-dhall` support for using `toMap`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/pull/1745)
      * Now if you specify a `Map` as the schema, the generated Dhall code will
        use `toMap` to improve the appearance

  1.0.3

  * [yaml: Single-quote date/bool string fields](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/commits/master/dhall-json)

  1.0.2

  * Build against `dhall-1.30.0`

  1.0.1

  * Build against `dhall-1.29.0`

  1.0.0

  * Initial release

  # `dhall-yaml`

  For installation or development instructions, see:

  * [`dhall-haskell` - `README`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/blob/master/README.md)

  Full documentation here:

  * [`dhall-yaml` instructions](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dhall-yaml/docs/Dhall-Yaml.html)

  ## Introduction

  This `dhall-yaml` package provides a Dhall to YAML compiler, `dhall-to-yaml-ng`,
  and a tool for deriving Dhall from YAML code: `yaml-to-dhall`.

  Note that the `dhall-json` package also provides a `dhall-to-yaml` executable.
  Currently, the behavior of the `dhall-to-yaml` and `dhall-to-yaml-ng`
  executables should not differ much, but eventually the `dhall-to-yaml-ng`
  executable should be able to support greater functionality due to using the
  `HsYAML` package as an intermediate step in the transformation process.

  Tutorials for the analogous JSON tools are available in the `dhall-json`
  package:

  * [`dhall-to-json`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dhall-json/docs/Dhall-JSON.html)

  * [`json-to-dhall`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dhall-json/docs/Dhall-JSONToDhall.html)

  ## Example

  ```bash
  $ dhall-to-yaml-ng <<< "{ foo = [1, 2, 3], bar = { baz = True } }" > example.yaml
  $ cat example.yaml
  bar:
    baz: true
  foo:
  - 1
  - 2
  - 3
  $ yaml-to-dhall '{ foo : List Natural, bar : { baz : Bool } }' < example.yaml
  { bar = { baz = True }, foo = [ 1, 2, 3 ] }
  ```
