description: |-
  The [intermediate language \/ intermediate representation \/ bitcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation#Intermediate_language)
  (IL \/ IR \/ bitcode) is a data structure able to represent code originating from /multiple/
  programming languages. Its main purpose is to enable an efficient and uniform /static code analysis/,
  as part of the [dhscanner](https://github.com/OrenGitHub/dhscanner) framework
  for [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) container security checks.
  As part of that framework, it targets mostly languages used for /cloud native applications/:
  __Python__, __Ruby__, __Php__, __Javascript__, __Typescript__, __Java__, __C#__ and __Golang__.
  Typically, a collection of files are first parsed using relevant
  [parsers](https://github.com/OrenGitHub/dhscanner.1.parsers), then,
  the resulting collection of abstract syntax trees is sent to code generation,
  where it is translated into a collection of /callables/.
  A callable is a sequence of commands corresponding to either a function, a method
  or (in languages like python) a script. The design of commands was done with simplicity
  in mind. The commands resemble an abstract RISC-style assembley, motivated by keeping
  later-phases analyses as simple as possible.
