  Inject attoparsec parser with backtracking into non-backtracking scanner

  [![Haskell CI](https://github.com/Yuras/scanner-attoparsec/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Yuras/scanner-attoparsec/actions/workflows/build.yml)

  Backtracking kills performance, so scanner package doesn't support it.
  But sometimes you just need it. E.g. you have a mostly non-backtracking
  parser, but a small bit of its grammar is too complex to transform it
  to non-backtracking form. In that case you can inject a backtracking
  attoparsec parser into otherwise non-backtracking scanner.
