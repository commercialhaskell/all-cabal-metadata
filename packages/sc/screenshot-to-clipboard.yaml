  This program provides a simple way to take a screenshot and copy it to your
  system clipboard.

  When you run `screenshot-to-clipboard`, it internally runs the
  [`import`](https://imagemagick.org/script/import.php) program from
  [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org) to take a screenshot, and then uses
  [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/) to copy that screenshot to your system clipboard.

  ## Installation

  The recommended installation procedure is to use Nix.  With Nix installed, just do:

  ```console
  $ git clone git@github.com:cdepillabout/screenshot-to-clipboard
  $ cd screenshot-to-clipboard/
  $ nix-build
  ```

  You can run this program with the output `result/bin/screenshot-to-clipboard` program.

  `screenshot-to-clipboard` is also available in Nixpkgs, starting with
  NixOS-22.11 as `haskellPackages.screenshot-to-clipboard`.

  It is also possible to build with `cabal` (or `stack`), but you are responsible for
  installing necessary system libraries.  You'll likely need both `imagemagick`,
  and the development packages for GTK.

  ## Usage

  If you run `screenshot-to-clipboard`, it will turn your cursor into a
  cross-hair.  Click and drag to select a portion of the screen to take a
  screenshot.  This screenshot will be copied to your system clipboard.  You can
  paste it into another application.

  `screenshot-to-clipboard` will continue running until you've copied _something
  else_ into your system clipboard.  See the long comment in
  [`src/ScreenshotToClipboard.hs`](./src/ScreenshotToClipboard.hs) for why this
  is necessary.
