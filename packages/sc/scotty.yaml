changelog: |
  ## 0.11.5 [2019.09.07]
  * Allow building the test suite with `hspec-wai-0.10`.

  ## 0.11.4 [2019.05.02]
  * Allow building with `base-4.13` (GHC 8.8).

  ## 0.11.3 [2019.01.08]
  * Drop the test suite's dependency on `hpc-coveralls`, which is unmaintained
    and does not build with GHC 8.4 or later.

  ## 0.11.2 [2018.07.02]
  * Migrate from `Network` to `Network.Socket` to avoid deprecation warnings.

  ## 0.11.1 [2018.04.07]
  * Add `MonadThrow` and `MonadCatch` instances for `ActionT` [abhinav]
  * Fix `matchAny` so that all methods are matched, not just standard ones
    [taphu]

  ## 0.11.0
  * IO exceptions are no longer automatically turned into ScottyErrors by
    `liftIO`. Use `liftAndCatchIO` to get that behavior.
  * New `finish` function.
  * Text values are now leniently decoded from ByteStrings.
  * Added `MonadFail` instance for `ScottyT`
  * Lots of bound bumps on dependencies.

  ## 0.10.2
  * Removed debug statement from routes

  ## 0.10.1
  * `Parsable` instances for `Word`, `Word8`, `Word16`, `Word32`, `Word64`
     [adamflott]
  * `Parsable` instances for `Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`, `Int64`, and `Natural`
  * Removed redundant `Monad` constraint on `middleware`

  ## 0.10.0

  * The monad parameters to `ScottyT` have been decoupled, causing the type
    of the `ScottyT` constructor to change. As a result, `ScottyT` is no
    longer a `MonadTrans` instance, and the type signatures of`scottyT`,
    `scottyAppT`, and `scottyOptsT` have been simplified. [ehamberg]

  * `socketDescription` no longer uses the deprecated `PortNum` constructor.
    Instead, it uses the `Show` instance for `PortNumber`. This changes the
    bytes from host to network order, so the output of `socketDescription`
    could change. [ehamberg]

  * `Alternative`, `MonadPlus` instances for `ActionT`

  * `scotty` now depends on `transformers-compat`. As a result, `ActionT` now
    uses `ExceptT`, regardless of which version of `transformers` is used.
    As a result, several functions in `Web.Scotty.Trans` no longer require a
    `ScottyError` constraint, since `ExceptT` does not require an `Error`
    constraint (unlike `ErrorT`).

  * Added support for OPTIONS routes via the `options` function [alvare]

  * Add `scottySocket` and `scottySocketT`, exposing Warp Unix socket support
    [hakujin]

  * `Parsable` instance for lazy `ByteString` [tattsun]

  * Added streaming uploads via the `bodyReader` function, which retrieves chunks
    of the request body. [edofic]
    - `ActionEnv` had a `getBodyChunk` field added (in
      `Web.Scotty.Internal.Types`)
    - `RequestBodyState` and `BodyPartiallyStreamed` added to
      `Web.Scotty.Internal.Types`

  * `jsonData` uses `aeson`'s `eitherDecode` instead of just `decode` [k-bx]

  ## 0.9.1

  * text/html/json only set Content-Type header when not already set

  ## 0.9.0

  * Add `charset=utf-8` to `Content-Type` for `text`, `html` and `json`

  * Assume HTTP status 500 for `defaultHandler`

  * Remove deprecated `source` method.

  * No longer depend on conduit.

  ## 0.8.2

  * Bump `aeson` upper bound

  * Fix `mtl` related deprecation warnings

  ## 0.8.1

  * Export internal types

  * Added `MonadBase`, `MonadTransControl` and `MonadBaseControl` instances for
    `ActionT`

  ## 0.8.0

  * Upgrade to wai/wai-extra/warp 3.0

  * No longer depend on conduit-extra.

  * The `source` response method has been deprecated in favor
    of a new `stream` response, matching changes in WAI 3.0.

  * Removed the deprecated `reqHeader` function.

  ## 0.7.3

  * Bump upper bound for case-insensitive, mtl and transformers.

  ## 0.7.2

  * Bump lower bound on conduit, add conduit-extra to cabal build depends.

  ## 0.7.1

  * Default warp settings now use `setFdCacheDuration 0` to work around a warp
    issue where file changes are not getting picked up.

  ## 0.7.0

  * Renamed `reqHeader` to `header`. Added `headers` function to get all headers.

  * Changed `MonadIO` instance for `ActionT` such that IO exceptions are lifted
    into `ScottyError`s via `stringError`.

  * Make `Bool` parsing case-insensitive. Goal: support both Haskell's True/False
    and Javascript's true/false. Thanks to Ben Gamari for suggesting this.

  * Bump `aeson`/`text` upper bounds.

  * Bump `wai`/`wai-extra`/`warp` bounds, including new lower bound for `warp`, which fixes a security issue related to Slowloris protection.

  ## 0.6.2

  * Bump upper bound for `text`.

  ## 0.6.1

  * Match changes in `wai-extra`.

  ## 0.6.0

  * The Scotty transformers (`ScottyT` and `ActionT`) are now parameterized
    over a custom exception type, allowing one to extend Scotty's `ErrorT`
    layer with something richer than `Text` errors. See the `exceptions`
    example for use. `ScottyM` and `ActionM` remain specialized to `Text`
    exceptions for simplicity.

  * Both monads are now instances of `Functor` and `Applicative`.

  * There is a new `cookies` example.

  * Internals brought up-to-date with WAI 2.0 and related packages.

  ## 0.5.0

  * The Scotty monads (`ScottyM` and `ActionM`) are now monad transformers,
    allowing Scotty applications to be embedded in arbitrary `MonadIO`s.
    The old API continues to be exported from `Web.Scotty` where:

          type ScottyM = ScottyT IO
          type ActionM = ActionT IO

    The new transformers are found in `Web.Scotty.Trans`. See the
    `globalstate` example for use. Special thanks to Dan Frumin (co-dan)
    for much of the legwork here.

  * Added support for HTTP PATCH method.

  * Removed lambda action syntax. This will return when we have a better
    story for typesafe routes.

  * `reqHeader :: Text -> ActionM Text` ==>
    `reqHeader :: Text -> ActionM (Maybe Text)`

  * New `raw` method to set body to a raw `ByteString`

  * Parse error thrown by `jsonData` now includes the body it couldn't parse.

  * `header` split into `setHeader` and `addHeader`. The former replaces
    a response header (original behavior). The latter adds a header (useful
    for multiple `Set-Cookie`s, for instance).

  # Scotty [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scotty-web/scotty.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/scotty-web/scotty)

  A Haskell web framework inspired by Ruby's Sinatra, using WAI and Warp.

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
  import Web.Scotty

  import Data.Monoid (mconcat)

  main = scotty 3000 $
      get "/:word" $ do
          beam <- param "word"
          html $ mconcat ["<h1>Scotty, ", beam, " me up!</h1>"]
  ```

  Scotty is the cheap and cheerful way to write RESTful, declarative web applications.

  * A page is as simple as defining the verb, URL pattern, and Text content.
  * It is template-language agnostic. Anything that returns a Text value will do.
  * Conforms to the [web application interface (WAI)](https://github.com/yesodweb/wai/).
  * Uses the very fast Warp webserver by default.

  See examples/basic.hs to see Scotty in action. (basic.hs needs the wai-extra package)

  ```bash
  > runghc examples/basic.hs
  Setting phasers to stun... (port 3000) (ctrl-c to quit)
  (visit localhost:3000/somepath)
  ```

  As for the name: Sinatra + Warp = Scotty.
