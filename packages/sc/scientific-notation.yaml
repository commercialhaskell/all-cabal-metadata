description: |-
  This library provides a type used to represent a number in
  scientific notation. This is most frequently useful when
  tokenizing or parsing a language. Languages like JSON and SQL
  support numberic literals written in scientific notation, even
  though backends frequently reject numbers outside a given range.
  This library provides a compact representation of numbers in
  scientific notation. In the common case of the coefficient and
  then exponent each being small enough to be represented by a
  machine word, this library avoids the need for any indirections
  to retrieve the number. Consider some tokenization scheme:
  `data Token = ... | Number {-# UNPACK #-} !Scientific`.
  In this case, the unboxed coefficient and exponent are unpacked
  into the `Number` data constructor if they can each be represented
  by a machine word.

  The internal representation does not normalize numbers. That is,
  parsing `300e-2` resulting in a representation that uses `300` and
  `-2` rather than `3` and `0`.
  This work is deferred with the expectation that a number in scientific
  notation is consumed either zero or one times. This library is not
  optimized for use-cases that consume a `Scientific` more than once
  since normalization is reapplied every time.

  The primary library that operates in this same space is `scientific`.
  Compared to `scientific`, this library distinguishes itself from
  `scientific` in the following ways:

  * Correctness: `scientific` does not correctly handle large exponents. See
  <https://github.com/basvandijk/scientific/issues/62 issue #62>.

  * Parsing: The `scientific-notation` parser outperforms the `scientific`
  parser that ships with `aeson` by a factor of five on small numbers.
