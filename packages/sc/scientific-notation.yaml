  # Revision history for scientific-notation

  ## 0.1.6.0 -- 2023-??-??O

  * Support GHC 9.4 and 9.6. Drop support for GHCs older than 9.4.
  * Add `fromInt` and `fromInt(8|16|32|64)`.

  ## 0.1.5.0 -- 2022-07-15

  * Support GHC 9.2.

  ## 0.1.4.0 -- 2022-03-16

  * Add `fromWord8`, `fromWord16`, and `fromWord32`.
  * Add `roundShiftedToInt64`.
  * Add `encode`.
  * Change `builderUtf8` to present numbers in decimal notation without exponent
    in many common cases. This is not considered a breaking change.

  ## 0.1.3.0 -- 2021-02-23

  * Add `greaterThanInt64`.
  * Add `fromWord64`.
  * Suppress zero exponent when encoding.

  ## 0.1.2.0 -- 2020-05-01

  * Add `builderUtf8`.

  ## 0.1.1.0 -- 2019-11-06

  * Add `withExposed`.
  * Start building with `-O2`.

  ## 0.1.0.1 -- 2019-09-30

  * Make compatible with `bytesmith-0.3`.

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2019-09-24

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

description: |-
  This library provides a type used to represent a number in
  scientific notation. This is most frequently useful when
  tokenizing or parsing a language. Languages like JSON and SQL
  support numberic literals written in scientific notation, even
  though backends frequently reject numbers outside a given range.
  This library provides a compact representation of numbers in
  scientific notation. In the common case of the coefficient and
  then exponent each being small enough to be represented by a
  machine word, this library avoids the need for any indirections
  to retrieve the number. Consider some tokenization scheme:
  `data Token = ... | Number {-# UNPACK #-} !Scientific`.
  In this case, the unboxed coefficient and exponent are unpacked
  into the `Number` data constructor if they can each be represented
  by a machine word.

  The internal representation does not normalize numbers. That is,
  parsing `300e-2` resulting in a representation that uses `300` and
  `-2` rather than `3` and `0`.
  This work is deferred with the expectation that a number in scientific
  notation is consumed either zero or one times. This library is not
  optimized for use-cases that consume a `Scientific` more than once
  since normalization is reapplied every time.

  The primary library that operates in this same space is `scientific`.
  Compared to `scientific`, this library distinguishes itself from
  `scientific` in the following ways:

  * Correctness: `scientific` does not correctly handle large exponents. See
  <https://github.com/basvandijk/scientific/issues/62 issue #62>.

  * Parsing: The `scientific-notation` parser outperforms the `scientific`
  parser that ships with `aeson` by a factor of five on small numbers.
