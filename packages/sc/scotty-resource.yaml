  # scotty-resource

  This module defines better resource routing for Scotty.

  Scotty is defined in terms of "routes", whereas HTTP is defined in
  terms of "resources".  This package adds a "resource" abstraction to
  the scotty ecosystem.

  (note: All examples probably require -XOverloadedStrings)

  Scotty comes out of the box with a way to model "routes". The problem
  is that "routes" is not the abstraction used by the HTTP standard and
  it can sometimes be tricky to write a perfectly correct HTTP service
  using the routes model (where "correct" is judged against rfc-2616).
  The most blatant, (and who knows, maybe the only) example of this problem
  is shown by the scotty code:

  ```haskell
  import Web.Scotty.Trans (get, scottyT, text)

  ...

  scottyT 8080 id $ do
    get "/hello" $ do
      text "world"
  ```

  If a client requests something like `DELETE /hello`, this scotty application
  will return `404 Not Found`, which conflicts with section 5.1.1 of rfc-2616.
  A better response would be `405 Method Not Allowed`, and it would include an
  automatically generated `Allow` response header.

  This library gives users a way to model "resources" which is closer to the
  abstractions used in the HTTP standard.

  We can re-write the above example like this:

  ```haskell
  import Web.Scotty.Trans (scottyT, text)
  import Web.Scotty.Resource.Trans (resource, get)

  ...

  scottyT 8080 id $ do
    resource "/hello" $ do
      get $ do
        text "world"
  ```

  Given a request:

  ```http
  DELETE /hello HTTP/1.1
  Host: localhost:8080
  ```

  The resource-based scotty application will produce something like:

  ```http
  HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
  Allow: GET
  ```

  Each resource is described by a `WebResource` value, which happens to be a
  `Monad`. The only reason `WebResource` implements `Monad` to fit in with the
  do-notation coding style of `ScottyT`. This is an abuse of `Monad`, but, you
  know, whatever. The `Monoid` typeclass more correctly represents what a
  `WebResource` really is. The `Monad` and `Monoid` typeclasses are used to
  compose instances of `WebResource`.

  Here is another more complex example, with multiple resources.

  ```haskell
  import Data.Aeson (decode)
  import Network.HTTP.Types (notFound404, badRequest400, noContent204)
  import Web.Scotty.Resource.Trans (resource, get, post)
  import Web.Scotty.Trans (scottyT, text, body, raw, status, param)

  import MyApplication (lookupPerson, storePerson)

  ...

  scottyT 8080 id $ do

    -- an "echo" resource
    resource "/echo" $ do
      get $ do
        text "hello world"
      post $ do
        -- echo the request body back to the user
        raw =<< body

    -- A resource that represents a kind of a RESTful database of people.
    -- This resource supports GET and PUT.
    resource "/people/:personId" $ do
      get $ do
        personId <- param "personId"
        maybePerson <- lookupPerson personId
        case maybePerson of
          Nothing ->
            status notFound404
          Just person ->
            json person
      put $ do
        personId <- param "personId"
        maybePerson <- decode <$> body
        case maybePerson of
          Nothing -> do
            status badRequest400
            text "Invalid person JSON"
          Just person ->
            storePerson personId person
            status noContent204
  ```
