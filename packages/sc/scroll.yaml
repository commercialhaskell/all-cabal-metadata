    * Fix a minor bug when moving over punctuation that was not swallowed.

  scroll (1.20150314) unstable; urgency=medium

    * This is a post-7drl release that does not change any gameplay.
    * Support use as a pager, with input piped in on stdin, as long
      as the unix module is available.
    * Rename Setup.hs since cabal uses that name.
      Thanks to Sergei Trofimovich of Gentoo, which has packaged scroll!
    * Don't crash on exceedingly small input files when being used as a
      pager.

   -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sat, 14 Mar 2015 15:32:28 -0400

  scroll (1.20150313) unstable; urgency=low

    * First release, at the end of 7DRL 2015!
    * Thanks to all my playtesters, and to the 7DRL community.

  You're a bookworm that's stuck on a scroll. You have to
