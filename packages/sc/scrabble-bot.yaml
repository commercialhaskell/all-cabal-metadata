description: ! 'A small program for generating plays for Scrabble tables.

  Currently only the classic Scrabble board layout is supported and the user interface
  is pretty much nonexistent.

  You can change the board, the rack and the number of plays displayed by manually
  editing the Main source file and rebuilding.

  Hence, downloading the source distribution is advised.'
