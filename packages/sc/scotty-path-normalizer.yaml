  # Scotty path normalizer

  This library provides a [Scotty] action that normalizes the HTTP request target
  as if it were a Unix file path. When the path normalization action detects a
  path that can be simplified in one of the following ways, it issues a [redirect]
  to a more canonical path.

  1. Remove trailing slashes: `https://typeclasses.com/contravariance/`
     becomes `https://typeclasses.com/contravariance`
  2. Remove double slashes: `https://typeclasses.com//web-servers////lesson-4`
     becomes `https://typeclasses.com/web-servers/lesson-4`
  3. Remove `.` segments, because `.` represents "the current directory":
     `https://typeclasses.com/ghc/./scoped-type-variables` becomes
     `https://typeclasses.com/ghc/scoped-type-variables`
  4. Remove segments of the form `xyz/..`, because `..` represents "the parent
     directory": `https://typeclasses.com/python/../javascript/monoidal-folds`
     becomes `https://typeclasses.com/javascript/monoidal-folds`

  The typical way to apply this to your Scotty server is to put
  `addPathNormalizer` at the top of your `ScottyM` app definition.

  ```haskell
  import qualified Web.Scotty as Scotty
  import Web.Scotty.PathNormalizer (addPathNormalizer)

  main :: IO ()
  main =
      Scotty.scotty 3000 $
        do
          addPathNormalizer

          Scotty.get (Scotty.capture "/:word") $
            do
              beam <- Scotty.param (Data.Text.Lazy.pack "word")
              Scotty.html $ fold
                  [ Data.Text.Lazy.pack "<h1>Scotty, "
                  , beam
                  , Data.Text.Lazy.pack " me up!</h1>"
                  ]
  ```
