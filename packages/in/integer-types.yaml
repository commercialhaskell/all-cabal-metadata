  ## Core types: Integer, Natural, Positive

  The primary module of the `integer-types` package is `Integer`, which exports
  the following integer-like types:

  Type          | Range
  --------------|------------
  `Integer`     | (-∞, ∞)
  `Natural`     | (0, ∞)
  `Positive`    | (1, ∞)

  ## The Signed type

  In addition to `Integer`, there is also an equivalent type called `Signed` that
  is represented as:

  ```haskell
  data Signed = Zero | NonZero Sign Positive

  data Sign = MinusSign | PlusSign
  ```

  `Signed` also comes with bundled pattern synonyms that allow it to be used as if
  it had the following definition:

  ```haskell
  data Signed = Minus Positive | Zero | Plus Positive
  ```

  ## Monomorphic conversions

  The following modules contain monomorphic conversion functions:

  - `Integer.Integer`
  - `Integer.Natural`
  - `Integer.Positive`
  - `Integer.Signed`

  For example, you can convert from `Positive` to `Integer` using either
  `Integer.Positive.toInteger` or `Integer.Integer.fromPositive`, which are two
  names for the same function of type `Positive -> Integer`.

  Since not all integers are positive, the corresponding function in the reverse
  direction has a `Maybe` codomain. `Integer.Integer.toPositive` and
  `Integer.Positive.fromInteger` have the type `Integer -> Maybe Positive`.

  ## Polymorphic conversions

  The `Integer` module exports two polymorphic conversion functions. The first is
  for conversions that always succeed, such as `Positive -> Integer`.

  ```haskell
  convert :: IntegerConvert a b => a -> b
  ```

  The second is for conversions that may fail because they convert to a subset of
  the domain, such as `Integer -> Maybe Positive`.

  ```haskell
  narrow :: IntegerNarrow a b => a -> Maybe b
  ```

  ## Finite integer subsets

  In addition to the conversion utilities discussed above, this library also
  provides some minimal support for converting to/from the `Word` and `Int` types.
  These are system-dependent finite subsets of `Integer` that are sometimes used
  for performance reasons.

  ```haskell
  toFinite   :: (ConvertWithFinite a, Finite b) => a -> Maybe b
  fromFinite :: (ConvertWithFinite a, Finite b) => b -> Maybe a
  ```

  For example, `toFinite` may specialize as `Positive -> Maybe Int`, and
  `fromFinite` may specialize as `Int -> Maybe Positive`.

  ## Monomorphic subtraction

  For the `Integer` and `Signed` types that represent the full range of integers,
  the standard arithmetic operations in the `Num` and `Integral` classes are
  suitable.

  For `Natural` and `Positive`, which are subsets of the integers, the standard
  classes are not entirely appropriate. Consider, for example, subtraction.

  ```haskell
  (-) :: Num a => a -> a -> a
  ```

  `Natural` and `Positive` do belong to the `Num` class, but subtraction and some
  other operations are partial; the expression `1 - 2` throws instead of returning
  a value, because the integer result `-1` is negative and not representable by
  either `Natural` or `Positive`.

  For this reason, `Natural` and `Positive` have their own subtraction functions
  that return `Signed`.

  ```haskell
  -- from Integer.Positive
  subtract :: Positive -> Positive -> Signed

  -- from Integer.Natural
  subtract :: Natural -> Natural -> Signed
  ```

  ## Polymorphic subtraction

  In addition to the `(-)` method from the `Num` class and the `subtract`
  functions for `Natural` and `Positive`, there are some polymorphic subtraction
  functions in the `Integer` module. `subtractSigned` generalizes the two
  monomorphic functions discussed in the previous section. Its codomain is
  `Signed`.

  ```haskell
  subtractSigned :: forall a. Subtraction a =>
      a -> a -> Signed
  ```

  `subtractInteger` does the same thing, but gives the result as `Integer` instead
  of `Signed`.

  ```haskell
  subtractInteger :: forall a. Subtraction a =>
      a -> a -> Integer
  ```

  The `subtract` function generalizes further. Its domain is any subtractable type
  (`Natural`, `Positive`, `Integer`, or `Signed`) and its codomain is any type
  that can represent the full range of integers (`Integer` or `Signed`).

  ```haskell
  subtract :: forall b a. (Subtraction' b, Subtraction a) =>
      a -> a -> b
  ```
