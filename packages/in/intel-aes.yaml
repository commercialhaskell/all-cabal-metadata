description: |-
  AES encryption with optional hardware acceleration.  Plus,
  statistically sound, splittable random number generation based on AES.
  This package is nothing more than a wrapper around the Intel-provided
  AESNI sample library which also includes a portable software
  implementation of AES by Brian Gladman.  It contains C,
  assembly, and Haskell sources.  And it includes prebuilt dynamic
  libraries to make the build process less fragile.
  (Rebuilding requires the @yasm@ assembler.)  But prebuilt shared
  libraries are not included for all platforms yet.  (Volunteers
  needed!)
  Finally, note that this package is currently triggering some haddock
  problems. A manually built copy of the documentation can be found
  at:
