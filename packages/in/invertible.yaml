  Haskell bidirectional arrows, bijective functions, and invariant functors

  Representations and operations for bidirectional arrows (total isomorphisms: an
  arrow paired with its inverse).  Classes for invariant functors and monoidal
  functors.  Includes a number of useful bijections and operations, as well as
  interoperability with related packages.

  See also: semigroupoids, TypeCompose, lens, semi-iso, partial-isomorphisms, and
  Piso packages.
