description: |-
  This library defines a complete collection of conversion functions between machine integers:
  @wordToWord32@, @word32ToWord64@ etc.

  All these functions behave like @fromIntegral@, but avoid going through @Integer@. (GHC has a specific optimisation to remove an intermediate @Integer@ from @fromIntegral@ conversions, but if we can be explicit, and wont need to rely on an optimisation, why wouldn't we?)

  There are also conversion to/from @Char@. Convertions to @Char@ are __unsafe__, as these allow to create invalid @Char@ values (negative, or larger then maximum codepoint).
  In particular @intToChar@ is not the same as @chr@; @chr@ performs bounds check; @intToChar@ doesn't.
  Conversion from @Char@ are equivalent to @fromIntegral . ord@.
  Conversion to @Char@ are equivalent to @intToChar . fromIntegral@, which __does not__ perform bounds checks.

  Only GHC>=9.4 is supported, as the primitive integers had been reworked in GHC-9.4.

  This package deliberately doesn't provide any abstraction over the conversion functions.
