description: |-
  The Haskell parser does not consider the fixity
  of operators when parsing infix applications.
  All infix applications are thus parsed as
  if the operators were all left associative with
  the same precedence.
  This module contains code for re-parsing infix
  applications taking into account the fixity of
  operators.
  The important algorithm is the well known
  operator precedence parsing algorithm. See
  comments in the code for more detailed
  information.
