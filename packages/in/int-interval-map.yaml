  # IntervalIntMap

  An interval map structure that is optimized for low memory (each interval is
  represented by about 3 words + whatever the cargo is) and has semantics that
  are appropriate for genomic intervals (namely, intervals can overlap and
  queries will return **all** matches together). It also designed to be used in
  two phases: a construction phase + query phase).

  This is not a general purpose package, it serves mostly as support for
  [NGLess](https://ngless.embl.de) and is used there.

  Do get [in touch](mailto:luis@luispedro.org) if you want to use it more
  generally, but the plans for this repo is to develop it only in so far as it
  helps with NGLess' goals.

  ## Example Usage

  ### Step 1: construction

  In the first phase, an `IntervalIntMapAccumulator` accumulator is used. This is
  a mutable object and it must be used inside a `PrimMonad` (typically either
  `IO` or `ST s`). Elements can be inserted into this object.

  ```haskell
  import qualified Data.IntervalIntMap as IM

  insertMany :: [(Int, Int)] -> IO (IM.IntervalIntMap Int)
  insertMany elems = do
      acc <- IM.new
      forM_ (zip elems [0..]) $ \((s,p), ix) ->
          IM.insert (IM.Interval s p) ix
      IM.unsafeFreeze acc
  ```

  The final step in _construction_ is freezing the accumulator to produce a
  `IntervalIntMap`. If the original accumulator is not to be used again, then
  `unsafeFreeze` can be used.

  ### Step 2: usage

  The `IntervalIntMap` object is a pure object, with the typical container
  functions: `map`, `lookup`, `elems`,...

  Do note that the signature for `lookup` is

  ```haskell
  lookup ::  Storable a => Int -> IntervalIntMap a -> [a]
  ```

  Thus, a list is always returned: `[]` if nothing is found, but multiple
  intervals can independently overlap with the query.
