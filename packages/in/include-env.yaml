description: "# include-env\n\nEmbed secrets (e.g. API keys) from environment variables
  inside production artifacts without checking them into the repository. \n\nThis
  use case is relevant e.g. in continuous integration (CI) settings.\n\n# Example
  \n\nIn GitHub each private repository can have a number of secrets, which can be
  conveniently changed without being exposed as needed; GitHub Actions can pass repository
  secrets in as environment variables during any step, which is where this library
  comes in handy.\n"
