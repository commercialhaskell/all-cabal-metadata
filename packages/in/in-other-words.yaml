  # Changelog for `in-other-words`

  ## 0.2.1.1 (2022-06-15)
  ### Non-breaking Changes
  * GHC 9.2.3 compatiblity

  ## 0.2.1.0 (2021-11-05)
  ### Non-breaking Changes
  * Added `hoistSteps`
  * Added `threadBaseControlViaUnlift`
  * GHC 9.0.1 compatiblity (thanks @berberman!)

  ## 0.2.0.0 (2021-01-30)
  ### Breaking Changes
  * `-Fast` interpretations of every continuation-related effect have been removed due
    to lack of usefulness.
  * The `ThreadsEff (ContT r) (ReaderPrim i)` instance has been removed due to unlawfulness.
  * `Control.Monad.Trans.List.Church` and `Control.Monad.Trans.Free.Church.Alternate` have
      received a minor revamp. Notably, the representations of `ListT` and `FreeT` have been
      changed to become lawful monad transformers.
  * `bracketToIO` now executes the cleanup action of any `generalBracket`
      _uninterruptibly masked_.

  ### Non-breaking Changes
  * Fixed a bug where `listen` when using `listenToIO` would be lifted incorrectly by carriers
      based on `FreeT` and `ListT`, which arose due to these not having been lawful
      monad transformers.
  * All uses of `CompositionC` in the library has been changed to proper newtypes.
      This should improve the quality of error messages as well as compilation times.
  * Added `bracketToIOUnsafe`, which has the previous semantics of `bracketToIO`
      -- that is, the cleanup action of each `generalBracket` is only executed
      _interruptibly masked_.
  * `Control.Efffect.Newtype` now exports the constructors of `WrapperOf`, thus
       addressing an issue where users wouldn't be allowed to derive via `WrapperOf`.
  * `Control.Efffect.Carrier` now exports the constructors of `IdentityT`, thus
       addressing an issue where users wouldn't be allowed to derive via `IdentityT`.
  * Fixed an issue where `FailC` lacked a `MonadFail` instance.
  * Added `errorToIOAsExc` and `errorToErrorIOAsExc` (thanks @poscat0x04!)


  ## 0.1.1.0 (2020-10-30)
  ### Non-breaking Changes
  * Added `runTellAction` and `ignoreTell` interpreters.
  * Added `runEmbed` interpreter
  * Fixed an issue with `runShift` where HO-actions applied on a `shift` could affect the continuation provided to the argument of `shift`.


  ## 0.1.0.0 (2020-10-10)
  Initial release.

  https://github.com/KingoftheHomeless/in-other-words#performance\n\n## Overview\n`in-other-words`
  is an effect system in the vein of [`freer-simple`](https://github.com/lexi-lambda/freer-simple),\n[`fused-effects`](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects),\n[`polysemy`](https://github.com/polysemy-research/polysemy),\nand
  [`eff`](https://github.com/hasura/eff). It represents effects through data types,\nmaking
  it simple to define, use, and interpret them.\n\nThe goal of `in-other-words` is
  to be as expressive and general of an\neffect system as possible while solving the
  *O(n<sup>2</sup>)* instances\nproblem. Its hallmark feature is the novel approach
  it takes to support\nhigher-order effects, making it significantly more powerful
  -- and sometimes\neasier to use -- than other effect libraries of its kind.\n\nIf
  you're experienced with the mechanisms behind `freer-simple`,\n`fused-effects`,
  and `polysemy`, and would like to learn more about what makes\n`in-other-words`
  different, see\n[this wiki page](https://github.com/KingoftheHomeless/in-other-words/wiki/The-Inner-Workings-of-the-Library).\n\nUnfortunately,
  in its current state `in-other-words` is rather inaccessible.\nAmple documentation
  and guides are provided for the library, but inexperienced\nusers are still likely
  to run into gotchas that result in very\nconfusing error messages. As such, if you're
  a beginner to effect systems,\n`freer-simple` or `polysemy` would serve as better
  starting points.\n\n## Features\n\n### Simple higher-order effects\nUnlike `fused-effects`
  and `polysemy` -- which both have intimidating\nboilerplate associated with the
  interpretation of higher-order effects\n--`in-other-words` makes it just as easy
  to interpret higher-order effects as\nfirst-order effects. Go [here](#higher-order)
  for an example.\n\n### No cumbersome restrictions to effects\nEvery effect system
  previously mentioned has serious restrictions in what\neffects they may represent.\n*
  `freer-simple` is restricted to first-order effects.\n* `fused-effects` and `polysemy`
  are built around\n[*Effect Handlers in Scope*](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nicolas.wu/papers/Scope.pdf),\nwhose
  approach doesn't allow for sensible implementations of effects for\ncontinuations,
  coroutines, or nondeterminism.\n* `eff` is limited to what's implementable with
  delimited continuations, which\nexcludes actions such as\n[`pass`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl-2.2.2/docs/Control-Monad-Writer-Class.html#v:pass)\nfrom
  `MonadWriter`, and `async`/`await` style concurrency.\n\n`in-other-words` also places
  restrictions on what effects may be represented\n-- but in contrast to the libraries
  mentioned above, these restrictions are\nalmost completely negligable.<sup id=\"a1\">[1](#f1)</sup>
  This is possible because\nunlike most other effect systems, `in-other-words` does
  not attempt to make\nevery possible effect play nicely together with every other
  effect: instead,\njust like `mtl`, some effects can't be used together with other
  effects\n(depending on how they're interpreted),\nand this is enforced by constraints
  that interpreters may introduce.\n\n## Required Language Extensions\nThe following
  extensions are needed for basic usage of the library:\n\n```\n  - ConstraintKinds\n
  \ - DataKinds\n  - FlexibleContexts\n  - GADTs\n  - LambdaCase\n  - PolyKinds\n
  \ - RankNTypes\n  - TypeApplications\n  - TypeOperators\n  - TypeFamilies\n```\n\nSome
  features of the library could require enabling more extensions.\n\n\n## Examples
  of Simple Usage\n\nFirst-order usage:\n```haskell\nimport Control.Effect\nimport
  Control.Effect.Error\nimport Control.Effect.State\nimport Control.Effect.Reader\nimport

  writeTTY \"Nope.\" >> challenge\n\n\n-- Interpret a Teletype effect in terms of
  IO operations\nteletypeToIO :: Eff (Embed IO) m => SimpleInterpreterFor Teletype

  @String\n    -- Run the @State [String]@ effect with initial state\n    -- @testInputs@.
  @evalState@ discards the end state.\n  $ evalState testInputs\n    -- Interpret

  \ Timing of spinAndFail failed due to some error!\n  *** Exception: Prelude.undefined\n-}\n```\n\n##
  Advanced Usage\n\nThe examples above are somewhat disingenuous; they cover only
  the simplest\nuses of the library. The library has a wide variety of features,\nand
  using them properly can get very complicated. Because of this,\n[`in-other-words`
  offers a wiki covering more advanced topics of the\nlibrary.](https://github.com/KingoftheHomeless/in-other-words/wiki/Advanced-Topics)\nCheck
  it out if you're interested in learning more about the\nlibrary,  or are struggling
  with a feature.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n[The wiki has a page for common error messages.](https://github.com/KingoftheHomeless/in-other-words/wiki/Common-Error-Messages-and-Issues)\nIf
  you run into any issues or strange error messages that you can't figure out\nfrom
  the wiki, feel free to make an issue about it. If not already covered, and\nif I
  can generalize the problem enough, then I'll expand the wiki to cover the\nissue.\n\n##
  Performance\nIn the microbenchmarks offered by [`effects-zoo`](https://github.com/ocharles/effect-zoo/)\n`in-other-words`
  performs comparably to `mtl` and `fused-effects`;\nat worst up to 2x slower than
  `fused-effects`. \nKeep in mind, however, that these *are* only microbenchmarks,
  and may not\npredict performance in the wild with perfect accuracy.\n[The benchmark
  results are available here.](https://github.com/KingoftheHomeless/in-other-words/wiki/Benchmarks)\n\n`in-other-words`
  is, like `mtl` and `fused-effects`, limited\nby how effectively the compiler is
  able to optimize away the\nunderlying abstractions.\n[As noted by Alexis King](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/313#issuecomment-590143835),\nthe
  ideal situations under which these libraries are truly zero-cost are unrealistic\nin
  practice. Although this does adversely affect `in-other-words`,\nthe underlying
  dispatch cost of effects should be low enough to make\nto it largely negligable
  for most purposes -- in particular, IO-bound\napplications.\n\nFurther benchmarking,
  profiling, and optimizations are currently\nconsidered future goals of the library.\n\n***\n<b
  id=\"f1\">[1](#a1)</b> Every effect is required to be *representational*\nin the
  carrier monad. This means that if you can represent your effect using:\n* a `mtl`-style
  effect class\n* without any associated type families\n* and it can be newtype derived\n\nthen
  you can also represent your effect with `in-other-words`.\n"
