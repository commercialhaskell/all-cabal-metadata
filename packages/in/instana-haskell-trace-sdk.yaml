description: "# Instana Haskell Trace SDK &nbsp; [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/instana/haskell-trace-sdk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/instana/haskell-trace-sdk)\n\nMonitor
  your Haskell application with [Instana](https://www.instana.com/)! \U0001F389\n\nDisclaimer\n----------\n\nThe
  Instana Haskell Trace SDK is a labor of love from some of our engineers and work
  on it is done in their spare time. Haskell is currently not a platform that we officialy
  support. The experience may differ from other programming languages and platforms
  that Instana actively supports (such as Java, .NET, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, PHP,
  ...). That said, the SDK is a fully functional piece of software, so don't let this
  disclaimer discourage you from using it. If you use Instana or consider using it
  and Haskell support is crucial for you, make sure to give us a ping and let's talk
  about it.\n\nWhat The Haskell Trace SDK Is And What It Is Not\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe
  Instana Haskell Trace SDK does not support automatic instrumentation/tracing in
  the way we support it in most other languages. Instead, the SDK enables you to create
  spans manually, much like the [Instana Trace SDK for Java](https://docs.instana.io/core_concepts/tracing/java_trace_sdk/)
  does. Besides offering a convenient API to create spans, the Haskell Trace SDK also
  takes care of establishing a connection to the Instana Agent and sending spans to
  the agent in an efficient way, that does not impede the performance of your production
  code.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n**NOTE: Currently, the `instana-haskell-trace-sdk`
  has not been published on Hackage yet, so adding it to your dependencies will not
  work yet. It will be published soon. Stay tuned!**\n\n<s>To use the Instana Haskell
  Trace SDK in your application, add `instana-haskell-trace-sdk` to your dependencies
  (for example to the `build-depends` section of your cabal file).</s>\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n###
  Initialization\n\nBefore using the SDK, you need to initialize it once, usually
  during application startup.\n\n```\nimport qualified Instana.SDK.SDK as InstanaSDK\n\nmain
  :: IO ()\nmain = do\n  -- ... initialize things ...\n\n  -- initialize Instana\n
  \ instana <- InstanaSDK.initInstana\n\n  -- ... initialize more things\n```\n\nThe
  value `instana :: Instana.SDK.SDK.InstanaContext` that is returned by `InstanaSDK.initInstana`
  is required for all further calls, that is, for creating spans that will be send
  to the agent. The SDK will try to connect to an agent (asynchronous, in a a separate
  thread) as soon as it receives the `initInstana` call.\n\nThe SDK can be configured
  via environment variables or directly in the code by passing configuration parameters
  to the initialization function, or both.\n\nIf you would like to pass configuration
  parameters programatically, use `initConfiguredInstana` instead of `initInstana`:\n\n```\nimport
  qualified Instana.SDK.SDK as InstanaSDK\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n\n  -- Example
  snippet for using the Instana SDK and providing a configuration\n  -- (agent host,
  port, ...) directly in code. You only need to specify the\n  -- configuration values
  you are interested in and can omit everything else\n  -- (see https://www.yesodweb.com/book/settings-types).\n
  \ let\n    config =\n      InstanaSDK.defaultConfig\n        { InstanaSDK.agentHost
  = Just \"127.0.0.1\"\n        , InstanaSDK.agentPort = Just 42699\n        , InstanaSDK.forceTransmissionAfter
  = Just 1000\n        , InstanaSDK.forceTransmissionStartingAt = Just 500\n        ,
  InstanaSDK.maxBufferedSpans = Just 1000\n        }\n  instana <- InstanaSDK.initConfiguredInstana
  config\n```\n\nFor configuration parameters that are omitted when creating the config
  record or are set to `Nothing`, the SDK will fall back to environment variables
  (see below) and then to default values.\n\nThere are also [bracket-style](https://wiki.haskell.org/Bracket_pattern)
  variants of the initialization function, called `withInstana` and `withConfiguredInstana`:\n\n```\nimport
  qualified Instana.SDK.SDK as InstanaSDK\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n  InstanaSDK.withInstana
  runApp\n\nrunApp :: InstanaContext -> IO ()\nrunApp instana = do\n  -- do your thing
  here :-)\n```\n\nor, with bracket style and a configuration record:\n\n```\nimport
  qualified Instana.SDK.SDK as InstanaSDK\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n  let\n    config
  =\n      InstanaSDK.defaultConfig\n        { InstanaSDK.agentHost = Just \"127.0.0.1\"\n
  \       , InstanaSDK.agentPort = Just 42699\n        , InstanaSDK.forceTransmissionAfter
  = Just 1000\n        , InstanaSDK.forceTransmissionStartingAt = Just 500\n        ,
  InstanaSDK.maxBufferedSpans = Just 1000\n        }\n\n  InstanaSDK.withConfiguredInstana
  config runApp\n\nrunApp :: InstanaContext -> IO ()\nrunApp instana = do\n  -- do
  your thing here :-)\n```\n\n### Creating Spans\n\n#### Bracket Style (High Level
  API)\n\nAll functions starting with `with` accept (among other parameters) an IO
  action. The SDK will start a span before, then execute the given IO action and complete
  the span afterwards. Using this style is recommended over the low level API that
  requires you to start and complete spans yourself.\n\n* `withRootEntry`: Creates
  an entry span that is the root of a trace (it has no parent span).\n* `withEntry`:
  Creates an entry span that has a parent span.\n* `withExit`: Creates an exit span.
  This can only be called inside a `withRootEntry` or an `withEntry` call, as an exit
  span needs an entry span as its parent.\n\n#### Low Level API/Explicit Start And
  Complete\n\n* `startRootEntry`: Starts an entry span that is the beginning of a
  trace (has no parent span). You will need to call `completeEntry` at some point.\n*
  `startEntry`: Starts an entry span. You will need to call `completeEntry` at some
  point.\n* `startExit`: Starts an exit span. You need to call `completeExit`/`completeExitWithData`
  at some point with the partial exit span value that is returned by this function.\n*
  `completeEntry`: Finalizes an entry span. This will put the span into the SDK's
  span buffer for transmission to the Instana agent.\n* `completeExit`: Finalizes
  an exit span. This will put the span into the SDK's span buffer for transmission
  to the Instana agent.\n\n### Configuration Via Environment Variables\n\nInstead
  of configuring the SDK programatically, as seen above, it can also be configured
  via environment variables:\n\n* `INSTANA_AGENT_HOST`: The IP or the host of the
  Instana agent to connect to. Default: 127.0.0.1.\n* `INSTANA_AGENT_PORT`: The port
  of the Instana agent to connect to. Default: 42699.\n* `INSTANA_AGENT_NAME`: When
  establishing a connection to the Instana agent, the SDK validates the Instana agent's
  `Server` HTTP response header. Should you have changed the Server name on the agent
  side, you can use this environment variable to provide the name to match that header
  against.\n* `INSTANA_FORCE_TRANSMISSION_STARTING_AFTER`: Spans are usually buffered
  before being transmitted to the agent. This setting forces the transmission of all
  buffered spans after the given amount of milliseconds. Default: 1000.\n* `INSTANA_FORCE_TRANSMISSION_STARTING_AT`:
  This setting forces the transmission of all buffered spans when the given number
  of spans has been buffered.\n* `INSTANA_MAX_BUFFERED_SPANS`: Limits the number of
  spans to buffer. When the limit is reached, spans will be dropped. This setting
  is a safe guard against memory leaks from buffering excessive amounts of spans.
  It must be larger than `INSTANA_FORCE_TRANSMISSION_STARTING_AT`.\n* `INSTANA_LOG_LEVEL`:
  See section \"Configure Debug Logging\".\n* `INSTANA_LOG_LEVEL_STDOUT`: See section
  \"Configure Debug Logging\".\n* `INSTANA_OVERRIDE_HSLOGGER_ROOT_HANDLER`: See section
  \"Configure Debug Logging\".\n\n### Configure Debug Logging\n\nIf required, the
  Instana Haskell SDK can produce logs via [hslogger](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hslogger).
  Under normal circumstances, the SDK does not emit any log output at all. It will
  only output log messages when logging is explicitly enabled via certain environment
  variables. This can be useful to troubleshoot tracing in production settings or
  during development.\n\n#### Logging Related Environment Variables\n\n* `INSTANA_LOG_LEVEL`:
  Sets the log level for the SDK's log file. The log file will be written to the system's
  temporary directory (in particular, whatever `System.Directory.getTemporaryDirectory`
  returns) as `instana-haskell-sdk.{pid}.log`.\n* `INSTANA_LOG_LEVEL_STDOUT`: Sets
  the level for emitting log messages to stdout.\n* `INSTANA_OVERRIDE_HSLOGGER_ROOT_HANDLER`:
  Controls whether the SDK sets an hslogger at the root logger level, see below.\n\n####
  When To Set `INSTANA_OVERRIDE_HSLOGGER_ROOT_HANDLER`\n\nSetting up hslogger correctly
  inside a library like the Instana Haskell SDK (as opposed to an application which
  has full control) can be tricky. For the Instana Haskell SDK to be able to correctly
  configure hslogger, it is important to know whether the app in question (or some
  part of it) already uses hslogger. In particular, does some part of the code set
  a handler on hslogger's root logger? Is a call like the following executed somewhere
  in the application?\n\n```\nimport System.Log.Logger (rootLoggerName, setHandlers,
  updateGlobalLogger)\n\nupdateGlobalLogger rootLoggerName $ setHandlers [...]\n```\n\nIf
  this is the case, you can simply use `INSTANA_LOG_LEVEL` (or `INSTANA_LOG_LEVEL_STDOUT`)
  without further configuration. If the app in question does not use hslogger, that
  is, if no `setHandler` call on `rootLoggerName` is executed, you should also set\n`INSTANA_OVERRIDE_HSLOGGER_ROOT_HANDLER`
  to a non-empty string (for example, `INSTANA_OVERRIDE_HSLOGGER_ROOT_HANDLER=true`).\n\n####
  Troubleshooting Tracing In Production\n\nIf your app already uses hslogger, use:\n\n*
  `INSTANA_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`\n\nOtherwise, use:\n\n* `INSTANA_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG INSTANA_OVERRIDE_HSLOGGER_ROOT_HANDLER=true`\n\n####
  Development\n\nDuring development (that is, when working on the Instana Haskell
  SDK), use either\n\n* `INSTANA_LOG_LEVEL_STDOUT=DEBUG`\n\nor\n\n* `INSTANA_LOG_LEVEL_STDOUT=DEBUG`\n*
  `INSTANA_OVERRIDE_HSLOGGER_ROOT_HANDLER=true`\n\ndepending on whether the application
  already uses and configures hslogger. The application `example-app` that is contained
  in the Instana Haskell SDK's repo configures hslogger, so simply using `INSTANA_LOG_LEVEL_STDOUT=DEBUG`
  is correct.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/instana/haskell-trace-sdk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n"
