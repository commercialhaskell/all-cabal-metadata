description: "# Intricacy\nA game of competitive puzzle-design.\n\nhttps://mbays.sdf.org/intricacy/\n\n##
  Configuration\nYou can change keybindings in SDL mode by right-clicking on the corresponding\nbutton
  and pressing a key.\n\nConfig files are saved in `~/.intricacy/` on unixoids, or
  something like\n`...\\Application Data\\intricacy\\` on windows. In particular,
  the locks you\ncreate in the lock editor are saved in there (and you can organise
  them into\ndirectories by including (back)slashs in the lock name). You can edit
  them in\na text editor if you want - see AsciiLock.hs for what the characters mean.\n\nIf
  you want to cheat your way past initiation, change \"False\" to \"True\" in\n`metagame.conf`.\n\n\n##
  Rough description of the game mechanics\n* Locks consist of blocks, pivots and balls.
  Blocks can be connected to other\n    blocks by springs. Pivots have arms. When
  picking a lock, you control two\n    tools - a hook, which acts as a mobile one-armed
  pivot, and a wrench,\n    which acts as a mobile block with momentum.\n* To open
  a lock, the \"bolthole\" (the area in the top-right) must be empty.\n* Each turn,
  the tools push and rotate according to the player's commands, and\n    then each
  spring which is compressed or extended beyond its natural length\n    pushes/pulls
  on the block at its end.\n* If two forces try to move a piece in two different directions,
  or try to\n    move two pieces into the same hex, one or both is blocked.\n* If
  a pivot/hook is trying to turn and there's a piece in the way of one of\n    its
  arms, it will at first try to push the piece away - but if that force\n    is blocked,
  it will try instead to pull the piece round with the arm as it\n    turns.\n* If
  two springs are trying to push two blocks into the same hex, they will\n    generally
  both be blocked. However, if one of the forces is also pushing\n    against a fixed
  piece such as a tool, it won't block the other force.\n\n\n## Full details of the
  metagame mechanics\n(Where by the 'game' I mean the lock-picking bit, and by the
  'metagame' I mean\nthe bit with the 3-letter codenames and the three lock slots
  and notes and so\non. If you haven't seen anything of the kind... keep solving those
  locks!)\n\nScoring is always relative - each player has a score relative to each
  other\nplayer. That score is the number of the second player's lock slots to which\nthe
  first player has access, minus the number of the first player's lock slots\nto which
  the second player has access.\n\nA player accesses a lock slot when one of the following
  holds\n    * the player has solved the lock in the slot, and declared the solution;\n
  \   * the player has read three notes on the lock in the slot;\n    * there's no
  lock in the slot, and the player has accessed all the slots\n\twhich do have locks
  in them.\n\nA player reads every note in every lock the player accesses. When a
  lock is\nreplaced ('retired'), each note secured by the lock becomes 'public', and
  is\nread by every player.\n\nNote this means that once three notes on a lock become
  public, every player\naccesses the lock. The lock is then 'public' (and its owner
  should replace\nit!).\n\nTo declare a solution, you must secure a note on it behind
  a non-public lock\nin one of your three lock slots. Once the note is placed, it
  can't be moved.\n\n\n## Full details of the game mechanics\nSprings are directed;
  one of the blocks it is connected to is the 'root', the\nother the 'end'. A block
  is stationary if it is not the end of any spring. The\ndirected graph whose nodes
  are the blocks and whose edges are the springs is\nrequired to be acyclic. A spring
  may also be rooted in a pivot.\n\nI will now attempt to describe in full excruciating
  detail the game physics,\ni.e. the algorithm used to determine what happens on a
  turn. You shouldn't\nneed to read this to play the game! Experimenting and turning
  on blockage\nannotations should be enough.\n\nThe following description corresponds
  to the code in Physics.hs. The algorithm\nis the result of an extended process of
  experiment and iterated\nsimplification; see notes/game in the source distribution
  if you're perverse\nenough to want to read a scattered stream-of-consciousness account
  of the\nprocess.\n\nEach turn is separated into two phases. In the first phase,
  the forces arising\nfrom the player's move are 'resolved', possibly resulting in
  some movement. In\nthe second phase, forces arising from stretched or compressed
  springs are\nresolved, possibly resulting in some movement.\n\nHere we abuse physics
  terminology, and use the term 'force' to refer to either\na directional force in
  the usual sense, which we call a 'push', or a\nrotational force, which we call a
  'torque'. A force is always on a piece, in\nsome direction. Only the obvious six
  hex directions and the two obvious\nrotational directions occur; the magnitude is
  always 1. \n\nPlayer moves result in forces on the tools in the obvious way. A wrench
  which\nis moving gets a push in that direction each turn (sorry, Newton!). A spring\nwhich
  is not at its relaxed length results in a push on the end piece.\n\nTo _resolve_
  these initial forces:\n    * each initial force is 'propagated to a force group'\n
  \   * if a group is 'inconsistent' with another group: if one of the group is\n\t'dominated'
  by the other, it is 'blocked'; else both are blocked\n    * each force in each unblocked
  force group is 'applied'\n\nTo _apply_ a push: move the piece in the given direction.\nTo
  _apply_ a torque: rotate the piece in the given direction.\n\nTo _propagate_ a force:\n
  \   * If applying the force would result in an overlap with another piece,\n\tpush
  that piece - but if it's an arm, twist the pivot instead when\n\tthat makes sense.\n
  \   * If the force is a torque and an arm is pushing on another piece, we have\n\ta
  special rule: if the obvious push ends up propagating to a resisted\n\tforce (see
  below), then it is replaced with a 'clawing' push. e.g. in\n\tthe following situation:\n\t
  \   \\ O #\n\t     o\n\tif the pivot is twisted clockwise, the ball will first be
  pushed east,\n\tbut when that force propagates to a push on the stationary block
  to\n\tits east which is resisted, processing will back up and a push on the\n\tball
  southeast will be tried instead.\n    * A spring connecting two blocks transmits
  a push on one block to the\n\tother unless the direction is such that the push is
  tending to\n        compress resp. extend the spring and the spring is currently
  extended \n        resp. compressed, or the force is a player force and the spring
  isn't \n        already fully compressed resp. extended.\n\nA force is _resisted_
  if it is a push on a pivot or on a block which isn't the\n    end of a spring, or
  it's a torque on a block, or it's a force on a hook\n    which isn't already getting
  that force this phase as the result of a\n    player move, or it's a force on a
  wrench which isn't a push in the\n    direction it's already moving.\n\nTo _propagate
  an initial force to a force group_:\n    * Propagate the force as above, then recursively
  propagate the resulting\n\tforces, checking for resistance as we go. The force group
  consists of\n\tall the resulting propagated forces.\n    * On resistance: back up
  to try clawing as described above if appropriate,\n\telse consider the whole force
  group resisted - so the resulting force\n\tgroup is empty.\n\nTwo forces are _inconsistent_
  when\n    * they act on the same piece in different directions, or\n    * applying
  both at once results in overlapping pieces, or\n    * applying both at once results
  in an overextended/overcompressed spring.\n\nTwo force groups are _inconsistent_
  iff there is some force from the first\n    which is inconsistent with some force
  from the second.\n\nA force group _dominates_ another iff their initial forces are
  spring forces,\n    and the root of the first spring is an ancestor of the root
  of the second\n    spring, where an ancestor of a block B is recursively defined
  to be a block\n    which is the root of a spring which ends at B, or an ancestor
  of such a\n    block.\n\n-- mbays@sdf.org 2013\n"
