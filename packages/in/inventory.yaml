  # Inventory

  This is a utility that provides a variety of statistics about your Haskell
  project. These include:

  - A list of type signatures that are shared among multiple locally defined
    functions, enumerating those functions along with their definition sites.
  - Lists of the most used and least used definitions in the project.
  - A breakdown of local definitions, telling you the number of each type of
    definition as well as how many lines of code they take up.

  ## Using inventory

  Install with `stack update && stack install inventory` or `cabal update &&
  cabal install inventory`.

  Inventory uses `.hie` files to gather information about all haskell files in
  the project. Once you have generated `.hie` files for your project, execute
  `inventory` from your project's root.

  ## How to generate `.hie` files
  ### Cabal

  Add this to your `cabal.project.local` file:

  ```
  package *
    ghc-options: -fwrite-ide-info -hiedir=.hie
  ```

  Then do a full rebuild of the project:

  ```
  cabal clean
  cabal build all
  ```

  ### Stack

  Add this to your `stack.yaml` file:

  ```
  ghc-options:
    "$locals": -fwrite-ide-info
               -hiedir=.hie
  ```

  Then do a full rebuild:

  ```
  stack clean
  stack build
  ```

  By default `inventory` looks for HIE files in the `.hie` directory. You can
  override this using the `HIE_DIR` environment variable: `HIE_DIR=path/to/dir
  inventory`.

  ## Examples

  Here are some excerpts of the output that was produced by running `inventory`
  on the `stack` codebase:

  ### Definition counts
  ![Definiton counts image](images/defcounts.png)

  ### Most used definitions
  ![Most used image](images/mostused.png)

  ### Matching type signatures
  ![Equivalent signatures image](images/dupesigs.png)

  The output for matching signatures can be useful for discovering functions that
  are duplicates of one another. For instance, the `packageIdent` and
  `packageIdentifier` functions in the above output turned out to be duplicates.

  ### Known Issues/Limitations
  - Context such as constraints and foralls do not appear in the printed type
    signatures for GHC versions less than 9.0.1.
  - Standalone kind signatures are not yet included in definition counts.
  - Does not unfold type synonyms when comparing type signatures.
  - GHC versions other than 8.8, 8.10, and 9.0 are not currently supported.
  - You may encounter errors if the version of GHC used to compile `inventory` is
    different from the version used to compile your project.
