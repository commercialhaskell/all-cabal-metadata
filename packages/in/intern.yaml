synopsis: Efficient hash-consing for arbitrary data types
changelog: |
  0.9.2
  -----
  * Add a `Semigroup IntSet` instance.

  0.9
  ---
  * Removed `identity` from the Interned class, to support applications where the identity is obtained by other means (e.g. a unique Ptr value)

  0.8
  ---
  * Disabled cache removal as it was causing problems on large data sets. There is no good way to ensure that both references remain alive long enough to finish comparisons.
  * Switched to IORef from MVar

  0.7
  ---
  * Fixed problem where comparisons could happen between data structures while one was still a thunk, leading to equal structures comparing as inequal in limited circumstances, by appropriately using strictness annotations.

  0.6
  ---
  * Widened the caches so they don't go through a single MVar per type. This has made a dramatic impact on performance. However, this broke the previous invariant that newer entries always had higher Ids than older entries.

  0.5.2
  -----
  * Added Data.Interned.IntSet
