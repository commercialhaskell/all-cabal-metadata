  # Revision history for interval-patterns

  ## 0.1.0.0 - 2022-05-19

  * constructors behave more intuitively
    * if the endpoints are equal, it becomes a closed interval
    * when endpoints are reversed, using a smart constructor preserves the declared endpoint boundaries
      (e.g. `6 :|>: 4` becomes `4 :<|: 6`)
  * tests

  ## 0.0.11.0 - 2022-03-08

  * drop `Data.Suspension` entirely in favour of `Algebra.Lattice.Levitated`
  * rename `Data.Interval.{Set => Borel}` and add Lattice/Ring/Heyting instances
  * explicit exports for `Data.OneOrTwo`

  ## 0.0.10.2 -- 2022-02-22

  * fix `Enum` for `Suspension`

  ## 0.0.10.1 -- 2022-02-15

  * add `Layers.remove` and `Layers.baseline`

  ## 0.0.10.0 -- 2022-02-15

  * add dependency `group-theory`
  * `instance Monoid Suspension` now lifts monoids only
  * add `instance Group x => Group (Suspension x)`
  * `Data.Interval.unions` now sorts the list first; add `unionsAsc`
  * `Covering.unionsSet` uses `from/toAscList` and `unionsAsc`
  * `instance Group y => Group (Layers x y)`
  * `instance Functor Layers`
  * `nesting` now sorts the list first; add `nestingAsc`
  * `Semigroup Layers` uses `nestingAsc`

  ## 0.0.9.0 -- 2022-02-15

  * `Layers` is now a two-parameter type, and `nestings` supports arbitrary
    semigroups instead of the previous restriction to `Int`.
  * drop `multiset` dependency as a result
  * `type Event = Layers UTCTime (Sum Int)`

  ## 0.0.8.0 -- 2022-02-15

  * switch definitions of `lower` and `lowerBound`, `upper` and `upperBound`
  * universal `Bounded` and lifted `Enum` for Suspension
  * `(Data.Interval.\\)`
  * change names from `IntervalSet -> Covering` and `IntervalLayer -> Layers`
  * rename `Covering.intervals` to `Covering.covering` ("smart constructor")

  ## 0.0.7.1 -- 2022-02-13

  * `imapS` and `itraverseS`

  ## 0.0.7.0 -- 2022-02-13

  * introduce strictness annotations for `Suspension`, `Interval`, and `Adjacency`

  ## 0.0.6.1 -- 2022-02-13

  * fix `Num` instance for `Suspension`

  ## 0.0.6.0 -- 2022-02-13

  * remove `AdjacencyRepr` (don't need a type parameter you're just gonna hide)
  * amalgamate `split` into `adjacency`
  * no need for weird import chain, define everything in `Data.Interval`

  ## 0.0.5.0 -- 2022-02-12

  * `Data.Interval.Layered` provides a monoid like `IntervalSet`, but
    that will keep track of the number of times a particular interval
    has been added to the structure. This is useful for determining, e.g.,
    how many clones you need to attend all today's meetings on time.

  ## 0.0.4.0 -- 2022-02-12

  * Rename project

  # Revision history for timeframes

  ## 0.0.3.0 -- 2022-02-12

  * Drop `orient`, putting `Ord` constraints on the constructors of `Interval`
    and leaving the ordering to the smart constructors
  * Rewrite `intersection`, `union`, and `difference` using `split`
  * Settle on changelog format
  * move `withBounds` to `Data.Interval`

  ## 0.0.2.0 -- 2022-02-12

  * Drop `UpToThree` in favour of a more dependently-typed model of adjacency
  * `Overlap` is changed to `Adjacency` where it occurs
  * `split` now returns `SomeAdjacency`, which can be pattern-matched to yield
    the exact (one, two, or three) intervals into which the two have been cleaved
  * `Interval` moved into `Data.Interval.Types` to avoid a cyclic dependency
    between `Data.Interval` and `Data.Interval.Adjacency`

  ## 0.0.1.0 -- 2022-02-08

  Types and functions for working with intervals and their monoid under union.

  * `Data.Suspension` provides the two-point extension of a type,
    used for marking the endpoints of intervals.
  * `Data.Interval` defines the `Interval` type, along with type- and value-level
    structures for working with closed and open endpoints.
  * `overlap` calculates the relationship between intervals
    according to Allen`s interval algebra.
  * `split` separates two intervals into one, two, or three parts,
    depending on their overlap.
