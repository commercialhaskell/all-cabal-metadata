  GuiTV is a small library for GUI-style visualizing functional values.  It
  can also be viewed as an approach to functional GUIs.  It is implemented
  very simply by using Phooey (http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/phooey) in the
  TV framework (http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/TV).  For a fuller
  description and link to documentation, please see the project wiki page:

    http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/GuiTV

  You can configure, build, generate haddock docs, and install all in the
  usual way with Cabal commands.

    runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
    runhaskell Setup.lhs build
    runhaskell Setup.lhs install

  See src/Examples.hs for examples.
