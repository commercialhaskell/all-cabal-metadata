description: |-
  Attempto Controlled English is a formally defined unambiguous language which
  is a subset of the English language. This package provides a tokenizer,
  parser and printer for that language. Specifically, it implements the
  declarative mood and the interrogative mood.
  The imperative mood is omitted at this time. Interpretation rules,
  conversion to FoL, or any further analysis is not implemented by this
  library.
