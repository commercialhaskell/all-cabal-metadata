description: ! '@Data.Array.Accelerate@ defines an embedded array language for computations

  for high-performance computing in Haskell. Computations on multi-dimensional,

  regular arrays are expressed in the form of parameterised collective

  operations, such as maps, reductions, and permutations. These computations may

  then be online compiled and executed on a range of architectures.


  [/A simple example/]


  As a simple example, consider the computation of a dot product of two vectors

  of floating point numbers:


  > dotp :: Acc (Vector Float) -> Acc (Vector Float) -> Acc (Scalar Float)

  > dotp xs ys = fold (+) 0 (zipWith (*) xs ys)


  Except for the type, this code is almost the same as the corresponding Haskell

  code on lists of floats. The types indicate that the computation may be

  online-compiled for performance - for example, using

  @Data.Array.Accelerate.CUDA@ it may be on-the-fly off-loaded to the GPU.


  [/Available backends/]


  Currently, there are two backends:


  1. An interpreter that serves as a reference implementation of the intended

  semantics of the language, which is included in this package.


  2. A CUDA backend generating code for CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPUs:

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/accelerate-cuda>


  Several experimental and/or incomplete backends also exist. If you are

  particularly interested in any of these, especially with helping to finish

  them, please contact us.


  1. Cilk\/ICC and OpenCL: <https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate-backend-kit>


  2. Another OpenCL backend: <https://github.com/HIPERFIT/accelerate-opencl>


  3. A backend to the Repa array library: <https://github.com/blambo/accelerate-repa>


  4. An infrastructure for generating LLVM code, with backends targeting

  multicore CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs: <https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate-llvm/>


  [/Additional components/]


  The following support packages are available:


  1. @accelerate-cuda@: A high-performance parallel backend targeting

  CUDA-enabled NVIDIA GPUs. Requires the NVIDIA CUDA SDK and, for full

  functionality, hardware with compute capability 1.1 or greater. See the

  table on Wikipedia for supported GPUs:

  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#Supported_GPUs>


  2. @accelerate-examples@: Computational kernels and applications showcasing

  /Accelerate/, as well as performance and regression tests.


  3. @accelerate-io@: Fast conversion between /Accelerate/ arrays and other

  formats, including ''vector'' and ''repa''.


  4. @accelerate-fft@: Computation of Discrete Fourier Transforms.


  Install them from Hackage with @cabal install PACKAGE@


  [/Examples and documentation/]


  Haddock documentation is included in the package, and a tutorial is available

  on the GitHub wiki: <https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate/wiki>


  The @accelerate-examples@ package demonstrates a range of computational

  kernels and several complete applications, including:


  * An implementation of the Canny edge detection algorithm


  * An interactive Mandelbrot set generator


  * A particle-based simulation of stable fluid flows


  * An /n/-body simulation of gravitational attraction between solid particles


  * A cellular automata simulation


  * A \"password recovery\" tool, for dictionary lookup of MD5 hashes


  * A simple interactive ray tracer


  [/Mailing list and contacts/]


  * Mailing list: <accelerate-haskell@googlegroups.com> (discussion of both

  use and development welcome).


  * Sign up for the mailing list here:

  <http://groups.google.com/group/accelerate-haskell>


  * Bug reports and issue tracking:

  <https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate/issues>


  [/Hackage note/]


  The module documentation list generated by Hackage is incorrect. The only

  exposed modules should be:


  * "Data.Array.Accelerate"


  * "Data.Array.Accelerate.Interpreter"


  * "Data.Array.Accelerate.Data.Complex"
