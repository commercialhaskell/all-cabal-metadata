description: ! 'This Haskell library implements several small vectors types

  with @Double@ fields, with seperate types for each size of

  vector, and a type class for handling vectors generally.

  (Note that although this package is listed in the \"graphics\"

  category, the package itself has no graphics facilities. It

  just contains data structures that are useful for graphics

  work.)


  Changes:


  * Fixed a stupid bug in @union@. Until now, the function could

  sometimes return gibberish answers. Hopefully this is now fixed.'
