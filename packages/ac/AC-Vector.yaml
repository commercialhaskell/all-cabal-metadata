description: |-
  This Haskell library implements several small vectors types with @Double@
  fields, with seperate types for each size of vector, and a type class for
  handling vectors generally. (Note that although this package is listed in the
  \"graphics\" category, the package itself has no graphics facilities. It just
  contains data structures that are useful for graphics work.)
