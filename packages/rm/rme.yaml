  # Revision history for rme

  ## 0.1.2 -- 2026-01-26

  * Added partial support for arrays returned from symbolic functions.
    Expressions must be exactly of the form: `select (f args) ix`. This is
    used to support the translation of uninterpreted functions new in
    SAW.

  * Added support for concrete integers as needed for SAW's above translation
    used to index the symbolic array results.

  ## 0.1.1

  * Added `Ord` instance for `RME`

  ## 0.1

  * First version.
