description: |-
  Takusen-Oracle is a Oracle access library. Like HSQL and HDBC, we support
  arbitrary SQL statements (currently strings, extensible to anything
  that can be converted to a string).
  It is based on original Takusen library. It was just upgraded to support
  Oracle 11gR2/12c instant client and GHC 7.4.2 and higher.
