synopsis: Tax types and computations for Australia
changelog: |
  ## Version 2023.2

  - Add support for PAYG Instalments, which are specified in aggregate
    as a refundable tax offset via the `paygInstalments` field.

  - Add the `Deductions` type, which expresses the various deduction
    types, as well as the (aggregate) amount of deductions related to
    foreign income.

  - Implement the Foreign Income Tax Offset Limit.  The limit will be
    calculated and the `foreignTaxOffset` field in the `TaxReturnInfo`
    will be clamped to it.
