  This package provides a fancy test runner and support for «golden testing».
  A golden test is an IO action that writes its result to a file.
  To pass the test, this output file should be identical to the corresponding
  «golden» file, which contains the correct result for the test.
  The test runner allows filtering tests using regexes, and to interactively
  inspect the result of golden tests.
  This package is a heavily extended fork of tasty-golden.
