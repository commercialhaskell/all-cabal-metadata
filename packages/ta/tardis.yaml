    2024-01-15: Removed MonadTrans instance, replaced with liftTardisT

changelog-type: markdown
description: "# TardisT\n\n![build status](https://github.com/DanBurton/tardis/actions/workflows/haskell.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)\n\nThe
  State monad allows you\nto send information forwards to the future,\nor to receive
  such information from the past.\nThe Reverse State monad allows you to do the reverse:\nsend
  information backwards to the past,\nor receive information from the future. \n\nTardisT
  is a monad transformer\nthat provides state operations that allow you\nto send information
  to both the future *and* the past,\nas well as receive information from both directions.\nIt
  is isomorphic to a StateT on top of a ReverseStateT,\nor vice-versa.\n\nSee test/Example.hs
  for an example.\n\n----\n\nThis was inspired by Luke Palmer's blog post on\nthe
  \"reverse state monad\".\n\nhttp://lukepalmer.wordpress.com/2008/08/10/mindfuck-the-reverse-state-monad/\n\nSee
