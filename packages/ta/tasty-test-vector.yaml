description: ! 'Many specifications provide test vectors for their algorithms, particularly

  specifications for cryptographic primatives. These are like QuickCheck properties

  in that they provide some function input and check the output, but unlike QuickCheck

  the inputs and expected results are predefined.


  This library provides an interface for cleanly integrating such test vectors into

  the ''tasty'' test framework.'
