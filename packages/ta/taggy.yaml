description: |-
  /taggy/ is a simple package for parsing HTML (and should work with XML)
  written on top of the <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/attoparsec attoparsec>
  library, which makes it one of the most efficient (space and time consumption wise)
  on hackage.

  This is the root module of /taggy/. It reexports everything
  from the package. See each module's docs for details about
  the functions and types involved in /taggy/.

  While we've been testing the parser on /many/ pages, it may still
  be a bit rough around the edges. Let us know on <http://github.com/alpmestan/taggy/issues github>
  if you have any problem.

  If you like to look at your HTML through
  various optical instruments, feel free to take a look at
  the companion <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/taggy-lens taggy-lens>
  package we've put up together. It makes HTML parsing a piece of cake.

  If you want to parse a document as list of tags
  and go through it as some kind of stream by just picking
  what you need, head to "Text.Taggy.Parser" and take
  a look at 'Text.Taggy.Parser.taggyWith' and
  'Text.Taggy.Parser.run'.

  If you want to parse the document as a DOM tree and
  traverse it to find the information you need,
  use 'Text.Taggy.DOM.parseDOM'. This is especially useful
  when used in conjunction with <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/taggy-lens taggy-lens>.

  If you build some HTML manually
  or just transform some existing DOM tree
  and want to turn it into a 'Data.Text.Lazy.Text'
  head to "Text.Taggy.Renderer" and look at 'Text.Taggy.Renderer.render'.
