description: ! '/taggy/ is a simple package for parsing HTML (and should work with
  XML)

  written on top of the <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/attoparsec attoparsec>

  library, which makes it one of the most efficient (space and time consumption wise)

  on hackage.


  This is the root module of /taggy/. It reexports everything

  from the package. See each module''s docs for details about

  the functions and types involved in /taggy/.


  While we''ve been testing the parser on /many/ pages, it may still

  be a bit rough around the edges. Let us know on <http://github.com/alpmestan/taggy/issues
  github>

  if you have any problem.


  If you like to look at your HTML through

  various optical instruments, feel free to take a look at

  the companion <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/taggy-lens taggy-lens>

  package we''ve put up together. It makes HTML parsing a piece of cake.


  If you want to parse a document as list of tags

  and go through it as some kind of stream by just picking

  what you need, head to "Text.Taggy.Parser" and take

  a look at ''Text.Taggy.Parser.taggyWith'' and

  ''Text.Taggy.Parser.run''.


  If you want to parse the document as a DOM tree and

  traverse it to find the information you need,

  use ''Text.Taggy.DOM.parseDOM''. This is especially useful

  when used in conjunction with <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/taggy-lens taggy-lens>.


  If you build some HTML manually

  or just transform some existing DOM tree

  and want to turn it into a ''Data.Text.Lazy.Text''

  head to "Text.Taggy.Renderer" and look at ''Text.Taggy.Renderer.render''.'
