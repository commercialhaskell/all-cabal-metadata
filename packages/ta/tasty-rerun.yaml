changelog: |
  # 1.1.19

  * Support tasty 1.5.

  # 1.1.18

  * Support tasty 1.4.

  # 1.1.17

  * Add `defaultMainWithRerun`,
    a drop-in replacement for `defaultMain`.

  # 1.1.16

  * New command-line option `--rerun-all-on-success`.
  * New command-line shortcut `--rerun`.

  # 1.1.15

  * Bump upper bound of base.
  * Restore missing -j command-line option.

  # 1.1.14

  * Support tasty 1.2.

  # 1.1.13

  * Bump upper bound of base.

  # 1.1.12

  * Bump upper bound of tasty.

  # 1.1.11

  * Bump upper bound of base.

  # 1.1.10

  * Bump upper bound of tasty.

  # 1.1.9

  * Bump upper bound of tasty.

  # 1.1.8

  * Bump upper bound of tasty.

  # 1.1.7

  * Allow base < 4.11.

  # 1.1.6

  * Allow base 4.9 for building with GHC 8.0

  # 1.1.5

  * Supports tasty < 0.12.

  # 1.1.4

  * Supports base <= 4.9, tagged <= 0.9

  # 1.1.3

  * Supports tasty =< 0.11

  # 1.1.2

  * Allow base 4.7 for building with GHC 7.8

  # 1.1.1

  * Update to work with tasty >= 0.8

  # 1.1.0

  * The `TestTree` is filtered using a custom traversal now, rather than a
    `TreeFold`. This gives better guarantees that the `TestTree` is only
    reduced and that nodes (such as `WithResources`) continue to work. The
    resulting filtered `TestTree` now has the same shape as the original
    tree, but filtered tests are transformed into `TestGroup`s with no tests.
    This is a fairly major change to how the filtering is performed, so this
    is a new major release, and previous versions are now considered
    deprecated.

  # 1.0.1

  * Now supports filtering `TestTree`s that use resources.

  # 1.0.0

  * Initial release. Supports the `--rerun-update`, `--rerun-log-file` and
    `--rerun-filter` options. Supported filters are `new`, `failures`,
    `exceptions` and `successful`.

  # tasty-rerun

  This `Ingredient` for [`tasty`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty) testing framework
  allows to filter a test tree depending
  on an outcome of the previous run.
  This may be useful in many scenarios,
  especially when a test suite grows large.

  For example, `tasty-rerun` allows:

  * Rerun only tests, which failed during the last run (`--rerun`).
    Combined with live reloading (e. g., using `ghcid` or `stack test --file-watch`),
    it gives an ultimate power to focus on broken parts
    and put them back in shape, enjoying a tight feedback loop.
  * Rerun only tests, which have beed added since the last saved test run.
    This comes handy when writing a new module, which does not affect other
    parts of the system, or adding new test cases.
  * Rerun only tests, which passed during the last saved test run.
    Sometimes a part of the test suite is consistently failing
    (e. g., an external service is temporarily down), but you want be sure
    that you are not breaking anything else in course of your work.

  To add it to your test suite just replace `Test.Tasty.defaultMain`
  with `Test.Tasty.Ingredients.Rerun.defaultMainWithRerun`:

  ```haskell
  import Test.Tasty
  import Test.Tasty.Ingredients.Rerun

  main :: IO ()
  main = defaultMainWithRerun tests

  tests :: TestTree
  tests = undefined
  ```

  Use `--help` to list command-line options:

  * `--rerun`

    Rerun only tests, which failed during the last run.
    If the last run was successful, execute a full test
    suite afresh. A shortcut for `--rerun-update
    --rerun-filter failures,exceptions
    --rerun-all-on-success`.

  * `--rerun-update`

    Update the log file to reflect latest test outcomes.

  * `--rerun-filter CATEGORIES`

    Read the log file and rerun only tests from a given
    comma-separated list of categories: `failures`,
    `exceptions`, `new`, `successful`. If this option is
    omitted or the log file is missing, rerun everything.

  * `--rerun-all-on-success`

    If according to the log file and `--rerun-filter` there
    is nothing left to rerun, run all tests. This comes
    especially handy in `stack test --file-watch` or
    `ghcid` scenarios.

  * `--rerun-log-file FILE`

    Location of the log file (default: `.tasty-rerun-log`).
