description: |-
  Tak is a new abstract strategy game, devised by James Earnest (of Cheapass
  Games), and Patrick Rothfuss, author of The Wise Man's Fear, where the game of
  Tak was first mentioned.
  This is a library which encodes the rules of Tak, provides a client for the
  popular playtak.com server, and contributes an AI tak bot for the same server.
  This package provides 3 top level modules:
  Tak encodes the rules of Tak, as a game tree, containing all possible moves.
  This tree is extremely large, so be careful not to strictly evaluate it!
  PlayTak provides functions for maintaining a connection to playtak.com, receiving
  messages, and sending commands. This could be used to implement a
  fully-fledged game client, or a playtak.com bot.
  PlayTakBot is a framework to make it easy to build a playtak.com bot. It will
  maintain a connection, seek games, and create a game tree. The bot implementor
  just needs to provide functions to evaluate a game state, and choose the next
  play from each game state.
