  # takedouble
  TakeDouble is a duplicate file finder that reads and checks the filesize and first 4k and last 4k of a file and only then checks the full file to find duplicates.

  # How do I make it go?
  You can use nix or cabal to build this.

  `cabal build` should produce a binary. (use [ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) to install cabal and the latest GHC version).

  After that, `takedouble <dirname>` so you could use `takedouble ~/` for example.

  If there are common files you'd like to exclude (such as .git directories) you can pass a glob to exclude any matching patterns from the output.

  For example

  `takedouble <dirname> "**/.git/**"`

  # Is it Fast?

  On my ThinkPad with six Xeon cores, 128GB RAM, and a 1TB Samsung 970 Pro NVMe (via PCIe 3.0), I can check 34393 uncached files in 6.4 seconds.
  A second run on the same directory takes 2.8 seconds due to file metainfo cached in memory.
