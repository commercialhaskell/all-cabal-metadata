  Fix compatibility with GHC 8.6

  Version 1.1.0.2
  ---------------

  Fix a bug where some (mostly Asian) characters would break alignment in the

  Version 1.1.0.1
  ---------------

  Fix a bug where `-l` was still using `/` instead of `.` as a field separator

  Version 1.1
  -----------

  **NOTE**: This major release contains some breaking changes to the semantics of patterns.
  In the original pattern design I didn't notice the conflict between using `/` as
  a field separator and as the AWK syntax for pattern matching `/.../`.

  The new patterns have been around for a relatively short time (5 months), so
  hopefully the breakage won't be too big. I'm sorry about any problems caused by
  the change.

  See <https://github.com/feuerbach/tasty/issues/220> for the discussion.

  * The field separator in patterns is changed from slash (`/`) to period (`.`),
    and `.` is now allowed in raw patterns.

    The field separator is used to join the group names and the test
    name when comparing to a pattern such as `-p foo` or `-p /foo/`.

    If you used

        -p 'foo/bar'

    or

        -p '/foo\/bar/'

    before, now you should use

        -p 'foo.bar'
    or

        -p '/foo.bar/'

    if you meant "test/group `bar` inside group `foo`, or

        -p '/foo\/bar/'

    if you meant "test/group containing `foo/bar` in the name".

    The need for escaping the slash inside the `/.../` pattern was precisely the
    motivation for this change.

  * Raw patterns (ones that are not AWK expressions) may no longer contain slashes
    (`/`).

    So

        -p 'foo/bar'

    is no longer allowed, and

        -p '/foo/'

    is now parsed as an AWK expression `/foo/`, whereas before it
    was treated as a raw pattern and converted to `/\/foo\//`.

    The reason for this change is that `/foo/` is a valid AWK expression
    and should be parsed as such.

  * Raw patterns may now contain hyphens, so e.g. `-p type-checking` now works.

    In theory this makes some valid AWK expressions (such as `NF-2`) not to be
    parsed as such, but they are either unlikely to be useful or could also be
    expressed in other ways (`NF!=2`).

  * Several new exports, mostly for testing/debugging patterns:

    * `TestPattern` now has a `Show` instance; `TestPattern` and `Expr` now have
        `Eq` instances.
    * The constructors of `TestPattern` are now exported.
    * `parseAwkExpr` is introduced and can be used in ghci to see how an AWK
        expression is parsed. (For parsing test patterns, which include raw
        patterns in addition to AWK expression, use `parseTestPattern`.)

  Update to optparse-applicative 0.11

  Version 0.10
  ------------

  * Add the `--color` option
  * Timings
      * Introduce the `Time` type synonym
      * Change the types of `launchTestTree` and `TestReporter` to accept the
        total run time
      * `consoleTestReporter` now displays the timings

  Version 0.9.0.1
  ---------------

  Upgrade to optparse-applicative-0.10.

  Version 0.8.1.3
  ---------------

  Be careful not to export the `Show (a -> b)` instance, see
  <https://github.com/feuerbach/tasty/issues/71>

  Version 0.8.1.2
  ---------------

  Hide cursor when running tests

  Version 0.8.1.1
  ---------------

  Fix for GHC 7.9

  Version 0.8.0.4
  ---------------

  Remove the old 'colors' flag description from the cabal file

  Version 0.8.0.2
  ---------------

  Make ansi-terminal an unconditional dependency

  Version 0.8
  -----------

  * `Test.Tasty.Ingredients` is now exposed
  * `Test.Tasty.Ingredients.Basic` is added, which exports the ingredients defined
      in the `tasty` package. These exports should now be used instead of ones
      exported from `Test.Tasty.Runners`
  * The `Result` type is now structured a bit differently. Providers now should
    use `testPassed` and `testFailed` functions instead of constructing `Result`s
    directly.
  * Add «quiet mode» (see README)
  * Add «hide successes» mode (see README)
  * Add short command-line options: `-j` for `--num-threads`, `-p` for `--pattern`
  * Add timeout support
  * `AppMonoid` is renamed to `Traversal` for consistency with the 'reducers'
    package. Another similar wrapper, `Ap`, is introduced.
  * Fix a resources bug (resources were not released if the test suite was
    interrupted)
  * The type of `launchTestTree` is changed. It now takes a continuation as an
    argument. This is necessary to fix the bug mentioned above.
  * Add `flagCLParser` to be used as the `optionCLParser` implementation for
    boolean options.
  * Add the ability to pass options via environment

  Version 0.7
  -----------

  * Use `regex-tdfa` instead of `regex-posix` (which is a native
    implementation, and as such is more portable)
  * `foldTestTree` now takes the algebra in the form of a record rather than
    multiple arguments, to minimize breakage when new nodes are added or
    existing ones change
  * `withResource` now passes the IO action to get the resource to the inner test tree

  Version 0.6
  -----------

  * Better handling of exceptions that arise during resource creation or
    disposal
  * Expose the `AppMonoid` wrapper
  * Add `askOption` and `inludingOptions`

  Version 0.5.2.1
  ---------------

  Depend on ansi-terminal >= 0.6.1. This fixes some issues with colors on Windows.

  Version 0.5.2
  -------------

  * Export `Result` and `Progress` from `Test.Tasty.Runners`
  * Make it clear that only GHC 7.4+ is supported

  Version 0.5.1
  -------------

  Export `ResourceSpec` from `Test.Tasty.Runners`

  Version 0.5
  -----------

  Add a capability to acquire and release resources. See the «Resources» section
  in the `Test.Tasty` docs.

  For the end users, the API is backwards-compatible.

  Test runners may have to be adjusted — there is a new constructor of `TestTree`
  and a new argument of `foldTestTree`.

  Version 0.4.2
  -------------

  Add `defaultIngredients`

  Version 0.4.1.1
  ---------------

  Print the failure description in red

  Version 0.4.0.1
  ---------------

  Fix a bug ([#25](https://github.com/feuerbach/tasty/issues/25))

  Version 0.4
  -----------

  The big change in this release is introduction of ingredients, which is a
  replacement for runners. But unless you have a custom runner, this is unlikely
  to affect you much.

  The `Ingredient` data type has replaced the `Runner` type.

  The following functions have been renamed and possibly changed their types:

  * `defaultMainWithRunner` → `defaultMainWithIngredients`
  * `treeOptionParser` → `suiteOptionParser`
  * `getTreeOptions` → `treeOptions`
  * `runUI` → `consoleTestReporter`

  Added in this release:

  * `suiteOptions`
  * `optionParser`
  * functions operating on ingredients
  * `testsNames`
  * the `listingTests` ingredient and its option, `ListTests`

  `NumThreads` is no longer a core option, but is automatically included in the
  test reporting ingredients (see its haddock).

  Version 0.3.1
  -------------

  * Proper reporting of (some) non-terminating tests (#15)
  * Upgrade to optparse-applicative 0.6

  Version 0.3
  -----------

  * Restrict dependency versions
  * Fix a bug where non-terminating test would lead to a deadlock (#15)

  Version 0.2
  -----------

  * Add an `execRunner` function
  * Make `Runner` return `IO Bool`

  Version 0.1.1
  -------------

  # Tasty

  **Tasty** is a modern testing framework for Haskell.

  It lets you combine your unit tests, golden tests, QuickCheck/SmallCheck
  properties, and any other types of tests into a single test suite.

  Features:

  * Run tests in parallel but report results in a deterministic order
  * Filter the tests to be run using patterns specified on the command line
  * Hierarchical, colored display of test results
  * Reporting of test statistics
  * Acquire and release resources (sockets, temporary files etc.) that can be
    shared among several tests
  * Extensibility: add your own test providers and ingredients (runners) above and
    beyond those provided

  To find out what's new, read the **[change log][]**.

  [change log]: https://github.com/feuerbach/tasty/blob/master/core/CHANGELOG.md

  ## Example

  Here's how your `test.hs` might look like:

  ```haskell
  import Test.Tasty
  import Test.Tasty.SmallCheck as SC
  import Test.Tasty.QuickCheck as QC
  import Test.Tasty.HUnit

  import Data.List
  import Data.Ord

  main = defaultMain tests

  tests :: TestTree
  tests = testGroup "Tests" [properties, unitTests]

  properties :: TestTree
  properties = testGroup "Properties" [scProps, qcProps]

  scProps = testGroup "(checked by SmallCheck)"
    [ SC.testProperty "sort == sort . reverse" $
        \list -> sort (list :: [Int]) == sort (reverse list)
    , SC.testProperty "Fermat's little theorem" $
        \x -> ((x :: Integer)^7 - x) `mod` 7 == 0
    -- the following property does not hold
    , SC.testProperty "Fermat's last theorem" $
        \x y z n ->
          (n :: Integer) >= 3 SC.==> x^n + y^n /= (z^n :: Integer)
    ]

  qcProps = testGroup "(checked by QuickCheck)"
    [ QC.testProperty "sort == sort . reverse" $
        \list -> sort (list :: [Int]) == sort (reverse list)
    , QC.testProperty "Fermat's little theorem" $
        \x -> ((x :: Integer)^7 - x) `mod` 7 == 0
    -- the following property does not hold
    , QC.testProperty "Fermat's last theorem" $
        \x y z n ->
          (n :: Integer) >= 3 QC.==> x^n + y^n /= (z^n :: Integer)
    ]

  unitTests = testGroup "Unit tests"
    [ testCase "List comparison (different length)" $
        [1, 2, 3] `compare` [1,2] @?= GT

    -- the following test does not hold
    , testCase "List comparison (same length)" $
        [1, 2, 3] `compare` [1,2,2] @?= LT
    ]
  ```

  And here is the output of the above program:

  ![](https://raw.github.com/feuerbach/tasty/master/screenshot.png)

  (Note that whether QuickCheck finds a counterexample to the third property is
  determined by chance.)

  ## Packages

  [tasty][] is the core package. It contains basic definitions and APIs and a
  console runner.

  [tasty]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty

  In order to create a test suite, you also need to install one or more «providers» (see
  below).

  ### Providers

  The following providers exist:

  * [tasty-hunit](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-hunit) — for unit tests
    (based on [HUnit](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/HUnit))
  * [tasty-golden][] — for golden
    tests, which are unit tests whose results are kept in files
  * [tasty-smallcheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-smallcheck) —
    exhaustive property-based testing
    (based on [smallcheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/smallcheck))
  * [tasty-quickcheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-quickcheck) — for randomized
    property-based testing (based on [QuickCheck](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck))
  * [tasty-hedgehog](https://github.com/qfpl/tasty-hedgehog) — for randomized
    property-based testing (based on [Hedgehog](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedgehog))
  * [tasty-hspec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-hspec) — for
    [Hspec](https://hspec.github.io/) tests
  * [tasty-leancheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-leancheck) — for
    enumerative property-based testing
    (based on [LeanCheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/leancheck))
  * [tasty-program](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-program) — run
    external program and test whether it terminates successfully
  * [tasty-wai](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-wai) - for testing [wai](https://hackage.haskell.org/wai) endpoints.

  [tasty-golden]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-golden

  It's easy to create custom providers using the API from `Test.Tasty.Providers`.

  ### Ingredients

  Ingredients represent different actions that you can perform on your test suite.
  One obvious ingredient that you want to include is one that runs tests and
  reports the progress and results.

  Another standard ingredient is one that simply prints the names of all tests.

  It is possible to write custom ingredients using the API from `Test.Tasty.Runners`.

  Some ingredients that can enhance your test suite are:

  * [tasty-ant-xml](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-ant-xml) adds a
    possibility to write the test results in a machine-readable XML format, which
    is understood by various CI systems and IDEs
  * [tasty-rerun](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-rerun) adds support for
    minimal test reruns by recording previous test runs and using this information
    to filter the test tree. For example, you can use this ingredient to only run
    failed tests, or only run tests that threw an exception.
  * [tasty-html](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-html) adds the
    possibility to write the test results as a HTML file
  * [tasty-stats](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-stats) adds the
    possibility to collect statistics of the test suite in a CSV file.

  ### Other packages

  * [tasty-th](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-th) automatically
  discovers tests based on the function names and generate the boilerplate code for
  you
  * [tasty-hunit-adapter](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-hunit-adapter)
    converts existing HUnit test suites into tasty test suites
  * [tasty-discover](https://github.com/lwm/tasty-discover) automatically discovers
  your tests.
  * [tasty-expected-failure](https://github.com/nomeata/tasty-expected-failure) provides
  test markers for when you expect failures or wish to ignore tests.


  ## Options

  Options allow one to customize the run-time behavior of the test suite, such
  as:

  * mode of operation (run tests, list tests, run tests quietly etc.)
  * which tests are run (see «Patterns» below)
  * parameters of individual providers (like depth of search for SmallCheck)

  ### Setting options

  There are two main ways to set options:

  #### Runtime

  When using the standard console runner, the options can be passed on the
  command line or via environment variables. To see the available options, run
  your test suite with the `--help` flag. The output will look something like this
  (depending on which ingredients and providers the test suite uses):

  ```
  % ./test --help
  Mmm... tasty test suite

  Usage: test [-p|--pattern PATTERN] [-t|--timeout DURATION] [-l|--list-tests]
              [-j|--num-threads NUMBER] [-q|--quiet] [--hide-successes]
              [--color never|always|auto] [--quickcheck-tests NUMBER]
              [--quickcheck-replay SEED] [--quickcheck-show-replay]
              [--quickcheck-max-size NUMBER] [--quickcheck-max-ratio NUMBER]
              [--quickcheck-verbose] [--smallcheck-depth NUMBER]

  Available options:
    -h,--help                Show this help text
    -p,--pattern PATTERN     Select only tests which satisfy a pattern or awk
                             expression
    -t,--timeout DURATION    Timeout for individual tests (suffixes: ms,s,m,h;
                             default: s)
    -l,--list-tests          Do not run the tests; just print their names
    -j,--num-threads NUMBER  Number of threads to use for tests execution
    -q,--quiet               Do not produce any output; indicate success only by
                             the exit code
    --hide-successes         Do not print tests that passed successfully
    --color never|always|auto
                             When to use colored output (default: 'auto')
    --quickcheck-tests NUMBER
                             Number of test cases for QuickCheck to generate
    --quickcheck-replay SEED Random seed to use for replaying a previous test run
                             (use same --quickcheck-max-size)
    --quickcheck-show-replay Show a replay token for replaying tests
    --quickcheck-max-size NUMBER
                             Size of the biggest test cases quickcheck generates
    --quickcheck-max-ratio NUMBER
                             Maximum number of discared tests per successful test
                             before giving up
    --quickcheck-verbose     Show the generated test cases
    --smallcheck-depth NUMBER
                             Depth to use for smallcheck tests
  ```

  Every option can be passed via environment. To obtain the environment variable
  name from the option name, replace hyphens `-` with underscores `_`, capitalize
  all letters, and prepend `TASTY_`. For example, the environment equivalent of
  `--smallcheck-depth` is `TASTY_SMALLCHECK_DEPTH`.

  Note on boolean options: by convention, boolean ("on/off") options are specified
  using a switch on the command line, for example `--quickcheck-show-replay`
  instead of `--quickcheck-show-replay=true`. However, when
  passed via the environment, the option value needs to be `True` or `False`
  (case-insensitive), e.g. `TASTY_QUICKCHECK_SHOW_REPLAY=true`.

  If you're using a non-console runner, please refer to its documentation to find
  out how to configure options during the run time.

  #### Compile-time

  You can also specify options in the test suite itself, using
  `localOption`. It can be applied not only to the whole test tree, but also to
  individual tests or subgroups, so that different tests can be run with
  different options.

  It is possible to combine run-time and compile-time options, too, by using
  `adjustOption`. For example, make the overall testing depth configurable
  during the run time, but increase or decrease it slightly for individual
  tests.

  This method currently doesn't work for ingredient options, such as `--quiet` or
  `--num-threads`. You can set them by setting the corresponding environment
  variable before calling `defaultMain`:

  <a id="num_threads_example">

  ```haskell
  import Test.Tasty
  import System.Environment

  main = do
    setEnv "TASTY_NUM_THREADS" "1"
    defaultMain _
  ```

  ### Patterns

  It is possible to restrict the set of executed tests using the `-p/--pattern`
  option.

  Tasty patterns are very powerful, but if you just want to quickly run tests containing `foo`
  somewhere in their name or in the name of an enclosing test group, you can just
  pass `-p foo`. If you need more power, or if that didn't work as expected, read
  on.

  A pattern is an [awk expression][awk]. When the expression is evaluated, the field `$1`
  is set to the outermost test group name, `$2` is set to the next test group
  name, and so on up to `$NF`, which is set to the test's own name. The field `$0`
  is set to all other fields concatenated using `.` as a separator.

  [awk]: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/awk.html#tag_20_06_13_02

  As an example, consider a test inside two test groups:

  ```
    testGroup "One" [ testGroup "Two" [ testCase "Three" _ ] ]
  ```

  When a pattern is evaluated for the above test case, the available fields and variables are:

      $0 = "One.Two.Three"
      $1 = "One"
      $2 = "Two"
      $3 = "Three"
      NF = 3

  Here are some examples of awk expressions accepted as patterns:

  * `$2 == "Two"` — select the subgroup `Two`
  * `$2 == "Two" && $3 == "Three"`  — select the test or subgroup named `Three` in the subgroup named `Two`
  * `$2 == "Two" || $2 == "Twenty-two"` — select two subgroups
  * `$0 !~ /skip/` or `! /skip/` — select tests whose full names (including group names) do not contain the word `skip`
  * `$NF !~ /skip/` — select tests whose own names (but not group names) do not contain the word `skip`
  * `$(NF-1) ~ /QuickCheck/` — select tests whose immediate parent group name
      contains `QuickCheck`

  As an extension to the awk expression language, if a pattern `pat` contains only
  letters, digits, and characters from the set `._ -` (period, underscore, space, hyphen),
  it is treated like `/pat/` (and therefore matched against `$0`).
  This is so that we can use `-p foo` as a shortcut for `-p /foo/`.

  The only deviation from awk that you will likely notice is that Tasty
  does not implement regular expression matching.
  Instead, `$1 ~ /foo/` means that the string `foo` occurs somewhere in `$1`,
  case-sensitively. We want to avoid a heavy dependency of `regex-tdfa` or
  similar libraries; however, if there is demand, regular expression support could
  be added under a cabal flag.

  The following built-in functions are supported:

  ```
  substr(s, m[, n])
  ```
  Return the at most `n`-character substring of `s` that begins at
  position `m`, numbering from 1. If `n` is omitted, or if `n` specifies
  more characters than are left in the string, the length of the substring
  will be limited by the length of the string `s`.

  ```
  tolower(s)
  ```

  Convert the string `s` to lower case.

  ```
  toupper(s)
  ```

  Convert the string `s` to upper case.

  ```
  match(s, pat)
  ```

  Return the position, in characters, numbering from 1, in string `s` where the
  pattern `pat` occurs, or zero if it does not occur at all.
  `pat` must be a literal, not an expression, e.g. `/foo/`.

  ```
  length([s])
  ```

  Return the length, in characters, of its argument taken as a string, or of the whole record, `$0`, if there is no argument.

  ### Running tests in parallel

  In order to run tests in parallel, you have to do the following:

  * Compile (or, more precisely, *link*) your test program with the `-threaded`
    flag;
  * Launch the program with `+RTS -N -RTS`.

  ### Timeout

  To apply timeout to individual tests, use the `--timeout` (or `-t`) command-line
  option, or set the option in your test suite using the `mkTimeout` function.

  Timeouts can be fractional, and can be optionally followed by a suffix `ms`
  (milliseconds), `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), or `h` (hours). When there's no
  suffix, seconds are assumed.

  Example:

      ./test --timeout=0.5m

  sets a 30 seconds timeout for each individual test.

  ### Options controlling console output

  The following options control behavior of the standard console interface:

  <dl>
  <dt><code>-q,--quiet</code></dt>
  <dd>
    Run the tests but don't output anything. The result is indicated only by the
    exit code, which is 1 if at least one test has failed, and 0 if all tests
    have passed. Execution stops when the first failure is detected, so not all
    tests are necessarily run.
    This may be useful for various batch systems, such as commit hooks.
  </dd>
  <dt><code>--hide-successes</code></dt>
  <dd>Report only the tests that has failed. Especially useful when the
  number of tests is large.</dd>
  <dt><code>-l,--list-tests</code></dt>
  <dd>Don't run the tests; only list their names, in the format accepted by
  <code>--pattern</code>.</dd>
  <dt><code>--color</code></dt>
  <dd>Whether to produce colorful output. Accepted values: <code>never</code>,
  <code>always</code>, <code>auto</code>. <code>auto</code> means that colors will
  only be enabled when output goes to a terminal and is the default value.</dd>
  </dl>

  ### Custom options

  It is possible to add custom options, too.

  To do that,

  1. Define a datatype to represent the option, and make it an instance of
     `IsOption`
  2. Register the options with the `includingOptions` ingredient
  3. To query the option value, use `askOption`.

  See the [Custom options in Tasty][custom-options-article] article for some examples.

  ## Project organization and integration with Cabal

  There may be several ways to organize your project. What follows is not
  Tasty's requirements but my recommendations.

  ### Tests for a library

  Place your test suite sources in a dedicated subdirectory (called `tests`
  here) instead of putting them among the main library sources.

  The directory structure will be as follows:

      my-project/
        my-project.cabal
        src/
          ...
        tests/
          test.hs
          Mod1.hs
          Mod2.hs
          ...

  `test.hs` is where your `main` function is defined. The tests may be
  contained in `test.hs` or spread across multiple modules (`Mod1.hs`, `Mod2.hs`,
  ...) which are then imported by `test.hs`.

  Add the following section to the cabal file (`my-project.cabal`):

      test-suite test
        default-language:
          Haskell2010
        type:
          exitcode-stdio-1.0
        hs-source-dirs:
          tests
        main-is:
          test.hs
        build-depends:
            base >= 4 && < 5
          , tasty >= 0.7 -- insert the current version here
          , my-project   -- depend on the library we're testing
          , ...

  ### Tests for a program

  All the above applies, except you can't depend on the library if there's no
  library. You have two options:

  * Re-organize the project into a library and a program, so that both the
    program and the test suite depend on this new library. The library can be
    declared in the same cabal file.
  * Add your program sources directory to the `Hs-source-dirs`. Note that this
    will lead to double compilation (once for the program and once for the test
    suite).

  ## Dependencies

  Tasty executes tests in parallel to make them finish faster.
  If this parallelism is not desirable, you can declare *dependencies* between
  tests, so that one test will not start until certain other tests finish.

  Dependencies are declared using the `after` combinator:

  * `after AllFinish "pattern" my_tests` will execute the test tree `my_tests` only after all
      tests that match the pattern finish.
  * `after AllSucceed "pattern" my_tests` will execute the test tree `my_tests` only after all
      tests that match the pattern finish **and** only if they all succeed. If at
      least one dependency fails, then `my_tests` will be skipped.

  The relevant types are:

  ``` haskell
  after
    :: DependencyType -- ^ whether to run the tests even if some of the dependencies fail
    -> String         -- ^ the pattern
    -> TestTree       -- ^ the subtree that depends on other tests
    -> TestTree       -- ^ the subtree annotated with dependency information

  data DependencyType = AllSucceed | AllFinish
  ```

  The pattern follows the same AWK-like syntax and semantics as described in
  [Patterns](#patterns). There is also a variant named `after_` that accepts the
  AST of the pattern instead of a textual representation.

  Let's consider some typical examples. (A note about terminology: here
  by "resource" I mean anything stateful and external to the test: it could be a file,
  a database record, or even a value stored in an `IORef` that's shared among
  tests. The resource may or may not be managed by `withResource`.)

  1. Two tests, Test A and Test B, access the same shared resource and cannot be
     run concurrently. To achieve this, make Test A a dependency of Test B:

     ``` haskell
     testGroup "Tests accessing the same resource"
       [ testCase "Test A" $ ...
       , after AllFinish "Test A" $
           testCase "Test B" $ ...
       ]
     ```

  1. Test A creates a resource and Test B uses that resource. Like above, we make
     Test A a dependency of Test B, except now we don't want to run Test B if Test
     A failed because the resource may not have been set up properly. So we use
     `AllSucceed` instead of `AllFinish`

     ``` haskell
     testGroup "Tests creating and using a resource"
       [ testCase "Test A" $ ...
       , after AllSucceed "Test A" $
           testCase "Test B" $ ...
       ]
     ```

  Here are some caveats to keep in mind regarding dependencies in Tasty:

  1. If Test B depends on Test A, remember that either of the may be filtered out
     using the `--pattern` option. Collecting the dependency info happens *after*
     filtering. Therefore, if Test A is filtered out, Test B will run
     unconditionally, and if Test B is filtered out, it simply won't run.
  1. Tasty does not currently check whether the pattern in a dependency matches
     anything at all, so make sure your patterns are correct and do not contain
     typos. Fortunately, misspecified dependencies usually lead to test failures
     and so can be detected that way.
  1. Dependencies shouldn't form a cycle, otherwise Tasty with fail with the
     message "Test dependencies form a loop." A common cause of this is a test
     matching its own dependency pattern.
  1. Using dependencies may introduce quadratic complexity. Specifically,
     resolving dependencies is *O(number_of_tests × number_of_dependencies)*,
     since each pattern has to be matched against each test name. As a guideline,
     if you have up to 1000 tests, the overhead will be negligible, but if you
     have thousands of tests or more, then you probably shouldn't have more than a
     few dependencies.

     Additionally, it is recommended that the dependencies follow the
     natural order of tests, i.e. that the later tests in the test tree depend on
     the earlier ones and not vice versa. If the execution order mandated by the
     dependencies is sufficiently different from the natural order of tests in the
     test tree, searching for the next test to execute may also have an
     overhead quadratic in the number of tests.


  ## FAQ

  1.  **Q**: When my tests write to stdout/stderr, the output is garbled. Why is that and
      what do I do?

      **A**: It is not recommended that you print anything to the console when using the
      console test reporter (which is the default one).
      See [#103](https://github.com/feuerbach/tasty/issues/103) for the
      discussion.

      Some ideas on how to work around this:

      * Use [testCaseSteps](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-hunit/docs/Test-Tasty-HUnit.html#v:testCaseSteps) (for tasty-hunit only).
      * Use a test reporter that does not print to the console (like tasty-ant-xml).
      * Write your output to files instead.

  2.  **Q**: Why doesn't the `--hide-successes` option work properly? The test headings
      show up and/or the output appears garbled.

      **A**: This can happen sometimes when the terminal is narrower than the
      output. A workaround is to disable ANSI tricks: pass `--ansi-tricks=false`
      on the command line or set `TASTY_ANSI_TRICKS=false` in the environment.

      See [issue #152](https://github.com/feuerbach/tasty/issues/152).
