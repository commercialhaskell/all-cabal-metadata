description: |-
  Taxonomy Tool utilizes functions from the Taxonomy library to provide

  several commandline utilities for routine-tasks with taxonomy data.

  Currently some tools accept either the <ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/ NCBI taxonomy dump> as input,

  while other retrieve the data directly from the <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gquery/ NCBI Entrez REST> interface.

  It is planned to support both datasources with each tool.

  Usage instructions can be found in the <https://github.com/eggzilla/TaxonomyTools README>

  Currently following Tools are included:

  * Accessions2TaxIds:
  Converts a list of NCBI accession numbers into NCBI taxonomy ids

  * TaxIds2Tree:
  List of taxonomy ids is converted into a graphical tree representation
  either as .svg (via graphviz) or as .json (via d3js).

  * TaxIds2TreeCompare:
  Multiple lists of taxonomy ids are converted into a visualisation of the
  taxonomic tree highlighting the input nodes corresponding to their list.

  * TaxIds2Text:
  List of taxonomy ids is converted in a short text summary for each node.

  * TreeDistance:
  Computes the distance between two input nodes on the given tree.
