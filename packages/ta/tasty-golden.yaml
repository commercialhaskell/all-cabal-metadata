  Changes
  =======

  Version 2.3.6
  -------------

  * Option `--no-create-file` now available internally as `NoCreateFile`
    ([Issue #50](https://github.com/UnkindPartition/tasty-golden/issues/50))
  * Drop support for GHC 7, remove obsolete `deriving Typeable`
  * Tested with GHC 8.0 - 9.14.1

  _Andreas Abel, 2026-02-01_

  Version 2.3.5
  -------------

  * Fixes for launching external processes (like `diff`) on Windows
  * Update the golden file on `--accept` if decoding the golden file failed with an exception
  * Do not depend on `unix-compat`

  Version 2.3.4
  -------------

  * Add an option to remove the output file after a test has run, if there is
    a golden file, or one has been created

  Version 2.3.3.3
  ---------------

  * Fix a bug where `goldenVsFileDiff` would not create a missing golden file

  Version 2.3.3.2
  ---------------

  * Fix a bug where the `TASTY_SIZE_CUTOFF` env. variable would be ignored

  Version 2.3.3.1
  ---------------

  * Fix a bug with UTF-8 output

  Version 2.3.3
  -------------

  * Expose `createDirectoriesAndWriteFile`
  * Add `--size-cutoff` to truncate large golden test output
  * Restore support for GHC >= 7.8

  Version 2.3.2.1
  ---------------

  Create missing directories when writing golden files

  Version 2.3.2
  -------------

  Add a `--no-create` flag

  Version 2.3.1.3
  ---------------

  Make the environment variable `TASTY_ACCEPT=True` work, and make the value
      case-insensitive (so `TASTY_ACCEPT=true` works, too)

  Version 2.3.1.2
  ---------------

  Docs: link to an introductory blog post

  Version 2.3.1.1
  ---------------

  Fix compatibility with `optparse-applicative-0.13`

  Version 2.3.1
  -------------

  Intercept exceptions thrown by the test, adhering to the new tasty API
  contract.

  Version 2.3.0.2
  ---------------

  Switch from `temporary-rc` to `temporary`

  Version 2.3.0.1
  ---------------

  Impose a lower bound version constraint on `bytestring`.

  Version 2.3
  -----------

  * Accepting tests is no longer done by a separate ingredient; instead it is now
    an option that affects tests themselves.
      * `--accept` used to run only golden tests; now all tests are run, but only
        golden tests are affected by this option
      * when accepting, all the usual options apply (such as `-j`)
      * when accepting, the interace is the same as when running
      * `defaultMain` and `acceptingTests` are kept for compatibility, but do not
        do anything and are obsolete
  * When a golden test file does not exist, it is created automatically, even when
    `--accept` is not specified. You'll see a message like

          UnboxedTuples:                 OK (0.04s)
            Golden file did not exist; created

  * No longer use lazy IO
      * `ValueGetter` type is gone (replaced by `IO`)
      * Because of that, the type of the primitive `goldenTest` is changed
      * `vgReadFile` function is gone (replaced by `Data.ByteString.readFile`)

  Version 2.2.2.4
  ---------------

  * Warn when some tests threw exceptions during `--accept`
  * Properly handle exceptions; don't swallow Ctrl-C

  Version 2.2.2.3
  ---------------

  Restore compatibility with older compilers

  Version 2.2.2.1
  ---------------

  Relax `Cabal` dependency

  Version 2.2.2
  -------------

  Add `findByExtension`

  Version 2.2.1.2
  ---------------

  Catch exceptions when accepting golden tests

  Version 2.2.1.1
  ---------------

  Switch to `temporary-rc`

  Version 2.2.1
  -------------

  * Fix a bug where the result of the comparison function would reference yet
    unread data from a semiclosed file and the file gets closed, leading to a
    runtime exception
  * Export `writeBinaryFile`
  * Improve the docs
  * Update to work with `tasty-0.8`

  Version 2.2.0.2

  This package provides support for «golden testing».

  A golden test is an IO action that writes its result to a file.
  To pass the test, this output file should be identical to the corresponding
  «golden» file, which contains the correct result for the test.

  To **get started** with golden testing and this library, see
  [Introduction to golden testing](https://ro-che.info/articles/2017-12-04-golden-tests).

  Command-line options
  --------------------

  To see the command-line options, run your test suite with `--help`. Here's an
  example output:

  ```
  Mmm... tasty test suite

  Usage: test [-p|--pattern PATTERN] [-t|--timeout DURATION] [-l|--list-tests]
              [-j|--num-threads NUMBER] [-q|--quiet] [--hide-successes]
              [--color never|always|auto] [--ansi-tricks ARG] [--accept]
              [--no-create] [--size-cutoff n]
              [--delete-output never|onpass|always]

  Available options:
    -h,--help                Show this help text
    -p,--pattern PATTERN     Select only tests which satisfy a pattern or awk
                             expression
    -t,--timeout DURATION    Timeout for individual tests (suffixes: ms,s,m,h;
                             default: s)
    -l,--list-tests          Do not run the tests; just print their names
    -j,--num-threads NUMBER  Number of threads to use for tests
                             execution (default: # of cores/capabilities)
    -q,--quiet               Do not produce any output; indicate success only by
                             the exit code
    --hide-successes         Do not print tests that passed successfully
    --color never|always|auto
                             When to use colored output (default: auto)
    --ansi-tricks ARG        Enable various ANSI terminal tricks. Can be set to
                             'true' or 'false'. (default: true)
    --accept                 Accept current results of golden tests
    --no-create              Error when golden file does not exist
    --size-cutoff n          hide golden test output if it's larger than n
                             bytes (default: 1000)
    --delete-output never|onpass|always
                             If there is a golden file, when to delete output
                             files (default: never)
  ```
