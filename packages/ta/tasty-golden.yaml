  Changes
  =======

  Version 2.3.5
  -------------

  * Fixes for launching external processes (like diff) on Windows
  * Update the golden file on --accept if decoding the golden file failed with an exception
  * Do not depend on unix-compat

  Version 2.3.4
  -------------

  * Add an option to remove the output file after a test has run, if there is
    a golden file, or one has been created

  Version 2.3.3.3
  ---------------

  * Fix a bug where `goldenVsFileDiff` would not create a missing golden file

  Version 2.3.3.2
  ---------------

  * Fix a bug where the `TASTY_SIZE_CUTOFF` env. variable would be ignored

  Version 2.3.3.1
  ---------------

  * Fix a bug with UTF-8 output

  Version 2.3.3
  -------------

  * Expose `createDirectoriesAndWriteFile`
  * Add `--size-cutoff` to truncate large golden test output
  * Restore support for GHC >= 7.8

  Version 2.3.2.1
  ---------------

  Create missing directories when writing golden files

  Version 2.3.2
  -------------

  Add a `--no-create` flag

  Version 2.3.1.3
  ---------------

  Make the environment variable `TASTY_ACCEPT=True` work, and make the value
      case-insensitive (so `TASTY_ACCEPT=true` works, too)

  Version 2.3.1.2
  ---------------

  Docs: link to an introductory blog post

  Version 2.3.1.1
  ---------------

  Fix compatibility with `optparse-applicative-0.13`

  Version 2.3.1
  -------------

  Intercept exceptions thrown by the test, adhering to the new tasty API
  contract.

  Version 2.3.0.2
  ---------------

  Switch from temporary-rc to temporary

  Version 2.3.0.1
  ---------------

  Impose a lower bound version constraint on bytestring.

  Version 2.3
  -----------

  * Accepting tests is no longer done by a separate ingredient; instead it is now
    an option that affects tests themselves.
      * `--accept` used to run only golden tests; now all tests are run, but only
        golden tests are affected by this option
      * when accepting, all the usual options apply (such as `-j`)
      * when accepting, the interace is the same as when running
      * `defaultMain` and `acceptingTests` are kept for compatibility, but do not
        do anything and are obsolete
  * When a golden test file does not exist, it is created automatically, even when
    `--accept` is not specified. You'll see a message like

          UnboxedTuples:                 OK (0.04s)
            Golden file did not exist; created

  * No longer use lazy IO
      * `ValueGetter` type is gone (replaced by `IO`)
      * Because of that, the type of the primitive `goldenTest` is changed
      * `vgReadFile` function is gone (replaced by `Data.ByteString.readFile`)

  Version 2.2.2.4
  ---------------

  * Warn when some tests threw exceptions during `--accept`
  * Properly handle exceptions; don't swallow Ctrl-C

  Version 2.2.2.3
  ---------------

  Restore compatibility with older compilers

  Version 2.2.2.1
  ---------------

  Relax `Cabal` dependency

  Version 2.2.2
  -------------

  Add `findByExtension`

  Version 2.2.1.2
  ---------------

  Catch exceptions when accepting golden tests

  Version 2.2.1.1
  ---------------

  Switch to `temporary-rc`

  Version 2.2.1
  -------------

  * Fix a bug where the result of the comparison function would reference yet
    unread data from a semiclosed file and the file gets closed, leading to a
    runtime exception
  * Export `writeBinaryFile`
  * Improve the docs
  * Update to work with `tasty-0.8`

  Version 2.2.0.2

  Update to work with `tasty-0.7`

  ---------------

  Update to work with `tasty-0.5`

description: |-
  This package provides support for «golden testing».
  A golden test is an IO action that writes its result to a file.
  To pass the test, this output file should be identical to the corresponding
  «golden» file, which contains the correct result for the test.
  To get started with golden testing and this library, see
  <https://ro-che.info/articles/2017-12-04-golden-tests Introduction to golden testing>.
