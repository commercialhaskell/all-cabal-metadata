  # Revision history for tasty-sugar

  ## 1.1.1.0 -- 2021-04-19

   * Use 'kvitable' to render `--showsearch` output.
   * Update build warnings and refactor code to remove potential partial
     results.
   * Fix tasty ingredients option double-defaulting.
   * Add dependency constraint bounds.
   * Update haddock usage for usage changes.

  ## 1.1.0.0 -- 2021-01-31

   * Allow multiple tests to be generated for each `Expectation` via
     `withSugarGroups` function.  The `withSugarGroups` third argument
     function (the test generator) now returns a list instead of a
     single test.  While roughly the same effect could have been
     achieved by the test generator function using a `testGroup` to wrap
     multiple tests, this change allows both (a) multiple tests to be
     generated without requiring another level in the test heirarchy,
     and (b) the generator can return an empty list if there should not
     be any tests generated for the specified `Expectation`.

  ## 1.0.2.0 -- 2021-01-31

   * Export `paramMatchVal` utility function

   * Fix over-trimming of `Expectation` matches

   * Fix identification ranking of associated files


  ## 1.0.1.1 -- 2021-01-18

   * Fix error where an expected set of matches could match multiple
     root names where the root names contain separators.

  ## 1.0.1.0 -- 2021-01-18

   * Associated files are now ranked based on the number of parameter
     components in the name and only the highest number of matches are
     provided.  Previously all possible matches were supplied, which
     meant that "more generic" associations caused an Expectation in
     addition to the "more specific" associations.  Now only the "more
     specific" assocations cause an Expectation.

   * Better indentation on Expectation information for --showsearch.

  ## 1.0.0.0 -- 2021-01-14

   * Allow multiple CUBE inputs for a single test session; Sweets are a semigroup.

   * Run the withSugarGroups mkSweets in MonadIO instead of pure.

   * Remove blank lines in --showsearch output.

  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2021-01-12

   * Renamed CUBE "source" to "rootName"

   * Updated Sweets structure to show root match base and match name

   * Rewritten implementation using Logic capabilities.  Clarified many
     corner cases and fully implemented all logic.

  * Significantly enhanced testing.

   * Updated documentation.

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2019-12-24

  * Initial version.

description: "#+TITLE:  Tasty SUGAR - Search Using Golden Answer References\n#+AUTHOR:
  Kevin Quick <kquick@galois.com>\n\n* Tasty SUGAR -  Search Using Golden Answer References\n\n
  \ The ~tasty-sugar~ package extends the tasty testing framework with\n  the ability
  to generate tests based on golden answer files found for\n  specific inputs.  Multiple
  answers may be specified with different\n  parameterization, and there can be associated
  files that are\n  presented to the test as well.\n\n  The primary use of tasty-sugar
  is to _generate test cases_ based on\n  the contents of a directory, where the presence
  of various files\n  determine which tests are generated.\n\n** Elements of tasty-sugar:\n\n
  \   * Tasty.Sugar.CUBE :: Configuration Using Base Expectations\n\n         Describes
  the configuration for tasty-sugar tests, including\n         where they are located
  and what syntax the files should have.\n\n    * Tasty.Sugar.Sweets :: Specifications
  With Existing Expected Testing Samples\n\n         The tasty-sugar library uses
  one or more CUBE's to generate a\n         set of test configurations based on the
  existing files found,\n         outputting a list of Sweets representing the existing
  test\n         data.\n\n#     * KWQ: something to generate the tests\n#     * KWQ:
  name of the test runner to show the tests\n#     * KWQ: a test runner or option
  to write new outputs\n\n* How to use tasty-sugar\n\n  Full information on tasty-sugar
  features and capabilities will be\n  provided in a later [[id:de026768-f805-4d30-8299-522cdd70926b][Detailed
  Information]] section, but this is a\n  quick introduction describing various testing
  use cases and how\n  tasty-sugar can be used in those use cases.\n\n  For these
  motivational use cases, the example scenario basis is that\n  the target to be tested
  is a tool to parse binary ELF files and\n  generate various output information about
  those files (e.g. similar\n  to objdump, but in a Haskell library form).\n\n** Single
  Expected Output per Test\n\n  * Scenario :: When running a test, it generates output
  that should\n                be compared to the expected data maintained in a file.\n
  \               There is a simple, single expected output for each\n                test,
  and no inputs other than the test name.\n\n  For the example scenario, several actual
  ELF binary files were\n  collected and placed in the ~test/samples~ directory:\n\n
  \  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE\n   $ ls test/samples\n   empty.txt\n   fibonacci.c\n   fibonacci\n
  \  foo.tar\n   hello.c\n   hello\n   ls.c\n   ls\n   tmux.c\n   tmux\n   $\n   #+END_EXAMPLE\n\n
  \  Note that there are a couple of non-ELF files in there as well, to\n   verify
  the errors generated by our library when given\n\n   The actual outputs aren't known
  yet, but tasty-sugar can help with\n   that.  Setup the tasty-sugar CUBE configuration
  as follows:\n\n   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE\n   cube = mkCUBE { inputDir = \"test/samples\"\n
  \                , rootName = \"*.c\"\n                 , expectedSuffix = \"exp\"\n
  \                , associatedNames = [ (\"binary\", \"\") ]\n                 }\n
  \  main = do testSweets <- findSugar cube\n             tests <- withSugarGroups
  testSweets testGroup $\n               \\sweets expIdx expectation -> return $\n
  \                testCase (rootMatchName sweets <> \" #\" <> show expIdx) $ do\n
  \                  let Just binaryName = lookup \"binary\" $ associated expectation\n
  \                  r <- runTestOn binaryName\n                   e <- readFile $
  expectedFile expectation\n                   r @?= e\n             defaultMain $
  testGroup \"elf\" tests\n\n   runTestOn :: FilePath -> IO String\n   runTestOn f
  = ...\n   #+END_EXAMPLE\n\n   The tasty-sugar framework does not provide the actual
  testing: that\n   is still provided by the developer.  Instead, the tasty-sugar\n
  \  framework reads the contents of the ~test/samples~ directory and\n   analyses
  the available files to create a list of tests that should\n   be run.  The tasty-sugar
  package also provides a function that can\n   organize the tests and invoke the
  user's test function once for\n   each test configuration.\n\n   If the tests are
  run at this point, the tasty-sugar framework will\n   do nothing.\n\n   Why?\n\n
  \  The tasty-sugar framework will ignore any files in the target\n   directory that
  do not have an associated expected file describing\n   the expected output.  This
  can be confirmed by running the tests\n   with the ~--showsearch~ argument, which
  will use an alternate tasty\n   ingredient that does not actually run the tests
  but write out the\n   search process and search results.\n\n   To get actual tests
  to run, simply create an expected file for each\n   of the input candidates.  The
  contents of the file can be empty, or\n   any random data.\n\n   Running the tests
  now will result in a test created for each input\n   file that has a corresponding
  ~*.exp~ file.  Note that tasty-sweet\n   doesn't actually read in any of the files,
  just invokes the test\n   creation function with the Sweets and Expectation data
  structures\n   that let the test do whatever is appropriate.\n\n   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE\n
  \  $ ls test/samples\n   empty.txt\n   empty.txt.exp\n   fibonacci\n   finonacci.c\n
  \  fibonacci.exp\n   foo.tar\n   foo.tar.exp\n   hello\n   hello.c\n   hello.exp\n
  \  ls\n   ls.c\n   ls.exp\n   tmux\n   tmux.c\n   $\n   #+END_EXAMPLE\n\n   Note
  that ~empty.txt~ and ~foo.tar~ will be ignored, even though\n   there is an ~.exp~
  file for them because they don't match the\n   source target of ~*.c~.  Similarly,
  ~tmux~ will be ignored because\n   there is no ~.exp~ file for it.\n\n   At this
  point, any changes to the target library that cause output\n   changes will be identified
  when running the tests.\n\n** Single Input and Output per Test\n\n  * Scenario ::
  Similar to the previous scenario, but there is a file\n                containing
  the expected input needed by the test to\n                generate the output.\n\n
  \ To extend the previous example, let us assume that in addition to\n  the pre-existing
  binaries that we will be generating a number of\n  \"interesting\" binaries to run
  the target library on.  These will be\n  kept in a different directory where a different
  part of the build\n  will compile the sources to generate the binaries for testing:\n\n
  \ #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE\n  $ ls test/src_samples\n  foo.c\n  foo\n  foo.expct\n  simple.c\n
  \ simple\n  simple.expct\n  recursive.rs\n  recursive\n  recursive.expct\n  functional.hs\n
  \ functional\n  functional.expct\n  $\n  #+END_EXAMPLE\n\n  Note that there are
  several different source types (C, Rust,\n  Haskell) involved, but each of them
  has an associated output binary\n  that the target library should be tested on.\n\n
  \ In an initial approach, the source files can be ignored by the\n  testing code:
  simply create a ~FILE.expct~ file for each of the\n  binaries and use the same ~Tasty.Sugar.CUBE~
  configuration for this\n  directory as for the previous directory.\n\n  However
  however an approach where the actual test written by the\n  user needs access to
  the source file itself for some reason.  This\n  can be handled by specifying an
  \"associated\" file in the\n  ~Tasty.Sugar.CUBE~ configuration:\n\n   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE\n
  \  cube = mkCUBE { inputDir = \"test/samples\"\n                 , rootName = \"*.exe\"\n
  \                , expectedSuffix = \"expct\"\n                 , associatedNames
  = [ (\"c-source\", \".c\")\n                                     , (\"rust-source\",
  \".rs\")\n                                     , (\"haskell\", \".hs)\n                                     ]\n
  \                }\n\n   ingredients = includingOptions sugarOptions :\n                 sugarIngredients
  [cube] <> defaultIngredients\n\n   main = do testSweets <- findSugar cube\n             tests
  <- withSugarGroups testSweets testGroup $\n               \\sweets expIdx expectation
  -> return $\n                 testCase (rootMatchName sweets <> \" #\" <> show expIdx)
  $ do\n                   e <- readFile $ expectedFile expectation\n                   let
  assoc = associated expectation\n                       f = rootFile sweets\n                   r
  <- case lookup \"c-source\" assoc of\n                          Just c -> runCTestOn
  f\n                          Nothing ->\n                            case lookup
  \"rust-source\" assoc of\n                              Just r -> runRustTestOn
  f\n                              Nothing ->\n                                runHaskellTestOn
  f\n                   r @?= e\n             defaultMainWithIngredients ingredients
  $\n               testGroup \"elf\" tests\n\n   runCTestOn :: FilePath -> IO String\n
  \  runCTestOn f = ...\n\n   runRustTestOn :: FilePath -> IO String\n   runRustTestOn
  f = ...\n\n   runHaskellTestOn :: FilePath -> IO String\n   runHaskellTestOn f =
  ...\n   #+END_EXAMPLE\n\n  Now when tasty-sugar generates the test configurations,
  each test\n  will have a name, a source file, an expected file, and a single\n  associated
  file.  The test is free to use these files in any way it\n  sees fit.  For the configuration
  above, there would be 4 test\n  configurations provided to the test:\n\n  | Test
  Name  | Input File | Expected File    | Associated Files                |\n  |------------+------------+------------------+---------------------------------|\n
  \ | simple     | simple     | simple.expct     | (\"c-source\", \"simple.c\")        |\n
  \ | foo        | foo        | foo.expct        | (\"c-source\", \"foo.c\")           |\n
  \ | recursive  | recursive  | recursive.expct  | (\"rust-source\", \"recursive.rs\")
  |\n  | functional | functional | functional.expct | (\"haskell\", \"functional.hs\")
  \   |\n\n  Note that if both \"simple.c\" and \"simple.hs\" files existed, then
  the\n  simple test configuration would get both as associated files.\n\n** Single
  Input with different parameters producing different outputs\n\n  * Scenario :: For
  each input file, multiple tests should be run,\n                each with different
  parameters, and the expected\n                output may or may not depend on the
  parameter.\n\n  Using the previous example scenario, let's now assume that for each\n
  \ of the source sample files, two different executables were built:\n  one with
  and one without optimization.  Additionally, if they were a\n  C source file, then
  there was a version built with GCC and a version\n  built with Clang.  The output
  executables are now named accordingly:\n\n  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE\n  $ ls test/src_samples\n
  \ foo.c\n  foo.noopt.clang.exe\n  foo.O0.gcc.exe\n  foo.opt.clang.exe\n  foo.O2.gcc.exe\n
  \ foo.O3.gcc.exe\n  simple.c\n  simple.noopt.clang.exe\n  simple.noopt.gcc.exe\n
  \ simple.opt-clang.exe\n  simple-opt.gcc-exe\n  recursive.rs\n  recursive.noopt.exe\n
  \ recursive.opt.exe\n  functional.hs\n  functional.noopt.exe\n  functional.opt.exe\n
  \ $\n  #+END_EXAMPLE\n\n  While the filenames are fairly regular, there are different
  numbers\n  of executables and different naming conventions for different files.\n\n
  \ The opt/noopt/O0/O2/O3 and gcc/clang information is known to\n  tasty-sugar as
  a \"parameter\".  Parameters can appear in the filename\n  in a specific order,
  and each parameter may have one of a set of\n  valid values (e.g. gcc or clang)
  or it may have any (free-form)\n  value (as with the optimization specification).\n\n
  \ The ~Tasty.Sugar.CUBE~ confguration for is scenario is updated to:\n\n   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE\n
  \  cube = mkCUBE { inputDir = \"test/samples\"\n                 , rootName = \"*\"\n
  \                , separators = \"-.\"\n                 , expectedSuffix = \"expct\"\n
  \                , associatedNames = [ (\"c-source\", \".c\")\n                                     ,
  (\"rust-source\", \".rs\")\n                                     , (\"haskell\",
  \".hs\")\n                                     ]\n                 , validParams
  = [\n                    (\"optimization\", Nothing)\n                   ,(\"c-compiler\",
  Just [\"gcc\", \"clang\"])\n                   ]\n                 }\n\n   ingredients
  = includingOptions sugarOptions :\n                 sugarIngredients [cube] <> defaultIngredients\n\n
  \  main = do testSweets <- findSugar cube\n             tests <- withSugarGroups
  testSweets testGroup $\n               \\sweets expIdx expectation -> return $\n
  \                testCase (rootMatchName sweets <> \" #\" <> show expIdx) $ do\n
  \                  e <- readFile $ expectedFile expectation\n                   let
  assoc = associated expectation\n                       f = rootFile sweets\n                   r
  <- case lookup \"c-source\" assoc of\n                          Just c -> runCTestOn
  f\n                          Nothing ->\n                            case lookup
  \"rust-source\" assoc of\n                              Just r -> runRustTestOn
  f\n                              Nothing -> runHaskellTestOn f\n                   r
  @?= e\n             defaultMainWithIngredients ingredients $\n             testGroup
  \"elf\" tests\n\n   runCTestOn :: FilePath -> String\n   runCTestOn f = ...\n\n
  \  runRustTestOn :: FilePath -> String\n   runRustTestOn f = ...\n\n   runHaskellTestOn
  :: FilePath -> String\n   runHaskellTestOn f = ...\n   #+END_EXAMPLE\n\n  Parameters
  are separated by designated separator characters and must\n  appear in the order
  declared.  The default separators are \".\" and\n  \"-\" (e.g. both of the two optimized
  executable files for the\n  simple.c source above are accepted).  \n\n  Filenames
  may omit later parameter values: the file is assumed to\n  apply to all unspecified
  parameter values if there is no more\n  specific override.  This can be very useful
  to avoid repetition and\n  copying when specifying test files.  \n\n  In the above
  example, a ~simple.expected~ file would be used for all\n  four executables, but
  if there was also a\n  ~simple.noopt-gcc.expected~ and a ~simple-opt.expected~ then
  the\n  former would be used only for the ~simple.noopt.gcc.exe~ and the\n  latter
  would be used for both the ~gcc~ and the ~clang~ executables,\n  leaving the ~sample.expected~
  to be used only for the\n  ~simple.opt-clang.exe~ file.\n\n# ** Multiple Inputs
  with different parameters producing different outputs\n# \n#     KWQ...\n\n* Comparisons\n\n**
  tasty-KAT\n\n  * The tasty-KAT package reads both the inputs and the outputs from
  a\n    single file, instaed of allowing the inputs to be a separate file\n    that
  can be processed by the target under test.\n\n    + The tasty-sugar package allows
  inputs and outputs to be in\n      separate files, and additional \"associated\"
  files to be provided\n      as inputs to the test.\n\n  * The tasty-KAT package
  inputs and outputs must be specifiable in a\n    file with other KAT markup; this
  does not easily handle text\n    markup conflicts and binary inputs/outputs.\n\n
  \   + The tasty-sugar package does not attempt to interpret the\n      contents
  of the files, but simply passes them to the test\n      itself.\n\n  * The tasty-KAT
  package does not allow auxiliary files, or different\n    parameterized tests.\n\n
  \   + As mentioned above, tasty-sugar allows multiple auxiliary files\n      per
  tests, and allows test inputs and expected outputs to be\n      filename parameterized
  (with either constrained or free-form\n      parameter values).\n\n** tasty-golden\n\n
  \ * The tasty-golden package requires a 1:1 association between tests\n    and corresponding
  golden expected output files; it does not\n    support file-provided inputs, or
  associated files.\n\n    + The tasty-sugar package allows multiple associated files
  in\n      addition to the primary input file.\n\n    + The tasty-sugar package supports
  parameterization of expected\n      results (and associated files) as part of the
  filenames to allow\n      multiple tests per input.\n\n  * The tasty-golden package
  will write the expected results if the\n    expected file is missing.\n\n    + The
  tasty-sugar package does not actually read or write any of\n      the files identified,
  it simply provides the names of the files\n      to the test generator function.
  \ The user's test code is\n      responsible for all file processing.\n\n** tasty-silver\n\n
  \ Similar to tasty-golden in functionality.\n\n** Features unique to tasty-sugar\n\n
  \ * Multiple potential outputs, parameterized by filename elements.\n\n  * Multiple
  associated input files.\n\n  * Search analysis mode showing how tests are generated
  based on the\n    available files.\n\n  * Automatic grouping of generated tests
  by parameter values.\n\n* Limitations\n\n  * Huge directories\n  * Huge files\n
  \ * Will throw any exception that the listDirectory function can throw.\n\n* Detailed
  Information\n  :PROPERTIES:\n  :ID:       de026768-f805-4d30-8299-522cdd70926b\n
  \ :END:\n\n** Requirements\n\n  * There must be a root (input) file to feed to the
  test\n\n  * There must be one or more \"expected\" results files for a root file\n\n
  \ * There may be associated files for the root file required for the test\n\n  *
  All three groups of files may be parameterized by additional fields.\n\n  * All
  fields are represented by a common basename with optional\n    parameters and required
  associated suffixes, separated by\n    allowable separators.\n\n  All of the above
  may utilize globbing as provided by System.FilePath.Glob\n\n* Examples\n\n** Example:\n\n
  For example, a test which would verify that the size of a compiled\n file meets
  the expectations would specify:\n\n #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE\n CUBE =\n   { inputDir = \"tests/samples\"

  to be described by a ~Tasty.Sugar.CUBE~\n  data object?  Why can't they be passed
  in on the command-line?\n\n  * Answer :: They could be, but there are a couple of
  issues that\n              would make that more awkward:\n\n              1. There
  would need to be a number of command-line\n                 arguments to describe
  all of the CUBE information.\n\n              2. The tasty framework provides command-line
  parsing and\n                 argument handling (and expects to do so).  Handling\n
  \                some command-line arguments prior to tasty and some\n                 within
  tasty would be difficult and brittle (and also\n                 note that the set
  of all tests must be known *prior*\n                 to invoking the tasty main
  code; they cannot be added\n                 dynamically after that point).\n"
