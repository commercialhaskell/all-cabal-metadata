  # Revision history for tasty-test

  ## 0.1.2.0 -- 2023-09-10

  * Add compatibility with Tasty 1.5
  * Add `--tix-dir` flag for specifying directory for tix files.

  ## 0.1.1.0 -- 2023-09-07

  * Be more specific with the file suffixes which are computed from the test outcome. Previously only "PASSED" and "FAILED" were used. We now also use "EXCEPTION", "TIMEOUT" and "SKIPPED".
  * If the name of the test contains a path separator, then this path separator is removed from the name of the generated tix file (#5)
  * Add commandline option "--remove-tix-hash" which replaces the hash in the tix files with "0". This is useful for golden testing the output of the tasty-coverage ingredient.

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2023-08-21

  * Release of first version on Hackage

description: "# tasty-coverage\n\nA [tasty](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty)
  ingredient which allows to generate per-test coverage data.\n\nIf the GHC compiler
  is passed the `-fhpc` flag, then the generated code is instrumented in order to
  also emit information about the executed parts of the sourcecode at runtime.\nThis
  coverage information is written to a file with the suffix `.tix`.\nFor testsuites
  it is sometimes more useful to have the coverage information for each test individually.\nThis
  information can be collected using the methods from the `Trace.Hpc.Reflect` module
  from the [hpc](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hpc) library.\nThe `tasty-coverage`
  package provides a simple ingredient for the [tasty](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty)
  testsuite driver which allows to run the testsuite with the `--report-coverage`
  option.\nWhen this option is passed, one `.tix` file is generated for each individual
  test.\nPassing tests have the file suffix `PASSED.tix`, whereas failing tests have
  the suffix `FAILED.tix`.\n\n```console\n> cabal run tasty-coverage-test -- --help\nMmm...
  tasty test suite\n\nUsage: tasty-coverage-test [-p|--pattern PATTERN] [-t|--timeout
  DURATION] \n                           [--report-coverage]\n\nAvailable options:\n
  \ -h,--help                Show this help text\n  -p,--pattern PATTERN     Select
  only tests which satisfy a pattern or awk\n                           expression\n
  \ -t,--timeout DURATION    Timeout for individual tests (suffixes: ms,s,m,h;\n                           default:
  s)\n  --report-coverage        Generate per-test coverage data\n\n> cabal run tasty-coverage-test
  -- --report-coverage\nWrote coverage file: tix/UnitTests.testOne.PASSED.tix\nWrote
  coverage file: tix/UnitTests.testTwo.PASSED.tix\nWrote coverage file: tix/UnitTests.testThree.FAILED.tix\n```\n"
