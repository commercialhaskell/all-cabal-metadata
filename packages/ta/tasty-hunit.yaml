  Changes
  =======

  Version 0.10.1
  ---------------

  * Provide an explicit implementation of `displayException`
    in `instance Exception HUnitFailure`
    ([#330](https://github.com/UnkindPartition/tasty/issues/330)).

  Version 0.10.0.3
  ----------------

  The only point of this release is to introduce compatibility with GHCs back to 7.0
  (see https://github.com/UnkindPartition/tasty/pull/287).

  Note, however, that these changes are not merged to the master branch, and the
  future releases will only support the GHC/base versions from the last 5 years,
  as per our usual policy. To test with even older GHCs, you'll have to use this
  particular version of tasty-hunit (or have the constraint solver pick it for you
  when testing with older GHCs).

  The source of this release is in the `support-old-ghcs` branch of the tasty
  repository.

  Version 0.10.0.2
  ----------------

  Catch all exceptions and time each step in testCaseSteps

  Version 0.10.0.1
  ----------------

  Un-deprecate `(@?)` and `AssertionPredicable` and improve their docs

  Version 0.10
  ------------

  * Make `assertFailure`'s return type polymorphic
  * When a test fails, print the source location of the failing assertion
  * Deprecate `Assertable`, `AssertionPredicate`, `AssertionPredicable`, `(@?)`

  Version 0.9.2
  -------------

  Add `testCaseInfo` for tests that return some information upon success

  Version 0.9.1
  -------------

  Add `testCaseSteps` for multi-step tests

  Version 0.9.0.1
  ---------------

  Split the changelog out of the main tasty changelog

  Version 0.9
  -----------

  tasty-hunit now does not depend on the original HUnit package. The functions
  that were previously re-exported from HUnit have been simply copied to
  tasty-hunit.

  This is motivated by:

  * efficiency (one less package to compile/install)
  * reliability (if something happens with HUnit, we won't be affected)

  The two packages are still compatible, except for the name clashes and
  distinct exception types being thrown on assertion failures.

  Version 0.8.0.1
  ---------------

  Fix unbuildable haddock

  Version 0.8
  -----------

  * Exceptions are now handled by tasty rather than by HUnit
  * Update to tasty-0.8

  Version 0.4.1
  -------------

  Do not re-export HUnit's `Testable` class

  Version 0.2
  -----------

  Re-export useful bits of `Test.HUnit` from `Test.Tasty.HUnit`

  HUnit support for the Tasty test framework.

  Note that this package does not depend on HUnit but
  implements the relevant subset of its API. The name is a
  legacy of the early versions of tasty-hunit and of
  test-framework-hunit, which did depend on HUnit.
