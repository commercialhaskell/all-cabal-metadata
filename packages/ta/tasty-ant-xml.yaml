changelog: |
  # 1.1.9

  ## Other changes

  * Support `tasty-1.5`. Thanks to @sergv (PR #34).

  # 1.1.8

  ## Other Changes

  * Support `tasty-1.4`. Due to major API changes, 1.4 is now the minimum version
    of `tasty` supported. Thanks to @jkachmar (PR #31).

  # 1.1.7

  ## Other Changes

  * Bump upper bound of `tasty`.

  # 1.1.6

  ## Functionality Changes

  * The order of tests is now reversed from what was previously output (which was
    itself reversed). This means that tests are now reported in the order they are
    defined, as expected. Thanks to @feuerbach for this fix. See
    https://github.com/ocharles/tasty-ant-xml/pull/28 for more information.


  # 1.1.5

  ## Other Changes

  * Bump upper bound of `tasty`.


  # 1.1.4

  ## Other Changes

  * Bump upper bound of `tasty`.


  # 1.1.3

  ## Other Changes

  * Bump upper bound of `tasty`.


  # 1.1.2

  ## Other Changes

  * Bump upper bound of `tasty`.


  # 1.1.1

  ## Other Changes

  * Bump upper bound of `tasty`.


  # 1.1.0

  ## Breaking Changes

  * The XML generated is now slightly different in order to satisfy Jenkins. In
    particular:

    * The `classname` attribute now joins the test path with `.` (like a Java
      class name).
    * `testsuite` nodes have a `tests` attribute, which is the amount of tests
      executed.

    Thanks to @liskin and @haishengwu-okta for this work.

  ## Other Changes

  * Increase the lower bound of `directory` to >= 1.2.3.0. Earlier versions may
    throw exceptions on some of the actions we are using. Thanks to @liskin for
    pointing this out.


  # 1.0.5

  ## Other Changes

  * Reduce the lower bound of `filepath` to >= 1.0.0
  * Reduce the lower bound of `directory` to >= 1.0.0

  # 1.0.4

  * We now use the `classname` attribute to indicate the test group a test came from. Thanks to @haishengwu-okta for this feature.

  # 1.0.3

  * Now creates the directory containing the report XML file. Thanks to @haishengwu-okta for this feature.

  # 1.0.2
