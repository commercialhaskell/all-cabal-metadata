  # Revision history for ui

  ## 1.0.0 -- 2024-12-26

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.
changelog-type: markdown
description: The UI library provides a more modern getLine style function for making
  console based CLIs (command line interfaces). The library provides editing capabilities
  through the use of arrow keys, as well as browsing through the command history.
  It is very minimalistic, does only export two functions and doesn't require its
  own monad (only IO).
