description: |-
  This is a framework for creating commandline applications. It
  provides various features which give a polished feel to your
  application.

  It is designed to encourage you to provide clear documentation
  and working examples. It implements default ''help''
  and ''man'' commands for your application, which will layout help
  text and generate Unix-style man pages.

  It provides special handling for applications of the form
  ''program command args'', the style of interaction common in revision
  control systems. It will dispatch to handler functions that you
  provide for each command, and also provide command-specific
  help to the user.
