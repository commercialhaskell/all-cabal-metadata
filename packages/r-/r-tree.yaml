  # r-tree [![Hackage](http://img.shields.io/hackage/v/r-tree.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/r-tree)

  A Haskell library for [R-trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree) and [R\*-trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R\*-tree).

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > R-trees are self-balancing and as such can only be spine-strict.

  Featuring:

  - `Data.R2Tree.*`: two-dimensional R-tree with the R\*-tree insertion algorithm.

    `Double`-based implementation is considered the default one;
    a `Float`-based variant is provided for cases where reduced precision is preferred,
    for example rendering.

  Higher-dimensional R-trees are not currently provided,
  but should be trivial to add if needed.
