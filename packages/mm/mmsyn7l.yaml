  version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n## 0.1.0.1 -- 2020-01-07\n\n* First
  version revised A. Some documentation minor improvements. \n\n## 0.1.1.0 -- 2020-01-08\n\n*
  First version revised B. Fixed an issue with the wrong amplitude level recognition.\n\n##
  0.1.1.1 -- 2020-01-08\n\n* First version revised C. Fixed an issue with the wrong
  written function call.\n\n## 0.2.0.0 -- 2020-01-10\n\n* Second version. Added a
  possibility to use a command line argument \nobtained e. g. from the usage of mmsyn7s
  package (for more information, \nplease, refer to: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7s).\n\n##
  0.2.1.0 -- 2020-01-13\n\n* Second version revised A. Fixed issues with wrongly parsed
  sounds that are represented\nby two letters (\"дж\", \"дз\", \"сь\", \"ць\").\n\n##
  0.2.2.0 -- 2020-01-13\n\n* Second version revised B. Simplified the main function
  using the simlified version of\nthe ReplaceP mudule in the mmsyn7ukr package.\n\n##
  0.2.3.0 -- 2020-01-13\n\n* Second version revised C. Fixed an issue with the wrong
  dependency mmsyn7ukr>=0.6.2.1.\n\n## 0.3.0.0 -- 2020-01-28\n\n* Third version. Changed
  the dependency bounds. Added the support for informational messages. Some documentation
  improvements.\n\n## 0.3.1.0 -- 2020-01-28\n\n* Third version revised A. Changed

  Third version revised B. Changed README file to README.markdown.\n\n## 0.4.0.0 --
  2020-03-25\n\n* Fourth version. Added new command line option variant \"-r\" and
  changed MMSyn7l.changeVolume function. Added for this purpose a new function 'adjustVolRes'.\nAdded
  directory as an explicit dependency (earlier it has been implicit as a dependency
  for mmsyn7ukr package). Changed information in the README.markdown\nfile appropriately.\n\n##
  0.4.1.0 -- 2020-03-25\n\n* Fourth version revised A. Fixed issues with being not
  compiled for GHC 7.8.4 and for the wrong arguments specifying for 'adjustVolRes'
  function.\n\n## 0.4.2.0 -- 2020-03-25\n\n* Fourth version revised B. Fixed issue
  with wrongly specified interval to be adjusted with 'adjustVolRes' function.\n\n##
  0.4.3.0 -- 2020-05-14\n\n* Fourth version revised C. Changed bounds for the dependencies
  so that now also GHC 8.10* series are supported.\n\n## 0.5.0.0 -- 2020-05-20\n\n*
  Fifth version. From DobutokO.Sound.IntermediateF module (dobutokO2 package) some
  functions were moved here. They are in MMSyn7l module. This was \ndone to allow
  their usage without the necessity to install dobutokO2 package (just using mmsyn7*
  series). Added new fade functions to the same \nmodule using the moved ones.\n\n##
  0.6.0.0 -- 2020-05-30\n\n* Sixth version. Added two new functions to fade ends of
  the sound to MMSyn7l module. Fixed an issue with the version number in the Main.main
  function. \nSome minor code and documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.6.1.0 -- 2020-05-30\n\n*
  Sixth version revised A. Fixed issue with being not compiled because of the syntaxis.\n\n##
  0.7.0.0 -- 2020-06-24\n\n* Seventh version. Changed Double to Float in the MMSyn7l
  module so that the functons can be consistent with new dobutokO packages. Besides,
  the double precision \nis not needed and in some cases is meaningless and can potentially
  (a little bit, however) reduce performance in some cases. Some minor code and documentation
  improvements.\n\n## 0.8.0.0 -- 2020-08-16\n\n* Eighth version. Changed the dependency
  of mmsyn7ukr bounds.\n\n## 0.9.0.0 -- 2021-02-15\n\n* Ninth version. Removed vector-related
  dependencies. Some code improvements.\n\n## 0.9.1.0 -- 2022-08-16\n\n* Ninth version
  revised. Updated the dependencies to support the newer GHC-9* serios. Some minor
  \ncode improvements.\n\n## 0.9.2.0 -- 2024-12-19\n\n* Ninth version revised B. Updated
  the dependencies. Added github repository and bug-tracker.\n\n"

description: "            ***** Usage Notes *****\n            =======================\n\nFor
  the proper proceeding you specify a String, which consists of 4 \ndigits (and it
  may be preceded by a symbol \"-\"). If the String \nbegins with the \"-\", then
  a sound amplitude decreases, otherwise \nthe amplitude increases. The level of increase
  / decrease is \ndetermined by the magnitude of the absolute value of integer numbers.
  \nThe greater is the number -- the greater is the amplitude change. \nThe count
  begins with \"0000\" and ends with \"9999\" (the sign is not \ntaken into consideration).
  If there is less than 4 digits in a String, \nthen the String is equivalent to that
  one with the appropriate number \nof zeroes preceding to fulfill to the 4 needed
  digits (for example, \n\"657\" is equivalent to \"0657\", \"-2\" is equivalent to
  \"-0002\" etc.). \nIn such a case, for the Strings without the initial sign \"-\"
  (the \nsound increases) an interval between the maximum by modulus value \nof the
  amlitude (which is represented by the parts of 1) and 1.0 \nis divided into 10 equal
  parts (starting a count from 0) and then \nthat one of them is selected, which has
  a number determined by the \nfirst digit in the String writing. Then (if specified
  further) \nthe interval between this amplitude value and a value, which \ncorresponds
  to the selection on the previous step the next \nfirst digit in the writing (for
  example, after \"4\" -- \"5\", \nafter \"7\" --\"8\" etc.), greater by 1 than the
  actually selected one, \nis also divided again into 10 equal parts and that one
  is selected, \nwhich corresponds to the number determined by the second digit in
  the \nString writing (again beginning with \"0\" and ending with \"9\") and so on
  \nuntil the 4th level. The greater exactness is not needed because our \nhearing
  ability hardly distinguish such a subtle sound changes. If \nthe String has as a
  first element the \"-\" Char (the sound decreases), \nthen everything is analogously
  the same, but an interval between the \nmaximum by modulus amplitude value and 0.0
  is divided into 10 equal parts \nand so on.\n\n         ***** Command Line Arguments
  *****\n         ==================================\n         \nIf you specify a
  command line argument (other than \"-h\", \"-r\", or \"-v\"),\nit must be a sorted
  list of the Ukrainian sounds representations,\nwhich can be obtained by using the
  mmsyn7s package. For more information,\nplease, refer to:\n[mmsyn7s](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7s).\n\nIn
  such a case, the program will modify only the amplitudes for\nthose Ukrainian sounds
  representations, which are in the list.\nOtherwise, the program will modify the
  amplitudes for all non-silent Ukrainian\nsounds representations in the current directory.\n\nThe
  \"-h\" command line argument is used for the help informational message.\n\nThe
  \"-v\" command line argument is used for the version number.\n\nThe \"-r\" command
  line argument is used to work with \"result*.wav\" files to adjust\ntheir volume.
  You can additionally specify the numbers for the first and for\nthe last files to
  be adjusted.\n\n         ***** Library Functions to Edit Sound *****\n         ===========================================\n\nSince
  the 0.5.0.0 version from DobutokO.Sound.IntermediateF module (dobutokO2 package)
  \nsome functions were moved here. They are in MMSyn7l module. This was done to allow
  \ntheir usage without the necessity to install dobutokO2 package (just using mmsyn7*
  \nseries). Added new functions that use the moved ones.\n\n"
