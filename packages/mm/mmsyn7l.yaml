description: "For the proper proceeding you specify a String, which consists of 4
  \ndigits (and it may be preceded by a symbol \"-\"). If the String \nbegins with
  the \"-\", then a sound amplitude decreases, otherwise \nthe amplitude increases.
  The level of increase / decrease is \ndetermined by the magnitude of the absolute
  value of integer numbers. \nThe greater is the number -- the greater is the amplitude
  change. \nThe count begins with \"0000\" and ends with \"9999\" (the sign is not
  \ntaken into consideration). If there is less than 4 digits in a String, \nthen
  the String is equivalent to that one with the appropriate number \nof zeroes preceding
  to fulfill to the 4 needed digits (for example, \n\"657\" is equivalent to \"0657\",
  \"-2\" is equivalent to \"-0002\" etc.). \nIn such a case, for the Strings without
  the initial sign \"-\" (the \nsound increases) an interval between the maximum by
  modulus value \nof the amlitude (which is represented by the parts of 1) and 1.0
  \nis divided into 10 equal parts (starting a count from 0) and then \nthat one of
  them is selected, which has a number determined by the \nfirst digit in the String
  writing. Then (if specified further) \nthe interval between this amplitude value
  and a value, which \ncorresponds to the selection on the previous step the next
  \nfirst digit in the writing (for example, after \"4\" -- \"5\", \nafter \"7\" --\"8\"
  etc.), greater by 1 than the actually selected one, \nis also divided again into
  10 equal parts and that one is selected, \nwhich corresponds to the number determined
  by the second digit in the \nString writing (again beginning with \"0\" and ending
  with \"9\") and so on \nuntil the 4th level. The greater exactness is not needed
  because our \nhearing ability hardly distinguish such a subtle sound changes. If
  \nthe String has as a first element the \"-\" Char (the sound decreases), \nthen
  everything is analogously the same, but an interval between the \nmaximum by modulus
  amplitude value and 0.0 is divided into 10 equal parts \nand so on.\n"
