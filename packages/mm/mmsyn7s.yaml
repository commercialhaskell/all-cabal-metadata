changelog: "# Revision history for mmsyn7s\n\n## 0.1.0.0 -- 2020-01-09\n\n* First
  version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n## 0.1.1.0 -- 2020-01-10\n\n* First
  version revised A. Added a function show7s2 for the usage in the mmsyn7ukr package.\n\n##
  0.2.0.0 -- 2020-02-24\n\n* Second version. Added functions that can be used to divide
  a given text to parts with the unique Ukrainian sounds representations (except silent
  ones) and\nthe rest of the text being represented. Changed code for mmsyn7s function
  for readability. Some minor documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.3.0.0 -- 2020-02-25\n\n*
  Third version. Added README.markdown file. Added the analysis for the first command
  line argument. Added the possibility to process a Ukrainian text as a whole\nor
  alternatively by parts, each of which contains only unique String Ukrainian sounds
  representations (except for the silent ones). Some minor code and documentation\nimprovements.\n\n##
  0.3.0.1 -- 2020-02-25\n\n* Third version revised A. Improved formatting for the
  README.markdown file.\n\n## 0.3.1.0 -- 2020-02-25\n\n* Third version revised B.
  Separated the \"1\" option into two different ones: \"1\" and \"-1\", each of which
  prints either a list of Strings or the rest of the text being\ntreated partially
  till the first duplicated Ukrainian sound representation (except the silent ones).
  Improved formatting for the documentation.\n\n## 0.3.1.1 -- 2020-02-25\n\n* Third
  version revised C. Fixed issue with being not complete the \"-h\" first command
  line argument information.\n\n## 0.4.0.0 -- 2020-02-26\n\n* Fourth version. Fixed
  issue with the documentation for the 'show7s5' function. Added some new library
  functions. Added the possibility to get some statistic metrics\nand to obtain a
  list of lists of Strings -- the information about how many and what actually Ukrainian
  sounds representations are needed to be created if every sound\nrepresentation is
  unique.\n\n## 0.5.0.1 -- 2020-02-26\n\n* Fifth version revised A. Fixed issue with
  the duplicated record in the statistics. Improved formatting for the statistics
  printing by the program.\n\n## 0.5.0.2 -- 2020-02-26\n\n* Fifth version revised
  B. Fixed issue with the version number.\n\n## 0.6.0.0 -- 2020-02-28\n\n* Sixth version.
  Added packages mmsyn2 and mmsyn5 as a dependencies explicitly (earlier they wele
  as implicit dependencies because they are dependencies for\nmmsyn6ukr). Added the
  module MMSyn7.Syllable and the instruments to work with syllables. Added ghc-options
  for mmsyn7s.cabal file. Added some performance\nimprovements to the previous code.
  Some grammar issues fixed.\n\n## 0.6.1.0 -- 2020-02-28\n\n* Sixth version revised
  A. Fixed issue with the not being compiled because of the deprecated information
  in the mmsyn7s.cabal file.\n\n## 0.6.2.0 -- 2020-02-28\n\n* Sixth version revised
  B. Fixed issue with the not being compiled because of the wrong application of the
  function in the 'exceptRead' function.\n\n## 0.6.3.0 -- 2020-02-28\n\n* Sixth version
  revised C. Fixed issue with the not being compiled because of the wrong application
  of the function in the 'takeWordS' function.\n\n## 0.6.4.0 -- 2020-02-29\n\n* Sixth
  version revised D. Fixed issue with the 'notEqC' and respectively 'divideConsonants'
  functions. Added new functions to deal more with UZP datatype and so with\nclassical
  sounds in the MMSyn7.Syllable module and respectively in the MMSyn7s and Main modules.
  Changed the behaviour for \"-s2\" first command line argument\nfor mmsyn7s executable.
  Some minor documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.6.5.0 -- 2020-03-01\n\n* Sixth version
  revised E. Improved the performance of the 'main7s' function for the \"-s\" first
  command line parameter.\n\n## 0.6.5.1 -- 2020-03-01\n\n* Sixth version revised F.
  Improved formatting for the statistics printing for \"-s\" and \"-s2\" first command
  line arguments. \n\n## 0.6.6.0 -- 2020-03-08\n\n* Sixth version revised G. Changed
  the import of the datatype 'UZP' from the module MMSyn7.Syllable.\n\n## 0.6.7.0
  -- 2020-05-14\n\n* Sixth version revised H. Changed the bounds for dependencies
  so that now also GHC 8.10* series are supported.\n\n"

description: "        ***** Usage *****\n        -----------------\n\nThe package
  provides library functions and an executable. The executable\ntakes the first command
  line argument and (may be) a Ukrainian text\nbeing written without quotes as the
  next command line arguments\nand prints the sorted list of the Ukrainian sounds
  representations\n(or something equivalent, see command line arguments) that can
  be used\nfurther in mmsyn7 series of programs (or independently).\n\nDepending on
  the first command line argument the program behaves as follows:\n\n\"-h\" -- prints
  help and exits;\n\n\"-s\" -- prints some general descriptive statistics metrices
  for the given text;\n\n\"-s2\" -- prints syllable segmentation for the {number of
  words\n(or their parts) to be taken for statistics, which is a second\ncommand line
  argument} and some information about its structure\nthat can be interesting;\n\n\"-v\"
  -- prints version number and exits;\n\n\"-1\" -- prints the rest of the text after
  the first duplicated sound\nrepresentation (except silent ones) including it with
  whitespaces and\nsome phonetical conversions; \n\n\"0\"  -- prints the list of String
  for the whole text.\n\n\"1\"  -- prints the list of String being unique (without
  silence);\n\n\"2\"  -- prints the list of String for the whole text where every
  sound\nrepresentation is unique; \n\n\"3\"  -- prints the list of lists of Strings
  for the whole text, which\nshows what sounds representations are needed to be created
  if every\nsound representation is unique;\n\nAll other variants of the beginning
  for the command line arguments\nare the same as \"0\" (the arguments are treated
  as a Ukrainian text\nand processed as a whole one object).\n\n                  *****
  Syllable Segmentation *****\n                  ---------------------------------\n\nThe
  program (and the library) can be used to obtain information about\nsyllable segmentation
  of the Ukrainian text. For more information,\nplease, refer to the above information
  about the \"-s2\" first command\nline argument and to the documentation for the
  MMSyn7.Syllable module.\n\n ________________\n\nThe resulting Strings and lists
  of Strings can be used further in the\nprograms:\n\n[mmsyn7ukr](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7ukr)\n\n[mmsyn7h](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7h)\n\nThe
  results of the previous ones can be processed also by the program: \n\n[mmsyn7l](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7l)\n"
