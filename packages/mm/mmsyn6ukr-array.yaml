  ## 0.7.0.0 -- 2020-05-12

  * Seventh version. Changed the module structure (and some functions accordinly, too) to more logical and convenient for factorization and composition.
  Added a new module Melodics.Executable with the most of the Main module processment functions. Changed the behaviour of the executable
  into repeated so you can create many files with it during one runtime operation.

  ## 0.7.1.0 -- 2020-05-12

  * Seventh version revised A. Fixed issues with being not circled because of the semi-closed handles.

  ## 0.7.2.0 -- 2020-05-14

  ## 0.7.3.0 -- 2020-06-01

  * Seventh version revised C. Added Melodics.Executable.recFileName function to the export list of the module because it is re-used by the dobutokO-poetry
  package.

  ## 0.8.0.0 -- 2020-08-16

  * Eighth version. Added a new module MMSyn6Ukr.Show7s with the function from mmsyn7s module. It is done for the possible refactoring and changing the dependencies
  for other packages (first of all, mmsyn7h).

  ## 0.8.1.0 -- 2020-09-25

  * Eighth version revised A. Added to the exported functions isUkrainian from the Melodics.Ukrainian module.

  ## 0.8.2.0 -- 2020-10-28

  * Eighth version revised B. Fixed issues with some combinations that were not
  properly handled.

  ## 0.8.3.0 -- 2020-10-29

  * Eighth version revised C. Changed the dependencies boundaries. Some minor code improvements.

  ## 0.9.0.0 -- 2020-11-07

  * Ninth version. Switched to the ukrainian-phonetics-basic package (and so added it as a new dependency) as the engine of the phonetics conversions and
  representations. By this fixed some issues related to complex letter combinations. Please, update all the dependent packages related to the mmsyn6ukr
  to use the new approach.

                ***** Usage *****
                =================

  The program can be used as a special musical instrument
  or a voicing for Ukrainian text. It is not
  phonetically exact and proper, but it gives
  an inspiration to listen to the Ukrainian sounds more attentively.
  It can be used by writers (especially poets) to compose melodic
  texts. It can be used simply for the experiments. There is an
  opinion that Ukrainian is a very melodic language, so you can
  even not knowing it get some impression and get acquainted with
  this beautiful language. There are a lot of songs in it and the
  program is intended to open some part of beauty of the language itself.

  The phonetic and writing system material are from the source:
