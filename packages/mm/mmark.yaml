synopsis: Strict markdown processor for writers
changelog: |
  ## MMark 0.0.7.0

  * Added GHCJS support by making `yaml` dependency optional. With GHCJS a
    yaml block simply always returns the empty object.

  ## MMark 0.0.6.2

  * Fixed setting offset after parsing of collapsed reference links.
    Previously offset in parser state was restored incorrectly and errors that
    would happen after such links would be reported two characters before
    their real position.

  ## MMark 0.0.6.1

  * Dropped `data-default-class` dependency.

  ## MMark 0.0.6.0

  * Uses Megaparsec 7. The `parse` function now returns `ParseErrorBundle` on
    failure.

  * Dropped `parseErrorsPretty`, use `errorBundlePretty` from `megaparsec`
    instead.

  ## MMark 0.0.5.7

  * Improved parse errors related to the optional YAML block.

  ## MMark 0.0.5.6

  * Now `blockTrans` and `inlineTrans` are applied to deeply nested elements
    too, not only top-level elements.

  ## MMark 0.0.5.5

  * Fixed the bug in parser which signalled a parse error when YAML block was
    followed by more than one newline without markdown content after it.

  ## MMark 0.0.5.4

  * Empty autolinks are now disallowed. `<>` will result in literal `<>` in
    resulting HTML.

  ## MMark 0.0.5.3

  * Now HTML is escaped properly inside inline code spans.

  ## MMark 0.0.5.2

  * Fixed the bug that prevented application of rendering extensions to
    sub-blocks (blocks contained inside other blocks) and sub-inlines (inlines
    contained inside other inlines).

  ## MMark 0.0.5.1

  * The parser can now recover from block-level parse errors in tables and
    continue parsing.

  * Pipes in code spans in table cells are not considered as table cell
    delimiters anymore.

  * Table sub-parser now faster rejects inputs that do not look like a table,
    this improves overall performance.

  * Better handling of the cases when a block can be interpreted as a list and
    as a table at the same time.

  ## MMark 0.0.5.0

  * Documentation improvements.

  * Added a dummy `Show` instance for the `MMark` type.

  ## MMark 0.0.4.3

  * Compiles with `modern-uri-0.2.0.0` and later.

  ## MMark 0.0.4.2

  * Made parsing of emphasis-like markup more flexible and forgiving, see
    `README.md` for more information.

  ## MMark 0.0.4.1

  * This version uses `megaparsec-6.4.0` and `parser-combinators-0.4.0` and
    has improved performance.

  ## MMark 0.0.4.0

  * Added support for pipe tables (like on GitHub).

  * Fixed a nasty space leak in the parser, made it faster too.

  ## MMark 0.0.3.2

  * Empty strings are not parsed as URIs anymore (even though a valid URI may
    be represented as the empty string). Instead, it's now possible to write
    an empty URI using the `<>` syntax (which previously was not recognized as
    a URI in some contexts).

  * Improved parse errors related to parsing of titles in links, images, and
    reference definitions.

  * Parsing of reference definitions now can recover from failures, so the
    parser doesn't choke on malformed reference definitions anymore.

  * Reduced allocations and improved speed of the parser significantly.

  ## MMark 0.0.3.1

  * Fixed a couple of bugs in the parser for reference definitions.

  * Now link and image titles may contain newline character as per the Common
    Mark spec.

  ## MMark 0.0.3.0

  * Code can interrupt paragraphs now, as per Common Mark spec.

  * Implemented parsing of reference-links (including collapsed and
    shortcut-style links).

  * Implemented parsing of reference-style images (including collapsed and
    shortcut-style images).

  * Added support for entity and numeric references (section 6.2 of the Common
    Mark spec).

  * Improved quality of parse errors.

  ## MMark 0.0.2.1

  * Improved performance of the parser. Mainly the inline-level parser to be
    precise. The result is that now there are 3× less allocations and the code
    runs about 3× faster on paragraphs and block quotes (it's about 2.5×
    faster for a big realistic document).

  * Improved quality of parse errors.

  ## MMark 0.0.2.0

  * Now punctuation is stripped from header ids in
    `Text.MMark.Extension.headerId`.

  * Added `scannerM` in `Text.MMark.Extension` and `runScannerM` in
    `Text.MMark`.

  * Added support for block quotes.

  * Added support for unordered and ordered lists.

  ## MMark 0.0.1.1

  * Fixed a bug in skipping of headers (only one newline after the header line
    was picked, not all white space up to next block).

  ## MMark 0.0.1.0

  * Initial release.

  MMark (read “em-mark”) is a strict markdown processor for writers. “Strict”
  means that not every input is considered valid markdown document and parse
  errors are possible and even desirable, because they allow us to spot markup
  issues without searching for them in rendered document. If a markdown
  document passes MMark parser, then it'll likely produce HTML without quirks.
  This feature makes it a good choice for writers and bloggers.

  MMark in its current state features:

  * A parser that produces high-quality error messages and does not choke on
    first parse error. It is capable of reporting many parse errors where
    makes sense.

  * An extension system allowing to create extensions that alter parsed
    markdown document in some way.

  * A [`lucid`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lucid)-based render.

  There is also a blog post announcing the project:

  https://markkarpov.com/post/announcing-mmark.html

  ## Quick start: MMark vs GitHub-flavored markdown

  It's easy to start using MMark if you're used to GitHub-flavored markdown.
  There are four main differences:

  1. URIs are not automatically recognized, you must enclose them in `<` and
     `>`.

  2. Block quotes require only one `>` and they continue as long as the inner
     content is indented.

     This is OK:

     ```
     > Here goes my block quote.
       And this is the second line of the quote.
     ```

     This produces *two* block quotes:

     ```
     > Here goes my block quote.
     > And this is another block quote!
     ```

  3. HTML blocks and inline HTML are not supported.

  4. See [differences in inline parsing](#differences-in-inline-parsing).

  ## MMark and Common Mark

  MMark mostly tries to follow the Common Mark specification as given here:

  https://spec.commonmark.org/0.28/

  However, due to the fact that we do not allow inputs that do not make sense,
  and also try to guard against common mistakes (like writing `##My header`
  and having it rendered as a paragraph starting with hashes) MMark obviously
  can't follow the specification precisely. In particular, parsing of inlines
  differs considerably from Common Mark (see below).

  Another difference between Common Mark and MMark is that the latter supports
  more (pun alert) common markdown extensions out-of-the-box. In particular,
  MMark supports:

  * parsing of an optional YAML block
  * strikeout using `~~this~~` syntax
  * superscript using `^this^` syntax
  * subscript using `~this~` syntax
  * automatic assignment of ids to headers
  * pipe tables (as on GitHub)

  One does not need to enable or tweak anything for these to work, they are
  built-in features.

  ### Differences in inline parsing

  Emphasis and strong emphasis is an especially hairy topic in the Common Mark
  specification. There are 17 ad-hoc rules defining interaction between `*`
  and `_` -based emphasis and more than an half of all Common Mark examples
  (that's about 300) test just this tricky logic.

  Not only it is hard to implement, it's hard to understand for humans too.
  For example, this input:

  ```
  *(*foo*)*
  ```

  results in the following HTML:

  ```
  <p><em>(<em>foo</em>)</em></p>
  ```

  (Note the nested emphasis.)

  Could it produce something like this instead?

  ```
  <p><em>(</em>foo<em>)</em></p>
  ```

  Well, why not? Without remembering those 17 ad-hoc rules, there going to be
  a lot of tricky cases when a user won't be able to tell how markdown will be
  parsed.

  I decided to make parsing of emphasis, strong emphasis, and similar
  constructs like strikethrough, subscript, and superscript more symmetric and
  less ad-hoc. In 99% of practical cases it is identical to Common Mark, and
  normal markdown intuitions will work OK for the users.

  Let's start by dividing all characters into four groups:

  * **Space characters**, including space, tab, newline, carriage return, and
    other characters like non-breaking space.

  * **Markup characters**, including the following: `*`, `~`, `_`, `` ` ``,
    `^`, `[`, `]`. These are used for markup and whenever they appear in a
    document, they must form valid markup constructions. To be used as
    ordinary punctuation characters they must be backslash escaped.

  * **Punctuation characters**, which include all punctuation characters that
    are not **markup characters**.

  * **Other characters**, which include all characters not falling into the
    three groups described above.

  Next, let's assign *levels* to all groups but **markup characters**:

  * **Space characters**—level 0
  * **Punctuation characters**—level 1
  * **Other characters**—level 2

  When **markup characters** or **punctuation characters** are escaped with
  backslash they become **other characters**.

  We'll call **markdown characters** placed between a character of level `L`
  and a character of level `R` *left-flanking delimiter run* if and only if:

  ```
  level(L) < level(R)
  ```

  These **markup characters** sort of hang on the left hand side of a word.

  Similarly we'll call **markdown characters** placed between a character of
  level `L` and a character of level `R` *right-flanking delimiter run* if and
  only if:

  ```
  level(L) > level (R)
  ```

  These **markup characters** hang on the right hand side of a word.

  *Emphasis markup* (and other similar things like strikethrough, which we
  won't mention explicitly anymore for brevity) can start only as
  *left-flanking delimiter run* and end only as *right-flanking delimiter
  run*.

  This produces a parse error:

  ```
  *Something * is not right.
  Something __is __ not right.
  ```

  And this too:

  ```
  __foo__bar
  ```

  This means that inter-word emphasis is not supported by this approach.

  The next example is OK because `s` is an **other character** and `.` is a
  **punctuation character**, so `level('s') > level('.')`.

  ```
  Here it *goes*.
  ```

  In some rare cases backslash escaping can help get the right result:

  ```
  Here goes *(something\)*.
  ```

  We escaped the closing parenthesis `)` so it becomes an **other character**
  with level 2 and so its level is greater than the level of plain punctuation
  character `.`.

  ### Other differences

  Block-level parsing:

  * If a line starts with hash signs it is expected to be a valid *non-empty*
    header (level 1–6 inclusive). If you want to start a paragraph with
    hashes, just escape the first hash with backslash and that will be enough.
  * Setext headings are not supported for the sake of simplicity.
  * Fenced code blocks must be explicitly closed by a closing fence. They are
    not closed by the end of document or by start of another block.
  * Lists and block quotes are defined by column at which their content
    starts. Content belonging to a particular list or block quote should start
    at the same column (or greater column, up to the column where indented
    code blocks start). As a consequence of this, block quotes do not feature
    “laziness”.
  * Block quotes are started by a single `>` character, it's not necessary to
    put a `>` character at beginning of every line belonging to a quote (in
    fact, this would make every line a separate block quote).
  * Paragraphs can be interrupted by unordered and ordered lists with any
    valid starting index.
  * HTML blocks are not supported because the syntax conflicts with autolinks
    and the feature is a hack to compensate for the lack of extensibility and
    customization in the original markdown.

  Inline-level parsing:

  * MMark does not support hard line breaks represented as double space before
    newline. Nevertheless, hard line breaks in the form of backslash before
    newline are supported (these are more explicit too).
  * All URI references (in links, images, autolinks, etc.) are parsed as per
    RFC 3986, no support for escaping or support for entity and numeric
    character references is provided. In addition to that, when a URI
    reference in not enclosed with `<` and `>`, then closing parenthesis
    character `)` is not considered part of URI (use `<uri>` syntax if you
    want a closing parenthesis as part of a URI). Since the empty string is a
    valid URI and it may be confusing in some cases, we also force the user to
    write `<>` to represent the empty URI.
  * Putting links in text of another link is not allowed, i.e. no nested links
    is possible.
  * Putting images in description of other images is not allowed (similarly to
    the situation with links).
  * HTML inlines are not supported for the same reason why HTML blocks are not
    supported.

  ## About MMark-specific extensions

  * YAML block must start with three hyphens `---` and end with three hyphens
    `---`. It can only be placed at the beginning of a markdown document.
    Trailing white space after the `---` sequences is allowed.

  ## Performance

  I [have compared](https://github.com/mrkkrp/md-bench) speed and memory
  consumption of various Haskell markdown libraries by running them on an
  identical, big-enough markdown document and by rendering it as HTML:

  Library             | Parsing library     | Execution time | Allocated   | Max residency
  --------------------|---------------------|---------------:|------------:|-------------:
  `cmark-0.5.6`       | Custom C code       |       323.4 μs |     228,440 |         9,608
  `mmark-0.0.5.1`     | Megaparsec          |       7.027 ms |  26,180,272 |        37,792
  `cheapskate-0.1.1`  | Custom Haskell code |       10.76 ms |  44,686,272 |       799,200
  `markdown-0.1.16` † | Attoparsec          |       14.13 ms |  69,261,816 |       699,656
  `pandoc-2.0.5`      | Parsec              |       37.90 ms | 141,868,840 |     1,471,080

  *Results are ordered from fastest to slowest.*

  † The `markdown` library is sloppy and parses markdown incorrectly. For
  example, it parses the following `*My * text` as an inline containing
  emphasis, while in reality both asterisks must form flanking delimiter runs
  to create emphasis, like so `*My* text`. This allowed `markdown` to get away
  with a far simpler approach to parsing at the price that it's not really a
  valid markdown implementation.
