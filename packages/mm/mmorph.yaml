changelog: |
  1.2.0

  * BREAKING CHANGE: Remove instances for `ErrorT` and `ListT`
    * These types are deprecated

  1.1.5

  * Fix build failures on GHC 8.4 and 8.6
  * Add support for safe Haskell
      * Specifically, this marks the `Control.Monad.Trans.Compose` module as
        `Trustworthy`
      * The change in 1.1.4 to use `GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving` meant that the
        `Control.Monad.Trans.Compose` module was no longer inferred as safe
  * Restore `Traversable` instance removed by mistake in 1.1.4

  1.1.4 (Blacklisted)

  * Unintentional removal of `Traversable` instance for `ComposeT`
      * This missing instance is restored in 1.1.5
      * This is the reason why the 1.1.4 release is blacklisted
  * Fix `MonadFail`-related code to work for GHCJS
  * The `MonadRWS` instance for `ComposeT` has a more flexible constraint
      * The constraint is now
        `MonadReader r (f (g m)), MonadWriter w (f (g m)), MonadState s (f (g m))`
        instead of `MonadRWS r w s (f g m)`
      * This loosening of the constraint is backwards-compatible

  1.1.3

  * Add an `MFunctor` instance for `ComposeT` for GHC >= 8.6
  * Add GHC 8.8 support

  1.1.2

  * Conditionally disable `Polykinds` to support older versions of GHC

  1.1.1

  * Increase upper bound on `transformers-compat`

  1.1.0

  * BREAKING CHANGE: Enable `PolyKinds`
      * This should in theory be a non-breaking change, but due to a bug in
        GHC 8.0.1 and kind inference ambiguities I'm marking this as a breaking
        change
