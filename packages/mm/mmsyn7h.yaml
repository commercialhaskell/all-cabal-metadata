description: "The executable mmsyn7h is auxilary for the mmsyn7ukr package\n(https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmsyn7ukr).
  \nIt works similarly to the mmsyn6ukr executable, but uses the voice \nsound files
  in the current directory. This allows to change the \nneeded files and to produce
  them by some other means (e. g. by \nmmsyn7ukr).\nBesides, you can remove the created
  by mmsyn7ukr and mmsyn7h files\nwhile the last one is running, if you specified
  just one command line \nargument. \nIf you specify the second command line argument
  \"s\" and then \na list of @String@ represented the Ukrainian sounds, then \nthe
  program will use only these sounds representations \nadditionally to the default
  ones \"-.wav\", \"0.wav\" and \"1.wav\".\nIn such a case the program will not delete
  the created resulting \nsound files.\n"
