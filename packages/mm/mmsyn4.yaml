  0.1.2.0 -- 2019-10-22\n\n* First version revised C. Changed the output files scheme.
  Avoided a pipe redirection in the terminal. \n Some minor documentation and .cabal
  file improvements.\n\n## 0.1.3.0 -- 2019-12-16\n\n* First version revised D. Added
  the possibility to avoid using the at-sign in the resulting visualization file.

description: "              Usage\n              \n1. After installation the executable
  mmsyn4 is created.\n Afterwards, it is used to process files. So, open an\n  office
  spreadsheet program, e. g. LibreOffice Calc.\n2. Begin to enter the text in the
  cells. You can use\n Unicode characters. No quotation marks should be used,\n  instead
  use some special delimiter except '@' sign.\n3. Do not use colons, instead when
  needed switch to the\n nearest cell to the right. \n4. To make a text visually highlighted
  (yellowish), start\n the cell with an ’@’ sign.\n5. Lines in the table create different
  chains in the\n resulting graph. To produce an arrow to the text in the\n cell,
  enter it in the next cell in the row to the right.\n6. To make several arrows from
  the cell, switch to the\n next cell to the right for this parent one (the cell that\n
  \ will be a parent for several other cells), enter needed\n   new texts there and
  in the located below cells.\n7. Usually, you can search the needed text with Ctrl+F
  if\n needed.\n8. Empty lines in the table do not influence the resulting\n visualization.
  Above each line, except the first one,\n  there must be at least one filled cell.
  It must be\n   located above the text on the new line or even further\n    to the
  right above. Otherwise, the program will\n     produce no reasonably useful output.\n9.
  After entering all the text, export the sheet as an\n 1.csv file using colons (':')
  as separator in the working\n  directory. Otherwise, the program won’t work.\n10.
  Run the appropriate executable mmsyn4 in the terminal\n or from the command line
  while being in the directory\n  with the 1.csv file. Enter a word name of the .csv
  file\n   to be saved. DO use alphanumeric symbols and dashes if\n    needed. Then
  specify the needed splines and visualization \n     schemes by specifying the appropriate
  characters in the \n       terminal. You will specify additionally whether you\n
  \       would like to remove '@' sign from the resulting .gv\n         file and
  from the vizualization itself. Please, note \n           that if entered 'y' the
  program automatically \n            removes all the '@' from the .gv and visualization.
  \n              For more information, see the GraphViz \n                documentation.\n11.
  Your first visualization is then created. \n12. Save the spreadsheet document as
  a spreadsheet file.\n13. Repeat the steps from 2 to 12 as needed to produce\n more
  visualizations. \n14. Afterwards, you have a list of svg files, a list of .gv \n
  files as source files for Graphviz, and a list of csv\n  files, and a saved spreadsheet
  file. Then you can use\n   the produced visualizations for some other documents.\n"
