description: |-
  A modular monad transformer library, (almost) a drop-in replacement for
  the monad transformer library (mtl). It provides a uniform lifting of
  operations through any monad transformer.
  Known differences with mtl:
  - It provides a uniform lifting of operations for
  any monad transformer.
  - It does not provide a RWS monad (but you can build it yourself ;)
  - The class MonadTrans requires a new member function tmap.
  - The lifting of callCC through StateT coincides with
  the lifting in MonadLib, but not with the lifting in mtl.
