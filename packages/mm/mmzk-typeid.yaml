  # Revision history for mmzk-typeid


  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2023-07-14

  * Implement `KindID` to take arbitrary prefix type.
    * It can be a `Symbol` as before, but it can also be any type that implements
      `ToPrefix` which dictates how to translate the prefix type to a `Symbol`.

  * Fix orphan instances for `TypeID` and `KindID`.

  * Add `FromJSONKey` and `ToJSONKey` instances for `TypeID` and `KindID`.

  * Introduce `IDType` class to unify the `getPrefix`, `getUUID`, and `getTime`
    functions of `TypeID` and `KindID`.

  * Introduce `IDConv` class to unify the various conversion functions between
    `TypeID`/`KindID` and `String`/`Text`/`ByteString`.
    * The original concrete functions remain, and the class is provided as an
      alternative.

  * Deprecate `unUUID`, `parseStringWithPrefix`, `parseTextWithPrefix`,
    `parseByteStringWithPrefix`, `nil`, and `decorate`. They are either replaced
    by functions of other names or are no longer necessary.
    * They will be removed in the next major version.

  * The `UUID` type is expected to be removed in the next major version in favour
    of the type from the 'uuid-types' package.

  * More tests.


  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2023-07-11

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  * Implement TypeID as specified at https://github.com/jetpack-io/typeid.

  * Add unit tests.

  * Add type-level TypeID prefixes.

  * Add `FromJSON` and `ToJSON` instances for `TypeID` and `KindID`.

description: |-
  TypeID is a type-safe, K-sortable, globally unique identifier inspired by Stripe IDs.

  The specification is available at https://github.com/jetpack-io/typeid.

  This library supports generating and parsing speÃ§-conforming TypeIDs, with the following additional features:

  - Batch generating TypeIDs with the same 'UUID'v7 timestamp

  - Encode prefixes at type-level for better type-safety

  Please enable the following extensions if working with 'KindID':

  > {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}
  > {-# LANGUAGE PolyKinds #-}
  > {-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications #-}
  > {-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-}

  While the following is not required, it is quite convenient to have

  > {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

  For a quick "how-to-use" guide, please refer to the README.md file at https://github.com/MMZK1526/mmzk-typeid#readme.
