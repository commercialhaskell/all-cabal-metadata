description: "The program can be used as a special musical instrument \nor a voicing
  for Ukrainian text. It is not \nphonetically exact and proper, but it gives \nan
  inspiration to listen to the Ukrainian sounds more attentively.\nIt can be used
  by writers (especially poets) to compose melodic\ntexts. It can be used simply for
  the experiments. There is an\nopinion that Ukrainian is a very melodic language,
  so you can\neven not knowing it get some impression and get acquainted with\nthis
  beautiful language. There are a lot of songs in it and the \nprogram is intended
  to open some part of beauty of the language itself.\n\nThe phonetic and writing
  system material are from the source:\n\nSolomija Buk, Ján Mačutek, Andrij Rovenchak.
  Some properties of \nthe Ukrainian writing system. Electronic resource. \n<https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0802/0802.4198.pdf>\n"
