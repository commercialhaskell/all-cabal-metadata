description: "              ***** Usage *****\n              -----------------\n\nThe
  program can be used as a special musical instrument \nor a voicing for Ukrainian
  text. It is not \nphonetically exact and proper, but it gives \nan inspiration to
  listen to the Ukrainian sounds more attentively.\nIt can be used by writers (especially
  poets) to compose melodic\ntexts. It can be used simply for the experiments. There
  is an\nopinion that Ukrainian is a very melodic language, so you can\neven not knowing
  it get some impression and get acquainted with\nthis beautiful language. There are
  a lot of songs in it and the \nprogram is intended to open some part of beauty of
  the language itself.\n\nThe phonetic and writing system material are from the source:\n\n[Solomija
  Buk, Ján Mačutek, Andrij Rovenchak. Some properties of \nthe Ukrainian writing system.
