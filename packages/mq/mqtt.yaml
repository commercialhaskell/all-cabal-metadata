  A pure Haskell MQTT client and server implementation
  ====================================================

  ## Project goal

  This project aims to supply a rock-solid MQTT 3.1.1 implementation suitable for production use.

  The planned features are:

    - A broker implementation capable of handing and serving several thousands of
      connections.
    - A client implementation with integrated broker which allows one client to be
      used by several threads/consumers simultaneously.
    - TLS and WebSocket connections.
    - An interface for pluggable authentication and authorization.
    - High test and benchmark coverage.

  ## Project state (2017-03-22)

    - The broker implementation is nearly feature complete and well-tested.
      The [hummingbird](https://github.com/lpeterse/haskell-hummingbird) project
      is a full-fledged broker built on-top of this library.
    - The client implementation went out of focus for now and is currently
      commented out. It's still a planned feature and is essentially a low
      hanging fruit as all the protocol parsers etc. are already in place.
