  # Changelog

  All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

  The format is based on [Keep a Changelog][changelog], and this project adheres
  to the [Haskell Package Versioning Policy][pvp].

  ## [0.4.0.0] - Unreleased

  - Remove low-level `Process` API in favor of high-level `Server` API
  - Rename "process" to "actor" everywhere
  - Consolidate everything under `Drama` and `Drama.Internal` modules
  - Remove `Drama.Loop` module
  - Rename `run{,_}` to `runActor{,_}`
  - Rename `here` to `getSelf`
  - Make `tryReceive` indicate whether a message was received by returning a
    `Bool`
  - Add `Actor_` convenience type synonym
  - Allow using `call` with response type of `()`

    So that you can send synchronous/blocking messages that don't have a
    meaningful response. Useful if you need to wait until a message is handled
    before proceeding.
  - Send `MVar` instead of `Unagi.Chan` in `Envelope`
  - Loosened dependency version bounds

  ## [0.3.0.0] - 2021-02-23

  ### Added

  - Added `cast`, `call`, and `handle` functions, and `Envelope` message wrapper
  type, which enforce you get the response you expect from certain messages
  - Added convenient `Server` type alias for processes using `Envelope`s
  - Added `examples/use.hs` to experiment with "use pattern"
  - Moved things to separate modules (everything still re-exported from top-level
  `Drama` module)
  - Added `NoMsg`, to be used instead of `Void`

  ### Changed

  - Renamed "actor" to "process"
  - Renamed `Message` to `HasMsg`
  - Renamed `exit` to `stop`
  - Generalized `loop`, `continue`, and `stop` to any monad
  - Updated examples to use `cast` and `call` where possible
  - Improved error message for unreachable `msg ~ Void` state

  ## Fixed

  - Fixed incorrect use of `-XCPP` with `deriving newtype MonadFail`

  ## [0.2.0.0] - 2021-02-20

  ### Added

  - Added more efficient `spawn_` and `run_` functions for spawning actors that
  don't receive messages
  - Re-exported common functions and types, such as `MonadIO` and `forever`, via
  `Drama.Reexports` module

  ### Changed

  - Added `Message` constraint to functions dealing with an actor's `Address` and
  `Mailbox` (`send`, `receive`, `spawn`, etc.)

  ## [0.1.0.3] - 2021-02-20

  ### Added

  - Examples now have their own executable components, separate from the library

  ### Removed

  - Removed `SharedResource` and `Workers` modules from library

  ## [0.1.0.2] - 2021-02-20

  ### Added

  - Added examples (only compiled when `examples` flag is enabled)
  - Added `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE`, and `README.md` to `extra-source-files`

  ### Changed

  - Applied suggestions from HLint

  ### Removed

  - Removed `Drama.Demo` module

  ## [0.1.0.1] - 2021-02-19

  ### Fixed

  - Fixed build failing on GHC 8.6.5 due to missing `MonadFail` type class

  ### Changed

  - Relaxed upper bound on `transformers` library
