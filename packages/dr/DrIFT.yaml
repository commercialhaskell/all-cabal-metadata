changelog: |+
  DrIFT-2.3.0:
    * Publish DrIFT in HackageDB.
    * Get less warning message.


  DrIFT-2.2.2:
    * redid build model, collect deriving rules automatically.


  DrIFT-2.2.1:

   Mon Aug 14 19:22:26 PDT 2006  John Meacham <john@repetae.net>
    * update autotools to make autoreconf work
    * update README to reflect there no longer being a 'reconf' script
    * get rid of recursive make in docs/ subdirectory

  Thu Jan 25 21:04:02 PST 2007  John Meacham <john@repetae.net>
    * add support for Data.Binary, move old Binary to BitsBinary


  DrIFT-2.2.0:

  Mon Apr 10 00:39:24 PDT 2006  John Meacham <john@repetae.net>
    * add note about reconf script
    * make the parser handle newtype deriving without bailing out
    * fix bug in Ord deriving rule

  Wed Jan 18 03:59:21 PST 2006  David Roundy <droundy@darcs.net>
    * fix typo in src/Makefile.am

  Sun Nov 27 02:59:14 PST 2005  Malcolm.Wallace@cs.york.ac.uk
    * Change rule for Haskell2XmlNew into XmlContent, add Parse rule.
    The Haskell2XmlNew class was a temporary staging post on the way to
    developing a new XmlContent class, available in HaXml-1.14 onwards.
    This patch updates the name, and the rule, to match the latest
    developments.  It also adds support for the textual (non-XML) Parse
    class, which is an experimental replacement for the Read class, using
    monadic parser combinators.  This is also currently defined in
    HaXml-1.14.
    * docs should refer to StandardRules.hs, not .lhs
    * fix docs for Hugs usage
    * keep docs of --list option up-to-date

  Tue Nov 15 18:09:40 PST 2005  Einar Karttunen <ekarttun@cs.helsinki.fi>
    * Hook Arbitrary into DrIFT proper
    * Add UserRuleArbitrary

  Thu Nov  3 02:52:38 PST 2005  John Meacham <john@repetae.net>
    * fix data derving for new versions of ghc

  DrIFT-2.1.2:

    * fix rpm building, autoconf and some general make issues
    * fix warnings in generated binary instances
    * fix autoconf warnings

  Mon Sep 12 08:11:10 PDT 2005  Malcolm.Wallace@cs.york.ac.uk
    * support for Haskell2XmlNew
    The HaXml library Haskell2Xml has been extended to make secondary parsing
    of the generic XML content tree into a typed value more robust.  An API
    change means that a new version of the class (unimaginatively called
    Haskell2XmlNew) exists, and this patch adds the ability to generate
    parsing code for the new class.
    * doc updates
    Fix some very out-of-date statements in the manual.

  Tue May 31 16:17:12 PDT 2005  Samuel Bronson <naesten@gmail.com>
    * avoid problems with hmake by invoking ghc -M directly
    * Default to GHC to avoid NHC's tiny heap

  DrIFT-2.1.1:

  Tue Apr 19 21:09:13 PDT 2005  John Meacham <john@repetae.net>
    * Be sure to flush handles pointing to files before quitting
    * fix off-by-one line number error
    * Remove reference to genconf
    * Updated GenUtil.hs to fix nhc build


  DrIFT-2.1.0:
   * added 'get' utility which creates foo_g for each label which returns its
     value in a failing monad rather than raising an error.
   * added 'from' utility which creates fromFoo for each constructors
   * no longer an error for DERIVEPATH to not be set
   * added -i to ignore directives in file. useful with -g and -r for testing
   * added 'Query' which creates from, get, has, and is functions, but in a
     class with an instance for the data type. useful for extensible data types
   * added deriving rule for 'Monoid'
   * added code subdirectory with support code

  DrIFT-2.0.4:
   * added rule for GhcBinary
   * now allows record syntax with newtype

  DrIFT-2.0.3:
   * 'update' functions now pass through values without the specified field
   * drift-ghc script added to be used with ghc by passing -pgmF drift-ghc -F
   * documentation updated.

  DrIFT-2.0.2:
   * deriving 'update' works with newer versions of ghc
   * fixed bug in Show and Read instances

  DrIFT-2.0.1:
   * fixed many warnings in generated code
   * support for strict fields in constructors
   * support for infix constructors

  DrIFT-2.0rc4:
   * added help messages and categorization to rules
   * small isLiterate fix (TODO use nhcs deliterizer)
   * prints debug info in comment in chaseImports
   * code cleanups
   * integrated some changes from Strafunski 1.7
   * autoconf/automake improvements

  DrIFT-2.0rc3:
   * fixed version strings in generated files
   * fix dependency generation
   * fixed example test cases

  DrIFT-2.0rc2:
   * autoconf/automake added
   * texinfo is installed properly now
   * build system cleanups
   * works with both nhc and ghc again

  DrIFT-2.0rc1:
   * new texinfo documentation, based on Noel's original manual.
   * new option '-r' to only emit results and not original source
   * new option '-g' to add new global rules to apply.
   * cleaned up old non haskell98-compliant hacks

  jDrIFT-1:
   * proper GetOpt command line handling, allows you to specify an
     output file (-o) as well as list all possible derivations this
     version was compiled with (-l)
   * proper LINE pragmas in generated code
   * smarter error handling in some cases, parser smarter sometimes.
   * can deal with/ignore as appropriate some ghc extensions now
   * rules to derive Typeable used by the Dynamic library.
   * rules to derive Observable from the HOOD object debugger
   * rules to derive Term, a generic term representation for generic
     computation, can be used in a similar fashion to the Strafunski one,
     but has a number of advantages, fully lazy constant time implode/explode
     being the main one. (the external library is compatable with their work.)

  # DrIFT [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ajhc/drift.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ajhc/drift)

  This package contains a source distribution of DrIFT, a tool for automatic
  derivation of Haskell class instances. DrIFT was formerly known as Derive.

  The original homepage is at
  [http://repetae.net/john/computer/haskell/DrIFT/](http://repetae.net/john/computer/haskell/DrIFT/).
  But this DrIFT package has some changes with original DrIFT.

  ## Contents of this package:

  * src:         Directory with the source files of the DrIFT tool
  * example:     Directory with examples of using the DrIFT tool
  * docs:        Documentation

  ## How to install

  To configure and install DrIFT from the source tarball

      $ autoreconf -i
      $ ./configure
      $ make cabal-install
