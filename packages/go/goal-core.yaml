description: |
  This is the least interesting package in the Goal libraries, and serves simply
  to re-export existing libraries and provide essential utility factors in a
  manner that is compatible with Goal. Nevertheless, there are a few modules worth
  highlighting.

  **Goal.Core.Circuit**: Provides an implementation of monadic Mealy automata to
  facilitate simple stream-based processing.

  **Goal.Core.Vector.Storable**: Combines the
  [vector-sized](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-sized) and
  [hmatrix](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hmatrix) libraries to provide
  efficient linear algebra with static sizes.
