  test] runner for CLI\napplications.  You place your test cases in a directory, annotate
  them with\n`.goldplate` files, and that's it.  It is completely language agnostic.
  \ And\nperhaps its best feature is that it can automatically✨\U0001FA84 fix your
  tests outputs!\n\nGive `goldplate` a try if:\n\n -  You are testing a CLI application\n
  -  The application produces deterministic output (e.g. compilers, prettifiers,\n
  \   convertors)\n -  The application is quick to start (a process is created for
  every test)\n -  Your output is text-based and not huge in size\n\nAt [Fugue](https://fugue.co),
  we've been using internal versions of this tool\nsince 2016, so it should be pretty
  stable.\n\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n-   [Tutorial](#tutorial)\n    -   [Creating

  test\n\nImagine we are up to testing the behaviour of `echo` command.  In this very\nsimple
  example, we run `echo \"Hello, world!\"` and expect it to print `Hello,\nworld!`
  to the stdout stream as a result.\n\nCreate a new file `echo.goldplate` and add
  the following content:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"command\": \"echo\",\n    \"arguments\":
  [\"Hello, world!\"],\n    \"asserts\": [\n        {\"exit_code\": 0},\n        {\"stdout\":
  \"hello-world.txt\"}\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nLet's go through this bit by bit.\n\nThe
  test invocation is specified by the `command` and `arguments` fields.  We\nare invoking
  the `echo` process with a single argument, `\"Hello, world!\"`.\n\nThe expected
  results of our test live in the `asserts` field.  This simple test\nhas two asserts:\n\n1.
  \ We verify that the exit code is 0 (success).\n2.  We check the `stdout` (output)
  of the command against the contents of\n    the file `hello-world.txt`.\n\nWe haven't
  created `hello-world.txt` yet, but that's not a problem.  We can\ninvoke `goldplate
  --fix` to create it:\n\n    $ goldplate echo.goldplate --pretty-diff --fix\n    ...\n
  \   echo.goldplate: stdout: does not match\n    echo.goldplate: fixed ./hello-world.txt\n
  \   ...\n    Ran 1 specs, 1 executions, 2 asserts, 1 failed.\n\nAfter `hello-world.txt`
  has been created with proper contents, subsequent\n`goldplate` invocations will
  pass:\n\n    $ goldplate echo.goldplate\n    ...\n    Ran 1 specs, 1 executions,
  2 asserts, all A-OK!\n\nYou can view the full example here:\n\n -  [`tests/echo.goldplate`](tests/echo.goldplate)\n
  -  [`tests/hello-world.txt`](tests/hello-world.txt)\n\n### Feeding input on stdin\n\nView
  example:\n\n -  [`tests/cat.goldplate`](tests/cat.goldplate)\n -  [`tests/cat.stdout`](tests/cat.stdout)\n\nYou
  can pass one or multiple lines of input to the command by using the `stdin`\nfield.\n\n###
  Setting environment variables\n\nView example:\n\n -  [`tests/env.goldplate`](tests/env.goldplate)\n
  -  [`tests/env.stdout`](tests/env.stdout)\n\nThe `environment` field can be used
  to set environment variables for the\nprogram.\n\n`goldplate` also sets [a number
  of environment\nvariables](#environment-variables).  You can use these directly
  within the\nconfiguration JSON.  In this example, we use:\n\n    {\"stdout\": \"${GOLDPLATE_NAME}.stdout\"}\n\nRather
  than:\n\n    {\"stdout\": \"env.stdout\"}\n\nWe found this to be good practice,
  it makes mass-renaming of tests much easier.\n\n### Globbing input files\n\nView
  example:\n\n -  [`tests/glob.goldplate`](tests/glob.goldplate)\n -  [`tests/glob-1.txt`](tests/glob-1.txt)\n
  -  [`tests/glob-1.stdout`](tests/glob-1.stdout)\n -  [`tests/glob-2.txt`](tests/glob-2.txt)\n
  -  [`tests/glob-2.stdout`](tests/glob-2.stdout)\n\n`.goldplate` files are fairly
  small but if you have a whole directory of files\nthat you just want to run the
  same command on, they can get very repetitive.\nThis is why `goldplate` provides
  a simple way to pull in multiple input files.\n\nIf the `input_files` field is set
  to a glob, all asserts will be ran for _every_\nmatching input file.  `goldplate`
  will set the following variables:\n\n -  `${GOLDPLATE_INPUT_FILE}`: the path to
  the input file\n -  `${GOLDPLATE_INPUT_NAME}`: the input file without extension\n\n###
  Post processing: find and replace\n\nView example:\n\n -  [`tests/replace.goldplate`](tests/replace.goldplate)\n
  -  [`tests/replace.stdout`](tests/replace.stdout)\n\nSometimes you may want to do
  a find-and-replace on the actual output, for\nexample to filter out timestamps or
  other information that you do not expect to\nmatch up against the expected output.\n\n###
  Post processing: prettify JSON\n\nView example:\n\n -  [`tests/prettify-json.goldplate`](tests/prettify-json.goldplate)\n
  -  [`tests/prettify-json.json`](tests/prettify-json.json)\n\nMany modern CLI tools
  output JSON.  You can use the `prettify_json` post\nprocessor to make sure the JSON
  is converted to a normalized form with sorted\nkeys and consistent indentation.\n\n###
  Created files and directories\n\nView example:\n\n -  [`tests/create.goldplate`](tests/create.goldplate)\n
  -  [`tests/create.file`](tests/create.file)\n\n`goldplate` is geared towards checking
  the `stdout` and `stderr` outputs of a\nprogram, but you can also check that files
  were created with specific contents.\nIf you do this, `goldplate` will remove these
  files and directories afterwards\nto leave a clean repository behind.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstallation
  through source is done using standard Haskell tooling -- [Cabal]\nand [stack] both
  work well.\n\n### Using stack\n\n1.  Install [stack] for your platform.\n2.  Clone
  this repository and `cd` into it.\n3.  Run `stack install`.\n4.  Make sure `$HOME/.local/bin`
  is in your `$PATH`.\n\n### Using Cabal\n\n1.  Install [Cabal] for your platform.\n2.
  \ Clone this repository and `cd` into it.\n3.  Run `cabal install`.\n4.  Make sure
  `$HOME/.cabal/bin` is in your `$PATH`.\n\n## Reference\n\n### Syntax\n\nEnvironment
  variables can be spliced into the configuration using `${VAR}`\nsyntax within strings.
  \ To escape this syntax, use `$${VAR}` to get a literal\n`${VAR}`, `$$${VAR}` to
  get a literal `$${VAR}`, and so on.\n\n### Environment variables\n\nThe test is
  always executed in the directory that holds the `.goldplate` file.\n`goldplate`
  will always set the following environment variables:\n\n -  `GOLDPLATE_FILE`: The
  filename of the `.goldplate` file.\n -  `GOLDPLATE_NAME`: The filename of the `.goldplate`
  file _without_ the\n    extension.\n -  `GOLDPLATE_BASENAME`: The basename (filename
  without directory) of\n    the `.goldplate` file.\n\nWhen dealing with [multiple
  input files](#globbing-input-files), the following\nadditional variables are set:\n\n
  -  `GOLDPLATE_INPUT_FILE`: The input file name (relative to the current\n    directory).\n
  -  `GOLDPLATE_INPUT_NAME`: The same as `GOLDPLATE_INPUT_FILE` but without\n    the
  extension.\n -  `GOLDPLATE_INPUT_BASENAME`: The basename (filename without directory)
  of\n    the input file.\n\nHere is an example that outputs all of these environment
  variables:\n\n -  [`tests/builtin.goldplate`](tests/builtin.goldplate)\n -  [`tests/builtin.stdout`](tests/builtin.stdout)\n\n##
  Similar projects\n\nA similar project is [smoke].  I think `goldplate` has two major
  advantages\nover smoke:\n\n -  It can fix the output files automatically using `--fix`!
  \ This is very\n    useful if you make a change to your tool that affects _a lot_
  of test\n    files.  You still need to manually review the diff, but at least you
  don't\n    need to manually update the specs.\n -  You can avoid most repetitive
  configs by using\n    [simple globbing](#globbing-input-files).\n\n[Cabal]: https://www.haskell.org/cabal/\n[golden
