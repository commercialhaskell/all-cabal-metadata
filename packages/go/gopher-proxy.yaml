  ## 0.1.1.3 -- 2021-10-25

  * Support (and require) `attoparsec >= 0.14`
  * Fix parsing of the `--default-mime-type` flag: Previoulsy the
    `Read` instance was used and thus required the user to surround
    the mime type with (extra) quotes.

  ## 0.1.1.1 -- 2017-01-06

  * Add missing documentation for `--title`

  ## 0.1.1.0 -- 2017-01-06

  * Add two options: `--title` and `--server-name`
  * Fix the README on hackage
  * Elaborate the package description

  ## 0.1.0.2  -- 2017-01-05

  * Fixed a build issue

  ## 0.1.0.1  -- 2017-01-04

  * Updated package metadata

  ## 0.1.0.0  -- 2017-01-04

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  # gopher-proxy

  gopher-proxy is a tiny [wai](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai) application running on top of [warp](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/warp). It acts as a gopher-over-http proxy for a specific server, e. g. to http-ify a gopher space.

  ## Usage

  Example usage:

      gopher-proxy --host foo.org --http-port 8080

  In this particular example, gopher-proxy would proxy the `foo.org` gopher server and bind its http service on `127.0.0.1:8080` (to be proxied to by another web server like `nginx`).

  These are all optional flags which allow to change default behavior:

  * `--port`: The port of the gopher server, defaults to `70`
  * `--css-path`: Use some specific css file instead of the default one.
  * `--css-url`: The http path of the css file, defaults to `/gopher-proxy.css` (should be changed, if your gopher server has a file with the same name
  * `--base-url`: The path of the directory which will appear as root directory of gopher-proxy to the user, defaults to `/`. Should be changed if you configured your proxying web server to expose gopher-proxy as, say `/gopher-space/`.
  * `--listen-public`: If this flag is set, gopher-proxy will accept connections on its public IP address(es).
  * `--default-mime-type`: Mime type to use if gopher-proxy can't guess it, defaults to "application/octet-stream"
  * `--timeout`: connection timeout in milliseconds, defaults to 10 seconds.
  * `--server-name`: The server name of the server to proxy, defaults to the host name. This value is used to detect wether a menu item is pointing to another gopher server than the proxied one. This is particularly useful, if you use e. g. `127.0.0.1` instead of the public host name.
  * `--title`: Sets the first part of the HTML title-tag, defaults to `gopher-proxy`.

  ## Things to keep in mind

  * Your gopher server must send UTF-8-encoded gopher responses
  * gopher-proxy might misinterpret certain content, because of the context-sensitive nature of gopher
  * gopher-proxy does not support Gopher+
