description: |-
  Goatee is a Go library and game editor, written in Haskell.  It provides a
  GUI for recording, studying, and editing game records.  Underneath this is a
  portable library for manipulating SGF files to build UIs and tools.  Goatee
  aims to be full-featured by supporting all of the SGF spec and allowing for
  full and easy customization of the game records you create.

  This package is the shared library.
