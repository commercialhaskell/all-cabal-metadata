  ## 0.2.1 (2021-06-23)

  #### Changed

  - Performance improvement when using GHC 9.

  ## 0.2.0 (2020-10-26)

  **Note:** The deprecations added in `0.1.7` have _not_ been removed in this
  version. Instead of `0.1.7`, that release should have been `0.2` in the first
  place.

  #### Added

  - Add missing exports of `zipWithStream`, `materialize`, and `dematerialize`.

  #### Changed

  - **Breaking:** Switched names of `fold` and `fold_` in the non-`Char8` modules.
    The corresponding `Char8` functions and the rest of the library uses `_` for
    the variant that forgets the `r` value.
  - **Breaking:** Unified `nextByte`/`nextChar` with `uncons`. The old `uncons`
    returned `Maybe` instead of the more natural `Either r`.
  - **Breaking:** Similarly, `unconsChunk` and `nextChunk` have been unified.
  - `nextByte`, `nextChar`, and `nextChunk` have been deprecated.
  - Relaxed signature of `toStrict_` to allow any `r`, not just `()`.
  - Permance improvements for `packChars` and `denull`.
  - Various documentation improvements.
  - Improved performance of `w8IsSpace` to more quickly filter out non-whitespace
    characters, and updated `words` to use it instead of the internal function
    `isSpaceWord8` from the `bytestring` package. See also
    [bytestring#315](https://github.com/haskell/bytestring/pull/315).

  #### Fixed

  - An edge case involving overflow in `readInt`.
  - A potential crash in `uncons`.
  - `intersperse` now ignores any initial empty chunks.
  - `intercalate` now does not insert anything between the final substream and the
    outer stream end.
  - `unlines` now correctly handles `Chunk "" (Empty r)` and `Empty r`.

  ## 0.1.7 (2020-10-14)

  Thanks to Viktor Dukhovni and Colin Woodbury for their contributions to this release.

  #### Added

  - The `skipSomeWS` function for efficiently skipping leading whitespace of both
    ASCII and non-ASCII.

  #### Changed

  - **The `ByteString` type has been renamed to `ByteStream`**. This fixes a
    well-reported confusion from users. An alias to the old name has been provided
    for back-compatibility, but is deprecated and be removed in the next major
    release.
  - **Modules have been renamed** to match the precedent set by the main
    `streaming` library. Aliases to the old names have been provided, but will be
    removed in the next major release.
    - `Data.ByteString.Streaming` -> `Streaming.ByteString`
    - `Data.ByteString.Streaming.Char8` -> `Streaming.ByteString.Char8`
  - An order-of-magnitude performance improvement in line splitting. [#18]
  - Performance and correctness improvements for the `readInt` function. [#31]
  - Documentation improved, and docstring coverage is now 100%. [#27]

  #### Fixed

  - An incorrect comment about `Handle`s being automatically closed upon EOF with
    `hGetContents` and `hGetContentsN`. [#9]
  - A crash in `group` and `groupBy` when reading too many bytes. [#22]
  - `groupBy` incorrectly ordering its output elements. [#4]

  # streaming-bytestring

  [![Build](https://github.com/haskell-streaming/streaming-bytestring/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/haskell-streaming/streaming-bytestring/actions)
  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/haskell-streaming/streaming-bytestring.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/haskell-streaming/streaming-bytestring)
  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/streaming-bytestring.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming-bytestring)

  This library enables fast and safe streaming of byte data, in either `Word8` or
  `Char` form. It is a core addition to the [`streaming`
  ecosystem](https://github.com/haskell-streaming/) and avoids the usual pitfalls
  of combinbing lazy `ByteString`s with lazy `IO`.

  This library is used by
  [`streaming-attoparsec`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming-attoparsec)
  to enable vanilla [Attoparsec](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/attoparsec)
  parsers to work with `streaming` "for free".

  ## Usage

  ### Importing and Types

  Modules from this library are intended to be imported qualified. To avoid
  conflicts with both the `bytestring` library and `streaming`, we recommended `Q`
  as the qualified name:

  ```haskell
  import qualified Streaming.ByteString.Char8 as Q
  ```

  Like the `bytestring` library, leaving off the `Char8` will expose an API based
  on `Word8`. Following the philosophy of `streaming` that "the best API is the
  one you already know", these APIs are based closely on `bytestring`. The core
  type is `ByteStream m r`, where:

  - `m`: The Monad used to fetch further chunks from the "source", usually `IO`.
  - `r`: The final return value after all streaming has concluded, usually `()` as in `streaming`.

  You can imagine this type to represent an infinitely-sized collection of bytes,
  although internally it references a **strict** `ByteString` no larger than 32kb,
  followed by monadic instructions to fetch further chunks.

  ### Examples

  #### File Input

  To open a file of any size and count its characters:

  ```haskell
  import Control.Monad.Trans.Resource (runResourceT)
  import qualified Streaming.Streaming.Char8 as Q

  -- | Represents a potentially-infinite stream of `Char`.
  chars :: ByteStream IO ()
  chars = Q.readFile "huge-file.txt"

  main :: IO ()
  main = runResourceT (Q.length_ chars) >>= print
  ```

  Note that file IO specifically requires the
  [`resourcet`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/resourcet) library.

  #### Line splitting and `Stream` interop

  In the example above you may have noticed a lack of `Of` that we usually see
  with `Stream`. Our old friend `lines` hints at this too:

  ```haskell
  lines :: Monad m => ByteStream m r -> Stream (ByteStream m) m r
  ```

  A stream-of-streams, yet no `Of` here either. The return type can't naively be
  `Stream (Of ByteString) m r`, since the first line break might be at the very
  end of a large file. Forcing that into a single strict `ByteString` would crash
  your program.

  To count the number of lines whose first letter is `i`:

  ```haskell
  countOfI :: IO Int
  countOfI = runResourceT
    . S.length_                   -- IO Int
    . S.filter (== 'i')           -- Stream (Of Char) IO ()
    . S.concat                    -- Stream (Of Char) IO ()
    . S.mapped Q.head             -- Stream (Of (Maybe Char)) IO ()
    . Q.lines                     -- Stream (ByteStream IO) IO ()
    $ Q.readFile "huge-file.txt"  -- ByteStream IO ()
  ```

  Critically, there are several functions which when combined with `mapped` can
  bring us back into `Of`-land:

  ```haskell
  head     :: Monad m => ByteStream m r -> m (Of (Maybe Char) r)
  last     :: Monad m => ByteStream m r -> m (Of (Maybe Char) r)
  null     :: Monad m => ByteStream m r -> m (Of Bool) r)
  count    :: Monad m => ByteStream m r -> m (Of Int) r)
  toLazy   :: Monad m => ByteStream m r -> m (Of ByteString r) -- Be careful with this.
  toStrict :: Monad m => ByteStream m r -> m (Of ByteString r) -- Be even *more* careful with this.
  ```

  When moving in the opposite direction API-wise, consider:

  ```haskell
  fromChunks :: Stream (Of ByteString) m r -> ByteStream m r
  ```
