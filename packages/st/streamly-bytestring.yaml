  # streamly-bytestring

  Library for streamly and bytestring interoperation.

  If you are writing code from scratch, please use `Streamly.Data.Array.Foreign`
  which is a generalization of `ByteString` and better integrated with streamly.

  This library is to enable interoperation of streamly with existing code that
  uses `ByteString`.

  The package provides APIs to interconvert between strict `Bytestring` and
  streamly `Array Word8` and between lazy `Bytestring` and stream of `Array
  Word8`.

  The interconversion in the case of strict `Bytestring` and streamly `Array
  Word8` has no overhead as the underlying representation of ByteString and Array
  are the same, we just need to rewrap the data in a different type.

  ## Usage

  This is a dumb program that counts the number of bytes in a file.

  ```
  import qualified Streamly.Prelude as S

  import qualified Data.ByteString as BS
  import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as BSL

  import qualified Streamly.External.ByteString as Strict
  import qualified Streamly.External.ByteString.Lazy as Lazy

  import System.IO (FilePath)

  strictByteStringSize :: BS.ByteString -> IO Int
  strictByteStringSize bs = S.length $ S.unfold Strict.read bs

  lazyByteStringSize :: BSL.ByteString -> IO Int
  lazyByteStringSize bsl = S.foldl' (+) 0
                           $ S.mapM strictByteStringSize
                           $ S.map Strict.fromArray
                           $ Lazy.toChunks bsl

  fileSize :: FilePath -> IO Int
  fileSize path = do
      bsl <- BSL.readFile path
      lazyByteStringSize bsl
  ```
