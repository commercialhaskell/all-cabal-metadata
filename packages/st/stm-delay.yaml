description: |-
  This library lets you create a one-shot timer, poll it using STM,
  and update it to ring at a different time than initially specified.

  It uses GHC event manager timeouts when available
  (GHC 7.2+, @-threaded@, non-Windows OS), yielding performance similar
  to @threadDelay@ and @registerDelay@.  Otherwise, it falls back to
  forked threads and @threadDelay@.

  [0.1.1]
  Add tryWaitDelayIO, improve performance for certain cases of @newDelay@
  and @updateDelay@, and improve example.
