description: |-
  While tinkering on a project, I frequently found myself
  wanting to wait for an IO operation /unless/ something
  more important came up. The "Control.Concurrent.STM.OrElseIO"
  module is meant to reduce the boilerplate needed when choosing
  between IO actions and STM operations.

  You must use the threaded runtime with this package.

  TODO:

  * Kill off IO threads whose return values will never be needed.

  * Possibly rename @runOrElse@ and friends to @orElseIO@ or similar.
