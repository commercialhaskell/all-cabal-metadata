description: |-
  This library provides a purely functional implementation of
  stable heaps (fair priority queues). The data structure is a
  cousin of the pairing heap which maintains a sequential
  ordering of the keys. Insertion can be to either end of the
  heap, as though it is a deque, and it can be split on the
  left-most occurrence of the minimum key.

  The current state of the package is fairly barebones. It will
  be fleshed out later.
