  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/stackage-curator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/stackage-curator)


  This repository contains the code for curating Stackage package sets and

  building reusable package databases. It was originally simply called the

  stackage package and was part of the stackage repository, but since this is a

  tool very few people need to use, we split it into its own package with a name

  to indicate it''s limited usage (curators only).


  More information on Stackage:

  ### Code explanation


  We start off with *constraints*. Constraints state things like "package X has a

  given version range," who the maintainer is for a package, the description of

  the system/compiler being used, etc. `BuildConstraints` describes the build as

  a whole, whereas `PackageConstraints` describes the constraints on an

  individual package.


  There are two primary ways of getting a `BuildConstraints`.

  `defaultBuildConstraints` inspects the first GHC in the PATH environment variable
  to

  determine GHC version, core packages, core tools, etc. It then uses the

  `Stackage.Config` module to extract information on additional packages to be

  installed. The secondary approach is in `Stackage2.UpdateBuildPlan`, which will
  be

  discussed later.


  `BuildConstraints` does not specify a build completely. That is given by a

  `BuildPlan`, which is similarly broken down into `BuildPlan` and `PackagePlan`.

  In order to get a `BuildPlan`, we need two pieces of information: the

  `BuildConstraints`, and a package index. The package index (usually downloaded

  from Hackage) is a collection of all of the cabal files available.


  By applying a `BuildConstraints` to a package index (via `newBuildPlan`), we

  get a proposed `BuildPlan`. There is no guarantee that this `BuildPlan` is

  valid. To validate it, we use `checkBuildPlan`. A `BuildPlan` is an instance of

  both `ToJSON` and `FromJSON`, and therefore can be serialized to a file for

  later use.


  When dealing with LTS Haskell, we want to be able to take a `BuildPlan`, and

  update to a newer `BuildPlan` that keeps all packages at the same major

  version.  `updateBuildConstraints` turns a `BuildPlan` into a new

  `BuildConstraints` with that restriction, and `updateBuildPlan` applies

  `newBuildPlan` to that result. As mentioned previously: this is *not* a

  validated result, and therefore `checkBuildPlan` must be used.


  A `BuildPlan` can be acted on. This is done to check that all packages compile

  together, run relevant test suites, test Haddock documentation is correct, and

  produce as artifacts both a self-contained GHC binary package database and a

  set of Haddock documentation. (Not yet implemented.)


  A `BuildPlan` may be converted into a bundle to be uploaded to Stackage Server.

  (Not yet implemented.)
