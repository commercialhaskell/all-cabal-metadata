  # strongswan-sql
  #### Configuration of StrongSwan SQL backend

  This library allows for the manipulation of strongSwan connection configuration stored in a
  MySQL database in a manner that is compatible with the strongSwan SQL plugin for charon.

  * How to use this module:

  The strongSwan IPsec package offers the means to store connection configuration in a
  SQL database. This module offers some facilities to manipulate these config elements
  from Haskell code in a simplified abstracted way.
  This library offers two approaches to manipulating strongswan configuration in an
  SQL database as expected by the SQL plugin. See _Managed_ vs _Manual_ API below.

  * Managed API
  Since managing each configuration object per hand and establishing the relationships
  amongst them can be tricky and demands internal knowledge of the SQL plugin inner workings,
  a special API is offered in which all configuration parameters are bundled together
  in a single type (see `IPSecSettings`). The simplified API allows then for writing, reading
  and deleting these, while behind bars the required elements are created and linked
  together unbeknownst to the caller. This of course greatly simplifies things /but/ the
  catch is that the ability to share configuration elements amongst connections is of
  course lost. Each managed connection configuration gets a separate IKE, Child SA, Peer
  config etc and no attempt is made to reuse them amongst managed connections.

  * Manual API

  The different strongswan configuration elements are mapped to a Haskell type and they
  can be manually written or read from the SQL database. This offers utmost control in
  terms of what elements get created and how they are interlinked. So for example one can
  create a single IKE session configuration to be shared for all connections or have some
  child SA configurations being shared amongst peers of a given type, etc. The downside
  of course to this level of control is that it requires for the user of the library to be familiar with the (poorly documented) way in which the plugin expects the relationships to be expressed in terms of entries in the SQL tables etc.

  The manual API has been reverse engineered based on the SQL table definitions available
  [here](https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/repository/entry/src/pool/mysql.sql)

  * __Child SA__ : All configuration parameters related to an IPsec SA.
  * __IKE Configuration__ : Configuration applicable to the IKE session (/phase 1/ in IKEv1
  parlance).
  * __Peer Configuration__ : All elements related to configuration of a peering connection.
  A peer connection links to a specific IKE configuration (by means of ID), and it is
  furthermore associated to the Child SA by means of a `Peer2ChildConfig` type.
  * __Traffic Selectors__: These are independent values linked to a Child SA by means of a
  `Child2TSConfig` type.
