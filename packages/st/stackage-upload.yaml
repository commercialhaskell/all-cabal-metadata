  # stackage-upload

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/stackage-upload.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/stackage-upload)

  `stackage-upload` provides a more secure version of the `cabal upload` command
  by using HTTPS. When uploading a package to Hackage, `cabal upload` will
  perform the upload in plain-text via unencrypted HTTP, using [basic
  authentication](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/blob/2b3a69490a2dbd6dfa3905b8a50ebad8aec7b276/cabal-install/Distribution/Client/Upload.hs#L56),
  which is vulnerable to both man in the middle (MITM) and eavesdropping attacks
  (anyone sniffing your packets can get your username and password). This package
  instead uses secure HTTPS to upload to avoid both of these attacks.

  To install, simply run `cabal update && cabal install stackage-upload`. Usage
  is quite similar to  `cabal upload`: just call `stackage-upload` and pass in a list
  of tarballs to upload. (If you have
  [stackage-cli](https://github.com/fpco/stackage-cli) installed, you can call
  `stk upload` instead.) `stackage-upload --help` will provide full options.

  ## Why not fix cabal?

  I'd be happy to add TLS support to cabal-install directly (using Vincent's
  `tls` package), but the two last times this topic came up, I have been unable
  to find a proposal that is acceptable to the Cabal project (mostly around
  Haskell Platform requirements). I made an open offer to send the pull request
  myself to move cabal-install over to http-client to get TLS support (either via
  http-client-tls or http-client-openssl).

  ## Why Stackage?

  See [the same question and its answer on stackage-update](https://github.com/fpco/stackage-update#why-stackage).

  ## Future enhancements

  * Store passwords securely via GPG encryption
  * Upload documentation to Hackage (work around the sometimes-broken doc builder)
  * Perform pre-upload checks, such as running the test suite from the tarball to check for missing files

  ## History

  This tool was something that I (Michael Snoyman) wrote for myself a while back,
  and decided to rebrand as `stackage-upload` when the severity of the insecure
  upload situation became apparent to me, and it became obvious that there was no
  path forward for getting `cabal-install` fixed.

  I actually consider this situation to be so dangerous that I would like to ask the
  Hackage Server team to consider turning off insecure uploads to Hackage. The
  current possibility for corrupted uploads to infect all users of a package is
  alarmingly high.
