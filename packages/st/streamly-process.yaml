  # Changelog

  ## 0.3.1 (Dec 2023)

  * Allow streamly-0.10.0 and streamly-core-0.2.0
  * Fix a bug in quote escaping in the Command module
  * Add APIs in System.Process and System.Command module with ability to set
    process attributes.

  ## 0.3.0 (Apr 2023)

  * Added a `Streamly.System.Command` module
  * `toChunks` and `toBytes` now make the stdin available to the process being
    executed.
  * Allow streamly 0.9.0
  * Signature changes - removed the IsStream constraint, now all APIs use the
    monomorphic `Stream` type.

  ## 0.2.0.1 (Mar 2022)

  * Fix the test suite.
  * Allow streamly 0.8.2

  ## 0.2.0 (Dec 2021)

  * The process in following APIs is now terminated with SIGTERM if an exception
    is thrown or if the process is garbage collected before it could terminate.
    - `toBytes`
    - `processChunks`
    - `processBytes`

  ## 0.1.0 (Jul 2021)

  * Initial version.

  # OS processes as streams

  Use operating system (OS) commands in Haskell programs as if they were
  native Haskell functions, by treating their inputs and outputs as
  Haskell streams. This allows you to write high-level Haskell scripts
  that can perform tasks similar to shell scripts, but with C-like
  performance, and with strong safety guarantees, refactorability, and
  modularity.

  Use the following imports in the examples below:

  ```haskell
  >>> :set -XFlexibleContexts
  >>> :set -XScopedTypeVariables
  >>> :set -XQuasiQuotes
  >>> import Data.Function ((&))
  >>> import Streamly.Unicode.String (str)
  >>> import qualified Streamly.Data.Array as Array
  >>> import qualified Streamly.Console.Stdio as Stdio
  >>> import qualified Streamly.Data.Fold as Fold
  >>> import qualified Streamly.Data.Stream.Prelude as Stream
  >>> import qualified Streamly.System.Command as Command
  >>> import qualified Streamly.Internal.FileSystem.Dir as Dir
  ```

  ## Commands as streaming functions

  The shell command `echo "hello world" | tr [a-z] [A-Z]` can be written as
  follows using this package:

  ```haskell
  >>> :{
     Command.toBytes [str|echo "hello world"|] -- Stream IO Word8
   & Command.pipeBytes [str|tr [a-z] [A-Z]|]   -- Stream IO Word8
   & Stream.fold Stdio.write                   -- IO ()
  :}
  HELLO WORLD
  ```

  ## Shell commands as streaming functions

  If you want to execute the same command using the shell pipe syntax:

  ```haskell
  >>> :{
     Command.toBytes [str|sh "-c" "echo 'hello world' | tr [a-z] [A-Z]"|] -- Stream IO Word8
   & Stream.fold Stdio.write                                              -- IO ()
  :}
  HELLO WORLD
  ```

  ## Running Commands Concurrently

  You can run commands concurrently by using streamly's concurrent combinators.

  Running @grep@ concurrently on many files:

  ```haskell
  >>> :{
  grep file =
     Command.toBytes [str|grep -H "pattern" #{file}|]             -- Stream IO Word8
   & Stream.handle (\(_ :: Command.ProcessFailure) -> Stream.nil) -- Stream IO Word8
   & Stream.foldMany (Fold.takeEndBy (== 10) Array.write)         -- Stream IO (Array Word8)
  :}

  >>> :{
  pgrep =
     Dir.readFiles "."             -- Stream IO FilePath
   & Stream.parConcatMap id grep   -- Stream IO (Array Word8)
   & Stream.fold Stdio.writeChunks -- IO ()
  :}
  ```
