  # Changelog

  ## 0.2.1 (Dec 2023)

  * Make the serialization of the unit constructor deterministic.
  * Expose `pinnedSerialize` & `deserialize` via `Streamly.Data.Array`.

  ## 0.2.0 (Nov 2023)

  See [0.1.0-0.2.0 API Changelog](https://github.com/composewell/streamly/blob/streamly-0.10.0/core/docs/ApiChangelogs/0.1.0-0.2.0.txt)
  for a full list of API changes in this release. Only a few significant
  changes are mentioned here.

  ### Breaking Changes

  * `ParserK` in `Streamly.Data.ParserK` is not implicitly specialized
    to arrays anymore. To adapt to the new code, change `ParserK a m
    b` to `ParserK (Array a) m b` where the `Array` type comes from
    `Streamly.Data.Array`. This change also affected the signatures of
    `parseChunks` and `parseBreakChunks`.
  * Changed the signature of 'Streamly.Data.Stream.handle' to make the
    exception handler monadic.
  * Behavior change: Exceptions are now rethrown promptly in `bracketIO`.

  ### Enhancements

  * __Serialization__: Added a `Streamly.Data.MutByteArray` module with a
    `Serialize` type class for fast binary serialization. The Data.Array
    module supplies the `serialize` and `deserialize` operations for arrays.
  * __Unpinned Arrays__: Unboxed arrays are now created unpinned by default,
    they were created pinned earlier. During IO operations, unpinned arrays
    are automatically copied to pinned memory. When arrays are directly
    passed to IO operations programmers can choose to create them pinned to
    avoid a copy.  To create pinned arrays, use the internal APIs with the
    `pinned*` prefix.
  * StreamK now supports native exception handling routines (handle, bracketIO).
    Earlier we had to convert it to the `Stream` type for exception handling.

  ### Deprecations

  See [0.1.0-0.2.0 API Changelog](https://github.com/composewell/streamly/blob/streamly-0.10.0/core/docs/ApiChangelogs/0.1.0-0.2.0.txt)
  for a full list of deprecations.

  ### Internal API Changes

  * Fold constructor has changed, added a `final` field to support
    finalization and cleanup of a chain of folds. The `extract` field is
    now used only for mapping the fold internal state to fold result for
    scanning purposes. If your fold does not require cleanup you can just use
    your existing `extract` function as `final` as well to adapt to this change.
  * Many low level internal modules have been removed, they are entirely
    exported from higher level internal modules. If you were importing any
    of the missing low level modules then import the higher level modules instead.
  * Internal module changes:
    * Streamly.Internal.Serialize.FromBytes -> Streamly.Internal.Data.Binary.Parser
    * Streamly.Internal.Serialize.ToBytes ->   Streamly.Internal.Data.Binary.Stream
    * Streamly.Internal.Data.Unbox is now exported via Streamly.Internal.Data.Serialize
    * Streamly.Internal.Data.IORef.Unboxed is now exported via Streamly.Internal.Data.Serialize

  ## 0.1.0 (March 2023)

  Also see [streamly-core-0.1.0 API Changelog](https://github.com/composewell/streamly/blob/streamly-0.10.0/core/docs/ApiChangelogs/0.1.0.txt) or
  https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streamly-core-0.1.0/docs/docs/ApiChangelogs/0.1.0.txt

  `streamly` package is split into two packages, (1) `streamly-core` that
  has only GHC boot library depdendecies, and (2) `streamly` that contains
  higher level operations (including concurrent ones) with additional
  dependencies.

  * Moved the following modules from `streamly` package to the
    `streamly-core` package:
    * Streamly.Console.Stdio
    * Streamly.Data.Fold
    * Streamly.Data.Unfold
    * Streamly.FileSystem.Handle
    * Streamly.Unicode.Stream
  * Added the following new modules:
    * Streamly.Data.Array
    * Streamly.Data.Array.Generic
    * Streamly.Data.MutArray
    * Streamly.Data.MutArray.Generic
    * Streamly.Data.Parser
    * Streamly.Data.ParserK
    * Streamly.Data.Stream
    * Streamly.Data.StreamK
    * Streamly.FileSystem.Dir
    * Streamly.FileSystem.File
    * Streamly.Unicode.Parser
    * Streamly.Unicode.String

  For upgrading to streamly-0.9.0+ please read the
  <https://github.com/composewell/streamly/blob/streamly-0.10.0/docs/User/Project/Upgrading-0.8-to-0.9.md Streamly-0.9.0 upgrade guide>.

  Streamly is a standard library for Haskell that focuses on C-like
  performance, modular combinators, and streaming data flow model.
  Streamly consists of two packages: "streamly-core" and "streamly".
  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streamly-core streamly-core>
  provides basic features, and depends only on GHC boot libraries (see
  note below), while
  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streamly streamly> provides
  higher-level features like concurrency, time, lifted exceptions,
  and networking. For documentation, visit the
  <https://streamly.composewell.com Streamly website>.

  The streamly-core package provides the following functionality:

  * Streams as composable producers of a sequence of values.
  * Streams provide all the functionality provided by Haskell lists but
  in an effectful, streaming fashion with better performance.
  * Streams provide ListT and logic programming functionality as well.
  * Folds as composable stream consumers that reduce the streams to a
  single value or reduce segments of streams to transform the stream.
  * Parsers as more powerful, composable stream consumers supporting
  standard parser combinators with backtracking but in a streaming
  fashion.
  * Arrays with streaming interfaces providing high performance,
  modularity, and concise interface as all streaming operations can be
  performed on arrays.
  * Arrays can be immutable or mutable, unboxed or boxed, pinned or
  unpinned.
  * Arrays generalize the functionality provided by @bytestring@ and
  @text@ packages.
  * Interoperability with @bytestring@ and @text@ is
  provided via separate packages.
  * Arrays and folds provide natural builder functionality so there are no
  separate builder modules.
  * High performance binary serialization with configurable JSON like features.
  * Streaming combinators for unicode text processing, providing
  functionality equivalent to the @text@ package.
  * String interpolation for convenient construction of strings.
  * Streaming console IO (stdin/stdout) operations.
  * Streaming file and directory IO operations.

  This package covers some or all of the functionality covered
  by @streaming, pipes, conduit, list-t, logic-t, foldl, attoparsec,
  array, primitive, vector, vector-algorithms, binary, cereal, store,
  bytestring, text, stringsearch, interpolate@. Streamly provides a
  consistent, concise, modular and performant interface for all this
  functionality.

  Note: The dependencies "heaps" and "monad-control" are included in
  the package solely for backward compatibility, and will be removed in
  future versions.
