  Stacked
  =======

  _The modern indexed monad stack_

  Stacked is an indexed monad (see _e.g._ [this description by Conor
  McBride][mcbride-ixmonad]) library built from the ground up to use modern GHC
  features (such as qualified do and quantified constraints).

  For instance

  - The monad hierarchy follows that of base with for instance `Applicative` and
    `Monad`. These don't use distinctive names `IxApplicative`, `IxMonad`, or
    `ixBind`: they use the standard `Applicative`, `Monad`, and `(>>=)` names from
    base, and are meant to be imported qualified, and typically use with the
    [qualified do notation][qualified-do].
  - But there is no indexed functor class defined in this library because, thanks
    to quantified constraints, the standard functor class suffices. The functor
    super-class for indexed applicative looks like `(forall i j. Functor f i j) =>
    …`
  - We also take the opportunity of growing the stack from scratch to define a
    single `Additive` class to replace `Alternative` and `MonadPlus`. We then
    define `Alternative` as
    ```haskell
    type Alternative m = (Applicative m, forall r r' a. Additive (m r r' a))
    ```
    Which uses both quantified constraints and impredicative types.

  The library is meant to feel familiar to Haskell programmers, despite the
  clean-ups that modern Haskell affords.

  ## Points of interest

  - Stacked has a rich sublibrary on continuation indexed monads and their
    relation with delimited control. This part of the library was developed to
    serve the needs of the [Pup library][pup].
