  # Revision history for streaming-with

  ## 0.3.0.0 -- 2021-08-29

  * Support newer version of `streaming-bytestring` and GHC.

  ## 0.2.2.1 -- 2018-05-23

  * Bump temporary dependency

  ## 0.2.2.0 -- 2018-05-23

  * Actually export `liftThrow` from within `Streaming.With.Lifted`.

  ## 0.2.1.1 -- 2018-03-23

  * Bump exceptions dependency

  ## 0.2.1.0 -- 2018-02-06

  * Add the `RunWithable` class.

  * Add the `within`, `liftActionIO` and `liftThrow` functions for use
    with `Withable`.

  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2017-07-07

  * Add `Monad w` constraint to `Withable w`

      - This was the intended use case all along, with the intent that
        you can write code generic in the choice of `w`.

  ## 0.1.1.0 -- 2017-07-07

  * Add support for the [temporary] package, specifically the functions:

      * `withSystemTempFile`
      * `withTempFile`
      * `withSystemTempDirectory`
      * `withTempDirectory`

      [temporary]: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/temporary

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2017-06-30

  * First release.

  > with/bracket-style idioms for use with [streaming]

  This library provides resource management for the [streaming]
  ecosystem of libraries using bracketed continuations.

  [streaming]: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming

  Currently, these only contain file-handling utilities; if you can
  think of any more functions that fit in here please let me know!

  There are two ways of using this library:

  1. Explicitly pass around the continuations using `Streaming.With`.

  2. If you have a lot of nested continuations, you may prefer using
     `Streaming.With.Lifted` with either [`ContT`] or [managed]; these
     will allow you to pass around the parameters to the continuations.

  [`ContT`]: http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/transformers/latest/doc/html/Control-Monad-Trans-Cont.html#v:ContT
  [managed]: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/managed

  Motivation
  ----------

  The streaming library has some usages of `MonadResource` from the
  [resourcet] package to try and perform resource allocation; in
  comparison to `conduit` however, streaming doesn't support prompt
  finalisation.  Furthermore, because in may ways `Conduit`s can be
  considered to be a datatype representing monadic functions between two
  types whereas a single `Stream` is more akin to a producing-only
  `Conduit` or `Pipe`, attempts at having something like `readFile` that
  returns a `Stream` does not always lead to the resource being closed
  at the correct point.  The consensus in the issue for [promptness for
  streaming] was that perhaps relying upon `MonadResource` was not the
  correct approach.

  [promptness for streaming]: https://github.com/michaelt/streaming/issues/23


  The [Bracket pattern] (also known as the _with..._ idiom, or a subset
  of continuation passing style) allows for a convenient way to obtain
  and then guarantee the release of (possibly scarce) resources.  This
  can be further enhanced when dealing with nested usages of these with
  the use of either the [`ContT`] managed transformer or the [managed]
  library (where `Managed` -- or at least its safe variant -- is
  isomorphic to `ContT () IO`).

  [Bracket pattern]: https://wiki.haskell.org/Bracket_pattern

  The biggest downside of using `bracket` from the standard `base`
  library is that the types are not very convenient in the world of
  monad transformers: it is limited to `IO` computations only, which
  means for our use of streaming that we could only use `Stream f IO r`
  without any state, logging, etc.  However, the [exceptions] library
  contains a more general purpose variant that provides us with extra
  flexibility; it doesn't even need to be in `IO` if you have a
  completely pure `Stream`! (A variant is also available in
  [lifted-base], but it is less used and streaming already depends upon
  exceptions).

  Disadvantages
  -------------

  Whilst the bracket pattern is powerful, it does have some downsides of
  which you should be aware (specifically compared to [resourcet] which
  is the main alternative).

  First of all, independent of its usage with streaming, is that whilst
  `bracket` predates [resourcet], the latter is [more powerful].
  Whether this extra power is of use to you is up to you, but it does
  mean that you in effect have lots of nested resource management rather
  than just one overall resource control.

  [more powerful]: http://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2013/03/resourcet-overview

  The obvious disadvantage of using the bracket pattern is that it does
  not fit in as nicely in the function composition style that usage of
  streaming enables compared to other stream processing libraries.  This
  can be mitigated somewhat with using the lifted variants in this
  package which allows you to operate monadically (which still isn't as
  nice but may be preferable to lots of explicitly nested continuations).

  Furthermore, without prompt finalisation the same "long running
  computation" [issue] is relevant.  For example, consider something
  that looks like this:

  ```haskell
  withBinaryFile "myFile" ReadMode $
    doSomethingWithEachLine
    . B.lines
    . B.hGetContents
  ```

  Ideally, after the last chunk from the file is read, the file handle
  would be closed.  However, that is not the case: it's not until the
  _entire computation_ is complete that the handle is closed.  Note,
  however, that the same limitation is present when using
  `MonadResource`: this is a limitation of the `Stream` type, not on how
  we choose to allocate and manage resources.
