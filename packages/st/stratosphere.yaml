  # Change Log

  ## 0.37.0

  * Update resource specification document to version 3.0.0

  ## 0.36.0

  * Update resource specification document to version 2.29.0

  ## 0.35.0

  * Use a GADT for `Val a` so it is properly typed. This shouldn't break any
    programs that produced valid CloudFormation templates, but it should increase
    safety for templates that use intrinsic functions. This also allows us to
    properly implement some more intrinsic functions, like `Not`. See
    https://github.com/freckle/stratosphere/pull/120
  * Added the `Fn::Not` intrinsic function. Fixes
    https://github.com/freckle/stratosphere/issues/80

  ## 0.34.0

  * Don't encode `Bool`, `Int`, and `Double` values as strings in JSON. See:
    - https://github.com/frontrowed/stratosphere/pull/123 and
    - https://github.com/frontrowed/stratosphere/issues/86
  * Use `-O0` when compiling `stratosphere`
  * Update resource specification document to version 2.28.0

  ## 0.33.0

  * **BREAKING CHANGE**: We nuked the huge `ResourceProperties` sum type, which
    greatly reduced compile times, memory usage, and binary sizes for programs
    that depend on `stratosphere`. See:
    - https://github.com/frontrowed/stratosphere/issues/95
    - https://github.com/frontrowed/stratosphere/pull/121

    To migrate to this version, you should just have to remove any uses of the
    old `ResourceProperties` sum type and pass your resource configuration
    directly into `Resource`:

    ```diff
    @@ -32,7 +32,6 @@ dbTemplate =
     rdsMaster :: Resource
     rdsMaster =
       resource "RDSMaster" $
    -  RDSDBInstanceProperties $
       rdsdbInstance
       "db.t2.micro"
    ```

  ## 0.32.0

  * **BREAKING CHANGE**: We removed all `FromJSON` instances to reduce compile
    time and memory, and also to allow us to make other improvements that
    `FromJSON` was blocking. See
    https://github.com/frontrowed/stratosphere/issues/117

  ## 0.10.0

  * Update resource specification document to version 1.7.0

  ## 0.9.0

  * Update resource specification document to version 1.6.0

  ## 0.8.0

  * Update resource specification document (no version given in doc)
  * GHC 8.2.1 compatibility

  ## 0.7.1

  * Add `Export` field to the `Output` type. This allows you to declare
    cross-stack references.

  ## 0.7.0

  * Made `Val` and `ValList` more type-safe by moving some constructors to
    `ValList` and being more specific with types in functions that only accept
    `Text` parameters. Specific examples include:
    - `Join` and `Select` now require a `ValList` argument
    - `Base64` and `Join` now work only on `Val Text`, not `Val a`
    - `GetAZs` and `Split` are now in `ValList`, not `Val`
  * Created `ImportValueList` as a `ValList` alternative to `ImportValue`.
  * Added support for `Fn::Sub` intrinsic function.

  ## 0.6.0

  * **BREAKING CHANGE**: Added `ValList` type. This new type allows you to
    reference parameters that are already list types. Previously you had to use
    some kludgy workarounds. For example, you can now `Ref` a parameter of type
    `List<AWS::EC2::AvailabilityZone::Name>`.

    Every type that used to be `[Val a]` is now `ValList a`. If you use the
    `OverloadedLists` pragma, you might not have to change any of your code.
    Otherwise, you must wrap existing lists in the `ValList` constructor.

  * **BREAKING CHANGE**: The newtype wrappers `Integer'`, `Bool'`, and `Double'`
    are no longer required. CloudFormation expects numbers and bools to be JSON
    strings. These newtypes used to be necessary so we didn't use JSON
    numbers/bools. Now the conversion is handled internally, and users don't need
    to worry about this when using `stratosphere`.

  ## 0.5.0

  * Update resource specification document (no version given)

  ## 0.4.4

  * Update the resource specification document to version `1.4.2`

  ## 0.4.3

  * Update the resource specification document to version `1.4.1`

  ## 0.4.2

  * Update the resource specification document to version `1.2.1`

  ## 0.4.1

  * Manually write out all JSON instances to speed up compilation
  * Fix bug in CloudFormation specification where `EvaluationPeriods` was
    accidentally set to `Double`.

  ## 0.4.0

  * Derive the `Eq` type class for everything. This is useful when comparing two
    templates.
  * Added the new `Fn::Split` function.
  * Fix error in resource specification document where
    `AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup.Tags` was mistakenly called `AsTags`.
  * Fix error in resource specification document where the two properties `Image`
    and `Name` in `AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition.ContainerDefinition` were incorrectly
    marked as *not* required, even though they are required.
  * Fix JSON instances for auto scaling group update policies

  ## 0.3.1

  * Updated resource specification document to version 1.1.1.

  ## 0.3.0

  * **Backwards-incompatible**: We now use the official AWS JSON spec document to
    auto-generate types. This means there is no more Python scraper and custom
    JSON schemas. The behavior of the library is exactly the same, but a ton of
    resource names changed to match official the official AWS names. On the plus
    side, we now have 100% service coverage!

  ## 0.2.2

  * Fixed a test suite failure caused by bleeding edge HLint version.

  ## 0.2.1

  * Added Dynamo DB table resources (@ababkin)
  * Fix the Python docs scraper mishandling the `required` value in some cases,
    and also missing some properties of resources (@amar47shah)
  * Added a ton of SNS and SQS resources (@ababkin)
  * Added a experimental checker for duplicate resource names (@amar47shah)

  ## 0.2.0

  * Breaking change: The `DependsOn` property previously allowed lists of `Val
    Text`, when in fact CloudFormation only accepts literal `Text` values. The
    new type of `DependsOn` is `Maybe [Text]`.
  * Added `AWS::ElastiCache::CacheCluster` resource (@MichaelXavier)
  * Added many `AWS::Lambda` resources and associated resource properties (@ababkin)
  * Added new `ImportValue` CloudFormation function (@timmytofu)
  * Added tons of AWS Kineses resources (@MichaelXavier)
  * Added a lot of Api Gateway resources (@ababkin)
  * Allow setting `LensPrefix` in JSON model files to avoid name collisions
    (https://github.com/frontrowed/stratosphere/issues/27)

  ## 0.1.6

  * Fix Haddock parsing for `FindInMap`. We now run haddock in CircleCI so we
    shouldn't see a regression like this in the future.

  ## 0.1.5

  * Added S3 buckets and bucket policies
  * Added CloudTrail Trail (Thanks @timmytofu!)
  * Added the `FindInMap` intrinsic function. (Thanks @MichaelXavier!)
  * Added `SecurityGroupEgress` and `SecurityGroupIngress` rules. (Thanks
    @MichaelXavier!)
  * Fixed type of ELB policy using the more specific `NameAndValue` type. (Thanks
    @MichaelXavier!)

  ## 0.1.4

  * Added `UserName` property to the IAM User resource. (Thanks @timmytofu!)
  * Added IAM Group and Role name parameters. (Thanks again @timmytofu!)

  ## 0.1.3

  * Update `aeson-pretty` to version 0.8 so we can stay in stackage nightly.
  * Fix not exporting resource name lens.

  ## 0.1.2.1

  * Removed some dependencies that crept in so we can build against stackage
    nightly and use GHC 8. These were actually dependencies of
    `stratosphere-gen` and aren't needed for `stratosphere`.

  ## 0.1.2

  * Added all of the resources and resource properties for Auto Scaling Groups.
  * New AutoScalingGroup example
  * Added UpdatePolicy, CreationPolicy, and DependsOn

  ## 0.1.1

  * Small bug fix for "style" test when using the cabal distribution

  ## 0.1 (initial release)

  * Initial release with all Template components implemented along with a huge
    set of Resources.

  # Stratosphere: AWS CloudFormation in Haskell

  [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/freckle/stratosphere.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/freckle/stratosphere)

  AWS CloudFormation is a system that provisions and updates Amazon Web Services
  (AWS) resources based on declarative templates. Common criticisms of
  CloudFormation include the use of JSON as the template language and limited
  error-checking, often only available in the form of run-time errors and stack
  rollbacks. By wrapping templates in Haskell, we are able to easily construct
  them and help ensure correctness.

  The goals of stratosphere are to:
  * Build a Haskell EDSL to specify CloudFormation templates. Since it is
    embedded in Haskell, it is type-checked and generally much easier to work
    with than raw JSON.
  * Have a simple checking/linting system outside of the types that can find
    common errors in templates.
  * Be able to also read valid CloudFormation JSON templates so they can be
    type-checked. This also gives us free integration tests by using the huge
    amount of example templates available in the AWS docs.

  ## Example

  Here is an example of a `Template` that creates an EC2 instance, along with the
  JSON output:

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedLists #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

  module Main where

  import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 as B
  import Stratosphere

  main :: IO ()
  main = B.putStrLn $ encodeTemplate instanceTemplate

  instanceTemplate :: Template
  instanceTemplate =
    template
    [ resource "EC2Instance" (
      EC2InstanceProperties $
      ec2Instance
      "ami-22111148"
      & eciKeyName ?~ (Ref "KeyName")
      )
      & deletionPolicy ?~ Retain
    ]
    & description ?~ "Sample template"
    & parameters ?~
    [ parameter "KeyName" "AWS::EC2::KeyPair::KeyName"
      & description ?~ "Name of an existing EC2 KeyPair to enable SSH access to the instance"
      & constraintDescription ?~ "Must be the name of an existing EC2 KeyPair."
    ]
  ```

  ```json
  {
    "Description": "Sample template",
    "Parameters": {
      "KeyName": {
        "Description": "Name of an existing EC2 KeyPair to enable SSH access to the instance",
        "ConstraintDescription": "Must be the name of an existing EC2 KeyPair.",
        "Type": "AWS::EC2::KeyPair::KeyName"
      }
    },
    "Resources": {
      "EC2Instance": {
        "DeletionPolicy": "Retain",
        "Type": "AWS::EC2::Instance",
        "Properties": {
          "KeyName": {
            "Ref": "KeyName"
          },
          "ImageId": "ami-22111148"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Please see the [examples](examples/) directory for more in-depth examples.

  ## Value Types

  CloudFormation resource parameters can be literals (strings, integers, etc),
  references to another resource or a Parameter, or the result of some function
  call. We encapsulate all of these possibilities in the `Val a` type.

  We recommend using the `OverloadedStrings` extension to reduce the number of
  `Literal`s you have to use.

  ## Lenses

  Almost every CloudFormation resource has a handful of required arguments, and
  many more optional arguments. Each resource is represented as a record type
  with optional arguments wrapped in `Maybe`. Each resource also comes with a
  constructor that accepts required resource parameters as arguments. This allows
  the user to succinctly specify the resource parameters they actually use
  without adding too much noise to their code.

  To specify optional arguments, we recommend using the lens operators `&` and
  `?~`. In the example above, the `ec2Instance` function takes the AMI as an
  argument, since it is required by the `EC2Instance` resource type. Then, the
  optional EC2 key name is specified using the `&` and `?~` lens operators.

  This approach is very similar to the approach taken by the `amazonka` library.
  See this
  [blog post](http://brendanhay.nz/amazonka-comprehensive-haskell-aws-client#smart-constructors)
  for an explanation.

  ## Auto-generation

  All of the resources and resource properties are auto-generated from
  a
  [JSON schema file](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-resource-specification.html) and
  are placed in `library-gen/`. The `gen/` directory contains the auto-generator
  code and the JSON model file. We include the `library-gen/` directory in git so
  the build process is simplified. To build `library-gen` from scratch and then
  build all of `stratosphere`, just run the very short `build.sh` script. You can
  pass stack args to the script too, so run `./build.sh --fast` to build the
  library without optimization. This is useful for development.

  In the future, it would be great to not have to include the auto-generated code
  in git.

  ## Contributing

  Feel free to raise any issues, or even just make suggestions, by filing a
  Github issue.

  ## Future Work

  * Implement basic checker for things like undefined Refs and duplicate field
    names. This stuff would be too unwieldy to do in types, and performing a
    checking pass over a template should be pretty straightforward.
  * Use a custom JSON encoder so the templates look a little more idiomatic. We
    also create a lot of empty whitespace and newlines using aeson-pretty. There
    are limits on the size of CloudFormation templates, and we want readable
    output without hitting the limits. Also, we have some newtypes that just
    exist to override aeson instances, and we could get rid of those.
