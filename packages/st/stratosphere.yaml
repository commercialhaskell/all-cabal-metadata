  # Change Log

  ## 1.0 2025-11-07

  TLDR: Loads of breaking changes, with good reasons.

  Overall this release is meant to serve the future, not the past. So this release has many
  "bunched up" breaking changes which should reduce the need for breakng changes in the
  future, and improve maintainability and thus release frequency dramatically.

  * Drop generated field prefixes, making usage of the library way more natural. Especially its
    now possible to use this library just from the AWS provided cloudformation documentation
    without having to lookup the field prefixes in a second tab.

  * Drop support for GHC < 9.2. This simplifies the generator significantly. If you need older
    GHCs use the old versions of stratosphere. Dependency of dropping field prefixes. This library
    relies now on `NoFieldSelectors` internally.

  * Fully re-written generator, which works directly on the raw, un-preprocessed AWS
    specification, this should increase maintainabiltiy and release frequency.

  * Re-aligned generated module / builder function structure, removing all manual
    overwrites for dismabiguation.

  * Drop of the lens dependency, replaced with the `set @"PropertyName" value` idiom.

  * Split to one package per AWS service. This induces a small overhead on the user to
    select the packages the user needs, but reduces compilation time significantly.
    Also this works around limitations on OSX linker issues on many modules.
    Fixes: [#111](https://github.com/mbj/stratosphere/issues/184) [#102](https://github.com/mbj/stratosphere/issues/102)

  * Change `Val` to `Value`, its recommended to include stratosphere qualified where it clashes with
    `aeson` imports.

  * Remove support for custom enum types stratosphere used to tag
    on to the raw spec. Fixes: [#195](https://github.com/mbj/stratosphere/pull/195)

  * Update resource specification document to version 112.0.0 and re-generate all services.
    Fixes: [#140](https://github.com/mbj/stratosphere/issues/140)

  ## 0.60.0

  * Add and require aeson-2 support
  * Maintainer change to [Markus Schirp](https://github.com/mbj)
  * Drop support for pre GHC 9.0, user older releases if you are on
    these GHCs. This reduces maintainer overhead.
  * Add github actions based CI

  ## 0.42.0

  * Update resource specification document to version 6.0.0

  ## 0.41.0

  ## 0.37.0

  * Update resource specification document to version 3.0.0

  ## 0.36.0

  * Update resource specification document to version 2.29.0

  ## 0.35.0

  * Use a GADT for `Val a` so it is properly typed. This shouldn't break any
    programs that produced valid CloudFormation templates, but it should increase
    safety for templates that use intrinsic functions. This also allows us to
    properly implement some more intrinsic functions, like `Not`. See
    https://github.com/freckle/stratosphere/pull/120
  * Added the `Fn::Not` intrinsic function. Fixes
    https://github.com/freckle/stratosphere/issues/80

  ## 0.34.0

  * Don't encode `Bool`, `Int`, and `Double` values as strings in JSON. See:
    - https://github.com/frontrowed/stratosphere/pull/123 and
    - https://github.com/frontrowed/stratosphere/issues/86
  * Use `-O0` when compiling `stratosphere`
  * Update resource specification document to version 2.28.0

  ## 0.33.0

  * **BREAKING CHANGE**: We nuked the huge `ResourceProperties` sum type, which
    greatly reduced compile times, memory usage, and binary sizes for programs
    that depend on `stratosphere`. See:
    - https://github.com/frontrowed/stratosphere/issues/95
    - https://github.com/frontrowed/stratosphere/pull/121

    To migrate to this version, you should just have to remove any uses of the
    old `ResourceProperties` sum type and pass your resource configuration
    directly into `Resource`:

    ```diff
    @@ -32,7 +32,6 @@ dbTemplate =
     rdsMaster :: Resource
     rdsMaster =
       resource "RDSMaster" $
    -  RDSDBInstanceProperties $
       rdsdbInstance
       "db.t2.micro"
    ```

  ## 0.32.0

  * **BREAKING CHANGE**: We removed all `FromJSON` instances to reduce compile
    time and memory, and also to allow us to make other improvements that
    `FromJSON` was blocking. See
    https://github.com/frontrowed/stratosphere/issues/117

  ## 0.9.0

  * Update resource specification document to version 1.6.0

  ## 0.8.0

  * Update resource specification document (no version given in doc)
  * GHC 8.2.1 compatibility

  ## 0.7.1

  * Add `Export` field to the `Output` type. This allows you to declare
    cross-stack references.

  ## 0.7.0

  * Made `Val` and `ValList` more type-safe by moving some constructors to
    `ValList` and being more specific with types in functions that only accept
    `Text` parameters. Specific examples include:
    - `Join` and `Select` now require a `ValList` argument
    - `Base64` and `Join` now work only on `Val Text`, not `Val a`
    - `GetAZs` and `Split` are now in `ValList`, not `Val`
  * Created `ImportValueList` as a `ValList` alternative to `ImportValue`.
  * Added support for `Fn::Sub` intrinsic function.

  ## 0.6.0

  * **BREAKING CHANGE**: Added `ValList` type. This new type allows you to
    reference parameters that are already list types. Previously you had to use
    some kludgy workarounds. For example, you can now `Ref` a parameter of type
    `List<AWS::EC2::AvailabilityZone::Name>`.

    Every type that used to be `[Val a]` is now `ValList a`. If you use the
    `OverloadedLists` pragma, you might not have to change any of your code.
    Otherwise, you must wrap existing lists in the `ValList` constructor.

  * **BREAKING CHANGE**: The newtype wrappers `Integer'`, `Bool'`, and `Double'`
    are no longer required. CloudFormation expects numbers and bools to be JSON
    strings. These newtypes used to be necessary so we didn't use JSON
    numbers/bools. Now the conversion is handled internally, and users don't need
    to worry about this when using `stratosphere`.

  ## 0.5.0

  * Update resource specification document (no version given)

  ## 0.4.4

  * Update the resource specification document to version `1.4.2`

  ## 0.4.3

  * Update the resource specification document to version `1.4.1`

  ## 0.4.2

  * Update the resource specification document to version `1.2.1`

  ## 0.4.1

  * Manually write out all JSON instances to speed up compilation
  * Fix bug in CloudFormation specification where `EvaluationPeriods` was
    accidentally set to `Double`.

  ## 0.4.0

  * Derive the `Eq` type class for everything. This is useful when comparing two
    templates.
  * Added the new `Fn::Split` function.
  * Fix error in resource specification document where
    `AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup.Tags` was mistakenly called `AsTags`.
  * Fix error in resource specification document where the two properties `Image`
    and `Name` in `AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition.ContainerDefinition` were incorrectly
    marked as *not* required, even though they are required.
  * Fix JSON instances for auto scaling group update policies

  ## 0.3.1

  * Updated resource specification document to version 1.1.1.

  ## 0.3.0

  * **Backwards-incompatible**: We now use the official AWS JSON spec document to
    auto-generate types. This means there is no more Python scraper and custom
    JSON schemas. The behavior of the library is exactly the same, but a ton of
    resource names changed to match official the official AWS names. On the plus
    side, we now have 100% service coverage!

  ## 0.2.2

  * Fixed a test suite failure caused by bleeding edge HLint version.

  ## 0.2.1

  * Added Dynamo DB table resources (@ababkin)
  * Fix the Python docs scraper mishandling the `required` value in some cases,
    and also missing some properties of resources (@amar47shah)
  * Added a ton of SNS and SQS resources (@ababkin)
  * Added a experimental checker for duplicate resource names (@amar47shah)

  ## 0.2.0

  * Breaking change: The `DependsOn` property previously allowed lists of `Val
    Text`, when in fact CloudFormation only accepts literal `Text` values. The
    new type of `DependsOn` is `Maybe [Text]`.
  * Added `AWS::ElastiCache::CacheCluster` resource (@MichaelXavier)
  * Added many `AWS::Lambda` resources and associated resource properties (@ababkin)
  * Added new `ImportValue` CloudFormation function (@timmytofu)
  * Added tons of AWS Kineses resources (@MichaelXavier)
  * Added a lot of Api Gateway resources (@ababkin)
  * Allow setting `LensPrefix` in JSON model files to avoid name collisions
    (https://github.com/frontrowed/stratosphere/issues/27)

  ## 0.1.6

  * Fix Haddock parsing for `FindInMap`. We now run haddock in CircleCI so we
    shouldn't see a regression like this in the future.

  ## 0.1.5

  * Added S3 buckets and bucket policies
  * Added CloudTrail Trail (Thanks @timmytofu!)
  * Added the `FindInMap` intrinsic function. (Thanks @MichaelXavier!)
  * Added `SecurityGroupEgress` and `SecurityGroupIngress` rules. (Thanks
    @MichaelXavier!)
  * Fixed type of ELB policy using the more specific `NameAndValue` type. (Thanks
    @MichaelXavier!)

  ## 0.1.4

  * Added `UserName` property to the IAM User resource. (Thanks @timmytofu!)
  * Added IAM Group and Role name parameters. (Thanks again @timmytofu!)

  ## 0.1.3

  * Update `aeson-pretty` to version 0.8 so we can stay in stackage nightly.
  * Fix not exporting resource name lens.

  ## 0.1.2.1

  * Removed some dependencies that crept in so we can build against stackage
    nightly and use GHC 8. These were actually dependencies of
    `stratosphere-gen` and aren't needed for `stratosphere`.

  ## 0.1.2

  * Added all of the resources and resource properties for Auto Scaling Groups.
  * New AutoScalingGroup example
  * Added UpdatePolicy, CreationPolicy, and DependsOn

  ## 0.1.1

  * Small bug fix for "style" test when using the cabal distribution

  ## 0.1 (initial release)

  * Initial release with all Template components implemented along with a huge
    set of Resources.

  # Stratosphere: AWS CloudFormation in Haskell

  [![CI](https://github.com/mbj/stratosphere/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mbj/stratosphere/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)
  [![sponsors](https://img.shields.io/github/sponsors/mbj)](https://github.com/sponsors/mbj)
  [![hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/stratosphere)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stratosphere)

  AWS CloudFormation is a system that provisions and updates Amazon Web Services
  (AWS) resources based on declarative templates. Common criticisms of
  CloudFormation include the use of JSON as the template language and limited
  error-checking, often only available in the form of run-time errors and stack
  rollbacks. By wrapping templates in Haskell, it is possible to easily construct
  them and help ensure correctness.

  The goals of stratosphere are to:

  * Build a Haskell EDSL to specify CloudFormation templates. Since it is
    embedded in Haskell, it is type-checked and generally much easier to work
    with than raw JSON/YAML.
  * Have a simple checking/linting system outside of the types that can find
    common errors in templates.

  ## Funding / Sponsoring

  This library is maintained by [mbj](https://github.com/sponsors/mbj) and any pledge is greatly apprechiated.

  ## Example

  **THIS SHOWS UNRELEASED API, to use it use a git source while 1.0 is under development** [old readme](https://github.com/mbj/stratosphere/tree/v0.60.0#readme).

  Here is an example of a `Template` that creates an EC2 instance, along with the
  JSON output:

  ```haskell
  module Main where

  import Stratosphere

  import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 as B

  main :: IO ()
  main = B.putStrLn $ encodeTemplate template

  template :: Template
  template
    = mkTemplate [ec2Instance]
    & set @"Description" "EC2 Example template"
    & set @"Parameters"  [keyName]

  keyName :: Parameter
  keyName
    = mkParameter "KeyName" "AWS::EC2::KeyPair::KeyName"
    & set @"Description"           "Name of an existing EC2 KeyPair to enable SSH access to the instance"
    & set @"ConstraintDescription" "Must be the name of an existing EC2 KeyPair."

  ec2Instance :: Resource
  ec2Instance
    = set @"DeletionPolicy" Retain
    . resource "EC2Instance"
    $ EC2.mkInstance
    & set @"ImageId" "ami-22111148"
    & set @"KeyName" (toRef keyName)
  ```

  ```json
  {
    "Description": "EC2 Example template",
    "Parameters": {
      "KeyName": {
        "Description": "Name of an existing EC2 KeyPair to enable SSH access to the instance",
        "ConstraintDescription": "Must be the name of an existing EC2 KeyPair.",
        "Type": "AWS::EC2::KeyPair::KeyName"
      }
    },
    "Resources": {
      "EC2Instance": {
        "DeletionPolicy": "Retain",
        "Properties": {
          "ImageId": "ami-22111148",
          "KeyName": {
            "Ref": "KeyName"
          }
        },
        "Type": "AWS::EC2::Instance"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Please see the [examples](examples/Stratosphere/Examples) directory for more in-depth
  examples (including this one). The `stratosphere-example` package produces a same named
  binary with a minimal CLI for exploration.

  Its encouraged to use it as a playground while exploring this library.

  ```
  STACK_YAML=stack-9.2.yaml stack build --copy-bins --test stratosphere-examples
  ```

  ## Value Types

  CloudFormation resource parameters can be literals (strings, integers, etc),
  references to another resource or a Parameter, or the result of some function
  call. We encapsulate all of these possibilities in the `Value a` type.

  It is recommend using the `OverloadedStrings` and `OverloadedLists` extensions to reduce
  the number of `Literal`s that have to be written.

  ## Optional and required properties

  Almost every CloudFormation resource has a handful of required arguments, and
  many more optional arguments. Each resource is represented as a record type
  with optional arguments wrapped in `Maybe`. Each resource also comes with a
  builder that accepts required resource properties as arguments. This allows
  the user to succinctly specify the resource properties they actually use
  without adding too much noise to their code.

  To specify optional arguments, stratosphere exposes the `set` function that takes
  the type level symbol of the property to set and the value as argument. Its recommended to use the
  `&` function to chain these updates. See examples.

  ## Auto-generation

  All of the resources and resource properties are auto-generated from
  a
  [JSON schema file](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-resource-specification.html) and
  are placed in `services/`. The `generator/` directory contains the auto-generator package `stratosphere-generator`
  code and the JSON model file. The `services/` directory is included in git so
  the build process is simplified. To build `stratosphere-generator` from scratch and
  then build all of `stratosphere`, build the `stratosphere-generator` package via `stack` and execute the `stratosphere-generator` binary from the project root.

  ## Contributing

  Feel free to raise any issues, or even just make suggestions, by filing a Github issue.

  ## Future Work

  * Implement basic checker for things like undefined Refs and duplicate field
    names. This stuff would be too unwieldy to do in types, and performing a
    checking pass over a template should be pretty straightforward.

  ## Development Build

  ```
  # Warning this takes a while ;)

  # Compile all packages
  STACK_YAML=stack-9.12.yaml stack test

  # Run the generator
  STACK_YAML=stack-9.12.yaml stack build stratosphere-manager
  STACK_YAML=stack-9.12.yaml stack exec stratosphere-manager -- generate
  ```
