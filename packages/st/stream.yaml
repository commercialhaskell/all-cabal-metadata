  ## stream

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/stream.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/stream)

  *NOTE* This library is very much in prerelease state. If you see this released
  anywhere, it's just available for easier sharing with others. Please do _not_
  start using it yet.

  Streaming data library built around making stream fusion a first-class concept.
  Focus is on high performance and usability.

  Unlike more commonly used streaming libraries (like conduit, enumerator, or
  pipes), this library is _not_ coroutine based.
