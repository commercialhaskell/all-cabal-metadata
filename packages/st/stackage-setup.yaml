  ============

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/stackage-setup.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/stackage-setup)

  An executable for easily setting up a Haskell work environment. This project is similar in spirit to minGHC. It is currently Linux (64 bit) only, but with hopes of making it cross platform eventually.

  Currently includes: ghc, cabal, happy, alex, and various
  stackage-cli plugins.

  ```
  $ stackage-setup ghc-7.8
  ```

  ```
  $ stackage-setup ghc-7.10
