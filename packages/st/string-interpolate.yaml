  # CHANGELOG

  ## Unreleased

  ## v0.3.1.1 (2021-05-21)

  + Updated dependency versions for HSpec and template-haskell

  ## v0.3.1.0 (2021-02-12)

  + Added variant interpolators, `__i'E`, `__i'L`, `iii'E`, `iii'L`, that handle
    surrounding newlines in a different way based on suffix.

  ## v0.3.0.2 (2020-10-01)

  + Removed upper bounds on `base16-bytestring`. Safe to do so now that
    `text-converions` has added upper bounds. This change should not affect any
    users of `string-interpolate`.

  ## v0.3.0.1 (2020-09-19)

  + Downgraded version of `base16-bytestring` to avoid breaking API changes in new
    versions. (We would just upgrade the version ourselves, but it's one of our
    dependencies `text-conversions` that's not building due to the API changes,
    not us.)

  ## v0.3.0.0 (2020-06-30)

  + Changed the behavior of `iii` to only collapse statically-available whitespace,
    which also removes the performance penalty of using `iii`.
  + Removed noise on compile errors if quasiquoters are misused
  + Changed behavior of backslash escapes to error on unknown escape characters

  ## v0.2.1.0 (2020-05-04)

  + Added `__i` interpolator for stripping indentation in multiline strings
  + Added benchmarks for lazy Text and lazy ByteString
  + Changed default behavior for Text and ByteString to use the actual types
    themselves as intermediate objects rather than construct Builders. This
    should give significant speedups in the common case of interpolating
    smaller outputs. Old behavior can be reenabled using Cabal
    flags `-ftext-builder` and `-fbytestring-builder`
  + Gated benchmarks for `Interpolation` and `interpolatedstring-perl6` behind
    a Cabal flag so that we can still be in Stackage without needing to remove
    these dependencies

  ## v0.2.0.3 (2020-04-26)

  + Commented out `interpolatedstring-perl6` benchmarks, since that library
    does not build on GHC 8.8.2

  ## v0.2.0.2 (2020-04-25)

  + Updated interpolation parser to use enabled language extensions
    (Thanks Cary Robbins!)

  ## v0.2.0.1 (2020-04-09)

  + Fixed bug caused when escaping a backslash right before an interpolation
    (Thanks Vladimir Stepchenko!)
  + Fixed behavior of `iii` (Thanks Vladimir Stepchenko!)

  ## v0.2.0.0 (2019-12-16)

  + Added `iii` interpolator for collapsing whitespace/newlines into
    single spaces
  + Added feature comparison to/benchmark with `neat-interpolation`
  + Just generally make the documentation better
  + Add homepage info to cabal file/Haddock documentation

  ## v0.1.0.1 (2019-05-06)

  + Remove Interpolation from the default benchmarks because it's not
    on Stackage

  ## v0.1.0.0 (2019-03-17)

  + Add support for using Text and ByteString `Builder`s as both sinks
    and sources
  + Add support for interpolating Chars without the surrounding quotes

  ## v0.0.1.0 (2019-03-10)

  # string-interpolate [![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/williamyaoh/string-interpolate/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/williamyaoh/string-interpolate/commits/master) [![hackage version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/string-interpolate.svg)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/string-interpolate) [![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSD--3-ff69b4.svg)](https://gitlab.com/williamyaoh/string-interpolate/blob/master/LICENSE)

  Haskell having 5 different textual types in common use (String, strict and lazy
  Text, strict and lazy ByteString) means that doing any kind of string
  manipulation becomes a complicated game of type tetris with constant conversion
  back and forth. What if string handling was as simple and easy as it is in
  literally any other language?

  Behold:

  ```haskell
  showWelcomeMessage :: Text -> Integer -> Text
  showWelcomeMessage username visits =
    [i|Welcome to my website, #{username}! You are visitor #{visits}!|]
  ```

  No more needing to `mconcat`, `mappend`, and `(<>)` to glue strings together.
  No more having to remember a gajillion different functions for converting
  between strict and lazy versions of Text, or having to worry about encoding
  between Text <=> ByteString. No more getting bitten by trying to work with
  Unicode ByteStrings. It just works!

  **string-interpolate** provides a quasiquoter, `i`, that allows you to interpolate
  expressions directly into your string. It can produce anything that is an
  instance of `IsString`, and can interpolate anything which is an instance of
  `Show`.

  In addition to the main quasiquoter `i`, there are two additional quasiquoters
  for handling multiline strings. If you need to remove extra whitespace and
  collapse into a single line, use `iii`. If you need to remove extra indentation
  but keep linebreaks, use `__i`.

  If you need even *more* specific functionality in how you handle whitespace,
  there are variants of `__i` and `iii` with different behavior for
  surrounding newlines. These are suffixed by either `'E` or `'L` depending
  on what behavior you need. For instance, `__i'E` will remove extra indentation
  from its body, but will leave any surrounding newlines intact. `iii'L` will
  collapse its body into a single line, and collapse any surrounding newlines
  at the beginning/end into a single newline.

  ## Unicode handling

  **string-interpolate** handles converting to/from Unicode when converting
  String/Text to ByteString and vice versa. Lots of libraries use ByteString to
  represent human-readable text, even though this is not safe. There are lots of
  useful libraries in the ecosystem that are unfortunately annoying to work with
  because of the need to generate ByteStrings containing application-specific info.
  Insisting on explicitly converting to/from UTF-8 in these cases and handling
  decoding failures adds lots of syntactic noise, when often you can reasonably
  assume that a given ByteString will, 95% of the time, contain Unicode text.
  So string-interpolate aims to provide reasonable defaults around conversion
  between ByteString and real textual types so that developers don't need to
  constantly be aware of text encodings.

  When converting a String/Text to a ByteString, **string-interpolate** will
  automatically encode it as a sequence of UTF-8 bytes. When converting a
  ByteString to String/Text, string-interpolate will assume that the ByteString
  contains a UTF-8 string, and convert the characters accordingly. Any invalid
  characters in the ByteString will be converted to the Unicode replacement
  character � (U+FFFD).

  Remember: **string-interpolate** is not designed for 100% correctness around text
  encodings, just for convenience in the most common case. If you absolutely need
  to be aware of text encodings and to handle decode failures, take a look at
  [text-conversions](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-conversions).

  ## Usage

  First things first: add **string-interpolate** to your dependencies:

  ```yaml
  dependencies:
    - string-interpolate
  ```

  and import the quasiquoter and enable `-XQuasiQuotes`:

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes #-}

  import Data.String.Interpolate ( i )
  ```

  Wrap anything you want to be interpolated with `#{}`:

  ```haskell
  λ> name = "William"
  λ> [i|Hello, #{name}!|] :: String
  >>> "Hello, William!"
  ```

  You can interpolate in anything which implements `Show`:

  ```haskell
  λ> import Data.Time
  λ> now <- getCurrentTime
  λ> [i|The current time is #{now}.|] :: String
  >>> "The current time is 2019-03-10 18:58:40.573892546 UTC."
  ```

  ...and interpolate into anything which implements `IsString`.

  string-interpolate *must* know what concrete type it's producing; it cannot be
  used to generate a `IsString a => a`. If you're using string-interpolate from
  GHCi, make sure to add type signatures to toplevel usages!

  string-interpolate also needs to know what concrete type it's *interpolating*.
  For instance, the following code won't work:

  ```haskell
  showIt :: Show a => a -> String
  showIt it = [i|The value: #{it}|]
  ```

  You would need to convert `it` to a String using `show` first.

  Strings and characters are always interpolated without surrounding quotes.

  ```haskell
  λ> verb = 'c'
  λ> noun = "sea"
  λ> [i|We went to go #{verb} the #{noun}.|] :: String
  >>> "We went to go c the sea."
  ```

  You can interpolate arbitrary expressions:

  ```haskell
  λ> [i|Tomorrow's date is #{addDays 1 $ utctDay now}.|] :: String
  >>> "Tomorrow's date is 2019-03-11."
  ```

  **string-interpolate**, by default, handles multiline strings by copying the
  newline verbatim into the output.

  ```haskell
  λ> :{
   | [i|
   |   a
   |   b
   |   c
   | |] :: String
   | :}
  >>> "\n  a\n  b\n  c\n"
  ```

  Another quasiquoter, `iii`, is provided that handles multiline strings/whitespace
  in a different way, by collapsing any whitespace into a single space. The
  intention is to use it when you want to split something across multiple
  lines in source for readability but want it emitted like a normal sentence.
  `iii` is otherwise identical to `i`, with the ability to interpolate arbitrary values.

  ```haskell
  λ> :{
   | [iii|
   |   Lorum
   |   ipsum
   |   dolor
   |   sit
   |   amet.
   | |] :: String
   | :}
  >>> "Lorum ipsum dolor sit amet."
  ```

  One last quasiquoter, `__i`, is provided that handles removing indentation
  without removing line breaks, perhaps if you need to output code samples
  or error messages. Again, `__i` is otherwise identical to `i`, with the ability
  to interpolate arbitrary values.

  ```haskell
  λ> :{
   | [__i|
   |   id :: a -> a
   |   id x = y
   |     where y = x
   | |] :: String
   | :}
  >>> "id :: a -> a\nid x = y\n  where y = x"
  ```

  The intended mnemonics for remembering what `iii` and `__i` do:

  * `iii`: Look at the i's as individual lines which have been collapsed into a single line
  * `__i`: Look at the i as being indented

  In addition, there are variants of `iii` and `__i`, desginated by a letter
  suffix. For instance, `__i'L` will reduce indentation, while collapsing
  any surrounding newlines into a single newline.

  ```haskell
  λ> :{
   | [__i'L|
   |
   |   id :: a -> a
   |   id x = y
   |     where y = x
   |
   | |] :: String
   | :}
  >>> "\nid :: a -> a\nid x = y\n  where y = x\n"
  ```

  Currently there are two variant suffixes, `'E` and `'L`'

  * `'E`: Leave any surrounding newlines intact. To remember what this does, look
    visually at the capital E; the multiple horizontal lines suggests multiple
    newlines.
  * `'L`: Collapse any surrounding newlines into a single newline. To remember what
    this does, look visually at the capital L; the single horizontal line suggests
    a single newline.

  Check the Haddock documentation for all the available variants.

  Backslashes are handled exactly the same way they are in normal Haskell strings.
  If you need to put a literal `#{` into your string, prefix the pound symbol with
  a backslash:

  ```haskell
  λ> [i|\#{ some inner text }#|] :: String
  >>> "#{ some inner text }#"
  ```

  ## Comparison to other interpolation libraries

  Some other interpolation libraries available:

  * [**interpolate**](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/interpolate)
  * [**formatting**](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/formatting)
  * **Text.Printf**, from base
  * [**neat-interpolation**](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/neat-interpolation)
  * [**Interpolation**](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Interpolation)
  * [**interpolatedstring-perl6**](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/interpolatedstring-perl6-1.0.1)

  Of these, **Text.Printf** isn't exception-safe, and **neat-interpolation** can only
  produce strict Text values. **interpolate**, **formatting**, **Interpolation**, and
  **interpolatedstring-perl6** provide different solutions to the problem of
  providing a general way of interpolating any value, into any kind of text.

  ⚠ Since **formatting** doesn't support ByteStrings, it technically supports
    Unicode.

  ⚠ **Interpolation** supports all five textual formats, but doesn't allow you
    to mix and match; that is, you can't interpolate a String into an output
    string of type Text, and vice versa.

  ⚠ **neat-interpolation** only supports strict Text. Because of that, it technically
    supports Unicode.

  ### Performance

  Overall: **string-interpolate** is competitive with the fastest interpolation
  libraries, only getting outperformed on ByteStrings by **Interpolation** and
  **interpolatedstring-perl6**, and on large, strict Text specifically by **formatting**.

  We run three benchmarks: small string interpolation (<100 chars) with a single
  interpolation parameter; small strings with multiple interpolation parameters,
  and large string (~100KB) interpolation. Each of these benchmarks is then run
  against `String`, both `Text` types, and both `ByteString` types. Numbers are
  runtime in relation to string-interpolate; smaller is better.

  (We don't bother running tests on large `String`s, because no one is working
  with data that large using `String` anyways.)

  In particular, notice that **Interpolation** and **interpolatedstring-perl6**
  blow up on both Text types; **string-interpolate** and **formatting** have
  consistent performance across all benchmarks, with string-interpolation leading
  the pack in `Text` cases.

  All results were tested on an AWS EC2 `t2.medium`, with GHC 8.6.5. If you'd
  like to replicate the results, the benchmarks are located in `bench/`, and can
  be run with `cabal v2-run string-interpolate-bench -O2 -fextended-benchmarks`.

  #### Larger Text and ByteString

  By default, **string-interpolate** is performance tuned for outputting smaller
  strings. If you find yourself regularly needing extremely large outputs, however,
  you can change the way output strings are constructed to optimize accordingly.
  Enable either the `text-builder` or `bytestring-builder` Cabal flag, depending
  on your need, and you should see speedups constructing large strings, at the
  cost of slowing down smaller outputs.
