  # string-interpolate [![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/williamyaoh/string-interpolate/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/williamyaoh/string-interpolate/commits/master) [![hackage version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/string-interpolate.svg)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/string-interpolate) [![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSD--3-ff69b4.svg)](https://gitlab.com/williamyaoh/string-interpolate/blob/master/LICENSE)

  Haskell having 5 different textual types in common use (String, strict and lazy
  Text, strict and lazy ByteString) means that doing any kind of string
  manipulation becomes a complicated game of type tetris with constant conversion
  back and forth. What if string handling was as simple and easy as it is in
  literally any other language?

  Behold:

  ```haskell
  showWelcomeMessage :: Text -> Integer -> Text
  showWelcomeMessage username visits =
    [i|Welcome to my website, #{username}! You are visitor #{visits}!|]
  ```

  No more needing to `mconcat`, `mappend`, and `(<>)` to glue strings together.
  No more having to remember a gajillion different functions for converting
  between strict and lazy versions of Text, or having to worry about encoding
  between Text <=> ByteString. No more getting bitten by trying to work with
  Unicode ByteStrings. It just works!

  **string-interpolate** provides a quasiquoter, `i`, that allows you to interpolate
  expressions directly into your string. It can produce anything that is an
  instance of `IsString`, and can interpolate anything which is an instance of
  `Show`.

  ## Unicode handling

  **string-interpolate** handles converting to/from Unicode when converting
  String/Text to ByteString and vice versa. Lots of libraries use ByteString to
  represent human-readable text, even though this is not safe. There are lots of
  useful libraries in the ecosystem that are unfortunately annoying to work with
  because of the need to generate ByteStrings containing application-specific info.
  Insisting on explicitly converting to/from UTF-8 in these cases and handling
  decoding failures adds lots of syntactic noise, when often you can reasonably
  assume that a given ByteString will, 95% of the time, contain Unicode text.
  So string-interpolate aims to provide reasonable defaults around conversion
  between ByteString and real textual types so that developers don't need to
  constantly be aware of text encodings.

  When converting a String/Text to a ByteString, string-interpolate will
  automatically encode it as a sequence of UTF-8 bytes. When converting a
  ByteString to String/Text, string-interpolate will assume that the ByteString
  contains a UTF-8 string, and convert the characters accordingly. Any invalid
  characters in the ByteString will be converted to the Unicode replacement
  character � (U+FFFD).

  Remember: string-interpolate is not designed for 100% correctness around text
  encodings, just for convenience in the most common case. If you absolutely need
  to be aware of text encodings and to handle decode failures, take a look at
  [text-conversions](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-conversions).

  ## Usage

  First things first: add **string-interpolate** to your dependencies:

  ```yaml
  dependencies:
    - string-interpolate
  ```

  and import the quasiquoter and enable `-XQuasiQuotes`:

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes #-}

  import Data.String.Interpolate ( i )
  ```

  Wrap anything you want to be interpolated with `#{}`:

  ```haskell
  λ> name = "William"
  λ> [i|Hello, #{name}!|] :: String
  >>> "Hello, William!"
  ```

  You can interpolate in anything which implements `Show`:

  ```haskell
  λ> import Data.Time
  λ> now <- getCurrentTime
  λ> [i|The current time is #{now}.|] :: String
  >>> "The current time is 2019-03-10 18:58:40.573892546 UTC."
  ```

  ...and interpolate into anything which implements `IsString`.

  string-interpolate *must* know what concrete type it's producing; it cannot be
  used to generate a `IsString a => a`. If you're using string-interpolate from
  GHCi, make sure to add type signatures to toplevel usages!

  string-interpolate also needs to know what concrete type it's *interpolating*.
  For instance, the following code won't work:

  ```haskell
  showIt :: Show a => a -> String
  showIt it = [i|The value: #{it}|]
  ```

  You would need to convert `it` to a String using `show` first.

  Strings and characters are always interpolated without surrounding quotes.

  ```haskell
  λ> verb = 'c'
  λ> noun = "sea"
  λ> [i|We went to go #{verb} the #{noun}.|] :: String
  >>> "We went to go c the sea."
  ```

  You can interpolate arbitrary expressions:

  ```haskell
  λ> [i|Tomorrow's date is #{addDays 1 $ utctDay now}.|] :: String
  >>> "Tomorrow's date is 2019-03-11."
  ```

  **string-interpolate**, by default, handles multiline strings by copying the
  newline verbatim into the output.

  ```haskell
  λ> :{
   | [i|
   |   a
   |   b
   |   c
   | |] :: String
   | :}
  >>> "\n  a\n  b\n  c\n"
  ```

  A second quasiquoter, `iii`, is provided that handles multiline strings/whitespace
  in a different way, by collapsing any whitespace into a single space. The
  intention is to use it when you want to split something across multiple
  lines in source for readability but want it emitted like a normal sentence.
  `iii` is otherwise identical to `i`.

  ```haskell
  λ> :{
   | [iii|
   |   Lorum
   |   ipsum
   |   dolor
   |   sit
   |   amet.
   | |] :: String
   | :}
  >>> "Lorum ipsum dolor sit amet."
  ```

  A pnemonic for remembering what `iii` does is to look at the i's as individual
  lines which have been collapsed into a single line.

  Backslashes are handled exactly the same way they are in normal Haskell strings.
  If you need to put a literal `#{` into your string, prefix the pound symbol with
  a backslash:

  ```haskell
  λ> [i|\#{ some inner text }#|] :: String
  >>> "#{ some inner text }#"
  ```

  ## Comparison to other interpolation libraries

  Some other interpolation libraries available:

  * [interpolate](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/interpolate)
  * [formatting](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/formatting)
  * Text.Printf, from base
  * [neat-interpolation](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/neat-interpolation)
  * [Interpolation](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Interpolation)
  * [interpolatedstring-perl6](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/interpolatedstring-perl6-1.0.1)

  Of these, Text.Printf isn't exception-safe, and neat-interpolation can only
  produce Text values. interpolate, formatting, Interpolation, and
  interpolatedstring-perl6 provide different solutions to the problem of
  providing a general way of interpolating any value, into any kind of text.

  ⚠ Since `formatting` doesn't support ByteStrings, it technically supports
    Unicode.

  ⚠ `Interpolation` supports all five textual formats, but doesn't allow you
    to mix and match; that is, you can't interpolate a String into an output
    string of type Text, and vice versa.

  ⚠ `neat-interpolation` only supports `Text`. Because of that, it technically
    supports Unicode.

  ### Performance

  Overall: **string-interpolate** is competitive with the fastest interpolation
  libraries, only getting outperformed by **Interpolation** and
  **interpolatedstring-perl6**, and even then mostly on ByteStrings. Since
  these two libraries don't handle Unicode and **string-interpolate** converts
  things to UTF-8, some slowdown is to be expected here.

  We run three benchmarks: small string interpolation (<100 chars) with a single
  interpolation parameter; small strings with multiple interpolation parameters,
  and large string (~100KB) interpolation. Each of these benchmarks is then
  run against `String`, strict `Text`, and strict `ByteString`. Numbers are runtime
  in relation to string-interpolate; smaller is better.

  | small Text               | 1x                     | 28x             | 1.5x           | 2.2x              | 2.2x                         | 3.3x                   |

  | small ByteString         | 1x                     | 15x             | N/A            | 0.35x             | 0.35x                        | N/A                    |
  | multi interp, ByteString | 1x                     | 10x             | N/A            | 0.5x              | 0.5x                         | N/A                    |
  | large ByteString         | 1x                     | 100,000x        | N/A            | 1.6x              | 1.6x                         | N/A                    |

  (We don't bother running tests on large `String`s, because no one is working
  with data that large using `String` anyways.)

  In particular, notice that **Interpolation** and **interpolatedstring-perl6**
  blow up on large Text; **string-interpolation** and **formatting** have
  consistent performance across all benchmarks, with string-interpolation leading
  the pack in `Text` cases.

  All results were tested on my local machine. If you'd like to attempt to replicate
  the results, the benchmarks are in `bench/` and can be run with a simple
  `stack bench`.

  (NB: If you're attempting to reproduce these benchmarks, note that the
  benchmarks for **Interpolation** are commented out by default, due to
  that package not being in Stackage.)
