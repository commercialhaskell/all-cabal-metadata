  # streamly-text

  Library for streamly and text interoperation.

  This library is to enable interoperation of streamly with existing code that
  uses `Text`.

  The package provides APIs to interconvert between strict `Text` and streamly
  `Array Word8` and between lazy `Text` and stream of `Array Word8`.

  The interconversion in the case of strict `Text` and streamly `Array Word8` has
  no overhead.
