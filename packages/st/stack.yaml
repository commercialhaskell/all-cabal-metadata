changelog: ! "# Changelog\n\n## 1.3.2\n\nBug fixes:\n\n* `stack config set` can now
  be used without a compiler installed\n  [#2852](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2852).\n*
  `get-stack.sh` now installs correct binary on ARM for generic linux and raspbian,\n
  \ closing [#2856](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2856).\n* Correct
  the testing of whether a package database exists by checking\n  for the `package.cache`
  file itself instead of the containing\n  directory.\n* Revert a change in the previous
  release which made it impossible to\n  set local extra-dep packages as targets.
  This was overkill; we\n  really only wanted to disable their test suites, which
  was already\n  handled by a later\n  patch. [#2849](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2849)\n*
  `stack new` always treats templates as being UTF-8 encoding,\n  ignoring locale
  settings on a local machine. See\n  [Yesod mailing list discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/yesodweb/ZyWLsJOtY0c/aejf9E7rCAAJ)\n\n##
  1.3.0\n\nRelease notes:\n\n* For the _next_ stack release after this one, we are
  planning\n  changes to our Linux releases, including dropping our Ubuntu,\n  Debian,
  CentOS, and Fedora package repositories and switching to\n  statically linked binaries.
  See\n  [#2534](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2534).\n  Note
  that upgrading without a package manager has gotten easier\n  with new binary upgrade
  support in `stack upgrade` (see the Major\n  Changes section below for more information).
  In addition, the\n  get.haskellstack.org script no longer installs from Ubuntu,\n
  \ Debian, CentOS, or Fedora package repositories. Instead it places\n  a generic
  binary in /usr/local/bin.\n\nMajor changes:\n\n* Stack will now always use its own
  GHC installation, even when a suitable GHC\n  installation is available on the PATH.
  To get the old behaviour, use\n  the `--system-ghc` flag or run `stack config set
  system-ghc --global true`.\n  Docker- and Nix-enabled projects continue to use the
  GHC installations\n  in their environment by default.\n\n    NB: Scripts that previously
  used stack in combination with a system GHC\n    installation should now include
  a `stack setup` line or use the `--install-ghc`\n    flag.\n    [#2221](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2221)\n\n*
  `stack ghci` now defaults to skipping the build of target packages, because\n  support
  has been added for invoking \"initial build steps\", which create\n  autogen files
  and run preprocessors. The `--no-build` flag is now deprecated\n  because it should
  no longer be necessary. See\n  [#1364](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1364)\n\n*
  Stack is now capable of doing binary upgrades instead of always\n  recompiling a
  new version from source. Running `stack upgrade` will\n  now default to downloading
  a binary version of Stack from the most\n  recent release, if one is available.
  See `stack upgrade --help` for\n  more options.\n  [#1238](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1238)\n\nBehavior
  changes:\n\n* Passing `--resolver X` with a Stack command which forces creation
  of a global\n  project config, will pass resolver X into the initial config.\n  See
  [#2579](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2229).\n\n* Switch the
  \"Run from outside project\" messages to debug-level, to\n  avoid spamming users
  in the normal case of non-project usage\n\n* If a remote package is specified (such
  as a Git repo) without an explicit\n  `extra-dep` setting, a warning is given to
  the user to provide one\n  explicitly.\n\nOther enhancements:\n\n* `stack haddock`
  now supports `--haddock-internal`. See\n  [#2229](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2229)\n*
  Add support for `system-ghc` and `install-ghc` fields to `stack config set` command.\n*
  Add `ghc-build` option to override autodetected GHC build to use (e.g. gmp4,\n  tinfo6,
  nopie) on Linux.\n* `stack setup` detects systems where gcc enables PIE by default
  (such as Ubuntu\n  16.10 and Hardened Gentoo) and adjusts the GHC `configure` options
  accordingly.\n  [#2542](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2542)\n*
  Upload to Hackage with HTTP digest instead of HTTP basic.\n* Make `stack list-dependencies`
  understand all of the `stack dot` options too.\n* Add the ability for `stack list-dependencies`
  to list dependency licenses by\n  passing the `--license` flag.\n* Dump logs that
  contain warnings for any local non-dependency packages\n  [#2545](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2545)\n*
  Add the `dump-logs` config option and `--dump-logs` command line\n  option to get
  full build output on the\n  console. [#426](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/426)\n*
  Add the `--open` option to \"stack hpc report\" command, causing the report to\n
  \ be opened in the browser.\n* The `stack config set` command now accepts a `--global`
  flag for suitable fields\n  which causes it to modify the global user configuration
  (`~/.stack/config.yaml`)\n  instead of the project configuration.\n  [#2675](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/pull/2675)\n*
  Information on the latest available snapshots is now downloaded from S3 instead
  of\n  stackage.org, increasing reliability in case of stackage.org outages.\n  [#2653](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/pull/2653)\n*
  `stack dot` and `stack list-dependencies` now take targets and flags.\n  [#1919](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1919)\n*
  Deprecate `stack setup --stack-setup-yaml` for `--setup-info-yaml` based\n  on discussion
  in [#2647](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2647).\n* The `--main-is`
  flag for GHCI now implies the TARGET, fixing\n  [#1845](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1845).\n*
  `stack ghci` no longer takes all build options, as many weren't useful\n  [#2199](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2199)\n*
  `--no-time-in-log` option, to make verbose logs more diffable\n  [#2727](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2727)\n*
  `--color` option added to override auto-detection of ANSI support\n  [#2725](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2725)\n*
  Missing extra-deps are now warned about, adding a degree of typo detection\n  [#1521](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1521)\n*
  No longer warns about missing build-tools if they are on the PATH.\n  [#2235](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2235)\n*
  Replace enclosed-exceptions with safe-exceptions.\n  [#2768](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2768)\n*
  The install location for GHC and other programs can now be configured with the\n
  \ `local-programs-path` option in `config.yaml`.\n  [#1644](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1644)\n*
  Added option to add nix dependencies as nix GC roots\n* Proper pid 1 (init) process
  for `stack exec` with Docker\n* Dump build logs if they contain warnings.\n  [#2545](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2545)\n*
  Docker: redirect stdout of `docker pull` to stderr so that\n  it will not interfere
  with output of other commands.\n* Nix & docker can be activated at the same time,
  in order to run stack in a nix-shell\n  in a container, preferably from an image
  already containing the nix dependencies\n  in its /nix/store\n* Stack/nix: Dependencies
  can be added as nix GC roots, so they are not removed\n  when running `nix-collect-garbage`\n\nBug
  fixes:\n\n* Fixed a gnarly bug where programs and package tarballs sometimes have\n
  \ corrupted downloads. See\n  [#2657](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2568).\n*
  Add proper support for non-ASCII characters in file paths for the `sdist` command.\n
  \ See [#2549](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2549)\n* Never treat
  `extra-dep` local packages as targets. This ensures\n  things like test suites are
  not run for these packages, and that\n  build output is not hidden due to their
  presence.\n* Fix a resource leak in `sinkProcessStderrStdout` which could affect\n
  \ much of the codebase, in particular copying precompiled\n  packages. [#1979](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1979)\n*
  Docker: ensure that interrupted extraction process does not cause corrupt file\n
  \ when downloading a Docker-compatible Stack executable\n  [#2568](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2568)\n*
  Fixed running `stack hpc report` on package targets.\n  [#2664](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2664)\n*
  Fix a long-standing performance regression where stack would parse the .dump-hi\n
  \ files of the library components of local packages twice.\n  [#2658](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/pull/2658)\n*
  Fixed a regression in \"stack ghci --no-load\", where it would prompt for a main\n
  \ module to load. [#2603](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/pull/2603)\n*
  Build Setup.hs files with the threaded RTS, mirroring the behavior of\n  cabal-install
  and enabling more complex build systems in those files.\n* Fixed a bug in passing
  along `--ghc-options` to ghcjs.  They were being\n  provided as `--ghc-options`
  to Cabal, when it needs to be `--ghcjs-options`.\n  [#2714](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2714)\n*
  Launch Docker from the project root regardless of the working\n  directory Stack
  is invoked from. This means paths relative to the project root\n  (e.g. environment
  files) can be specified in `stack.yaml`'s docker `run-args`.\n* `stack setup --reinstall`
  now behaves as expected.\n  [#2554](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2554)\n\n##
  1.2.0\n\nRelease notes:\n\n* On many Un*x systems, Stack can now be installed with
  a simple\n  one-liner:\n\n        wget -qO- https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh\n\n*
  The fix for\n  [#2175](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2175)\n
  \ entails that stack must perform a full clone of a large Git repo of\n  Hackage
  meta-information. The total download size is about 200 MB.\n  Please be aware of
  this when upgrading your stack installation.\n\n* If you use Mac OS X, you may want
  to delay upgrading to macOS Sierra as there\n  are reports of GHC panics when building
  some packages (including Stack\n  itself). See [#2577](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2577)\n\n*
  This version of Stack does not build on ARM or PowerPC systems (see\n  [store#37](https://github.com/fpco/store/issues/37)).
  \ Please stay with\n  version 1.1.2 for now on those architectures.  This will be
  rectified soon!\n\n* We are now releasing a\n  [statically linked Stack binary for
  64-bit Linux](https://www.stackage.org/stack/linux-x86_64-static).\n  Please try
  it and let us know if you run into any trouble on your platform.\n\n* We are planning
  some changes to our Linux releases, including dropping our\n  Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS,
  and Fedora package repositories and switching to\n  statically linked binaries.
  \ We would value your feedback in\n  [#2534](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2534).\n\nMajor
  changes:\n\n* Add `stack hoogle` command.\n  [#55](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/55)\n*
  Support for absolute file path in `url` field of `setup-info` or `--ghc-bindist`\n*
  Add support for rendering GHCi scripts targeting different GHCi like\n  applications\n
  \ [#2457](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/pull/2457)\n\nBehavior changes:\n\n*
  Remove `stack ide start` and `stack ide load-targets` commands.\n  [#2178](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2178)\n*
  Support .buildinfo files in `stack ghci`.\n  [#2242](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/pull/2242)\n*
  Support -ferror-spans syntax in GHC error messages.\n* Avoid unpacking ghc to `/tmp`\n
  \ [#996](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/996)\n* The Linux `gmp4`
  GHC bindist is no longer considered a full-fledged GHC\n  variant and can no longer
  be specified using the `ghc-variant` option,\n  and instead is treated more like
  a slightly different platform.\n\nOther enhancements:\n\n* Use the `store` package
  for binary serialization of most caches.\n* Only require minor version match for
  Docker stack exe.\n  This way, we can make patch releases for version bounds and
  similar\n  build issues without needing to upload new binaries for Docker.\n* Stack/Nix:
  Passes the right ghc derivation as an argument to the `shell.nix` when a\n  custom
  `shell.nix` is used\n  See [#2243](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2243)\n*
  Stack/Nix: Sets `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` so packages using C libs for Template Haskell
  can work\n  (See _e.g._ [this HaskellR issue](https://github.com/tweag/HaskellR/issues/253))\n*
  Parse CLI arguments and configuration files into less permissive types,\n  improving
  error messages for bad inputs.\n  [#2267](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2267)\n*
  Add the ability to explictly specify a gcc executable.\n  [#593](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/593)\n*
  Nix: No longer uses LTS mirroring in nixpkgs. Gives to nix-shell a derivation\n
  \ like `haskell.compiler.ghc801`\n  See [#2259](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2259)\n*
  Perform some subprocesses during setup concurrently, slightly speeding up most\n
  \ commands. [#2346](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/pull/2346)\n* `stack
  setup` no longer unpacks to the system temp dir on posix systems.\n  [#996](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/996)\n*
  `stack setup` detects libtinfo6 and ncurses6 and can download alternate GHC\n  bindists
  [#257](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/257)\n  [#2302](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2302).\n*
  `stack setup` detects Linux ARMv7 downloads appropriate GHC bindist\n  [#2103](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2103)\n*
  Custom `stack` binaries list dependency versions in output for `--version`.\n  See
  [#2222](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2222)\n  and [#2450](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2450).\n*

  Handle non-ASCII filenames on Windows\n  [#2491](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2491)\n*
  Avoid using multiple versions of a package in script interpreter\n  by passing package-id

  Only pre-load compiler version when using nix integration\n  [#2459](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2459)\n*
  Solver: parse cabal errors also on Windows\n  [#2502](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2502)\n*
  Allow exec and ghci commands in interpreter mode.\n  Scripts can now automatically
  open in the repl by using `exec ghci`\n  instead of `runghc` in the shebang command.\n
  \ [#2510](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2510)\n* Now consider
  a package to be dirty when an extra-source-file is changed.\n  See [#2040](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2040)\n\n##
  1.1.2\n\nRelease notes:\n\n* Official FreeBSD binaries are\n  [now available](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/#freebsd)\n
  \ [#1253](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1253).\n\nMajor changes:\n\n*
  Extensible custom snapshots implemented. These allow you to define snapshots\nwhich
  extend other snapshots. See\n[#863](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/863).
  Local file custom\nsnapshots can now be safely updated without changing their name.
  \ Remote custom\nsnapshots should still be treated as immutable.\n\nBehavior changes:\n\n*
  `stack path --compiler` was added in the last release, to yield a path to the\n
  \ compiler. Unfortunately, `--compiler` is a global option that is useful to use\n
  \ with `stack path`. The same functionality is now provided by `stack path\n  --compiler-exe`.
  See\n  [#2123](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2123)\n* For packages
  specified in terms of a git or hg repo, the hash used in the\n  location has changed.
  \ This means that existing downloads from older stack\n  versions won't be used.
  \ This is a side-effect of the fix to\n  [#2133](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2133)\n*
  `stack upgrade` no longer pays attention to local stack.yaml files, just the\n  global
  config and CLI options.\n  [#1392](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1392)\n*
  `stack ghci` now uses `:add` instead of `:load`, making it potentially work\n  better
  with user scripts. See\n  [#1888](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1888)\n\nOther
  enhancements:\n\n* Grab Cabal files via Git SHA to avoid regressions from Hackage
  revisions\n  [#2070](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/pull/2070)\n* Custom
  snapshots now support `ghc-options`.\n* Package git repos are now re-used rather
  than re-cloned. See\n  [#1620](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1620)\n*
  `DESTDIR` is filtered from environment when installing GHC. See\n  [#1460](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1460)\n*
  `stack haddock` now supports `--hadock-arguments`. See\n  [#2144](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2144)\n*
  Signing: warn if GPG_TTY is not set as per `man gpg-agent`\n\nBug fixes:\n\n* Now
  ignore project config when doing `stack init` or `stack new`. See\n  [#2110](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2110)\n*
  Packages specified by git repo can now have submodules. See\n  [#2133](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2133)\n*
  Fix of hackage index fetch retry. See re-opening of\n  [#1418](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1418#issuecomment-217633843)\n*
  HPack now picks up changes to filesystem other than package.yaml.  See\n  [#2051](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2051)\n*
  \"stack solver\" no longer suggests --omit-packages. See\n  [#2031](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2031)\n*
  Fixed an issue with building Cabal's Setup.hs. See\n  [#1356](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1356)\n*
  Package dirtiness now pays attention to deleted files. See\n  [#1841](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1841)\n*
  `stack ghci` now uses `extra-lib-dirs` and `extra-include-dirs`. See\n  [#1656](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1656)\n*
  Relative paths outside of source dir added via `qAddDependentFile` are now\n  checked
  for dirtiness. See\n  [#1982](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1982)\n*
  Signing: always use `--with-fingerprints`\n\n## 1.1.0\n\nRelease notes:\n\n* Added
  Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) Apt repo.\n* No longer uploading new versions to Fedora
  21 repo.\n\nBehavior changes:\n\n* Snapshot packages are no longer built with executable
  profiling. See\n  [#1179](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1179).\n*
  `stack init` now ignores symlinks when searching for cabal files. It also now\n
  \ ignores any directory that begins with `.` (as well as `dist` dirs) - before\n
  \ it would only ignore `.git`, `.stack-work`, and `dist`.\n* The stack executable
  is no longer built with `-rtsopts`.  Before, when\n  `-rtsopts` was enabled, stack
  would process `+RTS` options even when intended\n  for some other program, such
  as when used with `stack exec -- prog +RTS`.\n  See [#2022](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2022).\n*
  The `stack path --ghc-paths` option is deprecated and renamed to `--programs`.\n
  \ `--compiler` is added, which points directly at the compiler used in\n  the current
  project.  `--compiler-bin` points to the compiler's bin dir.\n* For consistency
  with the `$STACK_ROOT` environment variable, the\n  `stack path --global-stack-root`
  flag and the `global-stack-root` field\n  in the output of `stack path` are being
  deprecated and replaced with the\n  `stack-root` flag and output field.\n  Additionally,
  the stack root can now be specified via the\n  `--stack-root` command-line flag.
  See\n  [#1148](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1148).\n* `stack
  sig` GPG-related sub-commands were removed (folded into `upload` and\n  `sdist`)\n*
  GPG signing of packages while uploading to Hackage is now the default. Use\n  `upload
  --no-signature` if you would rather not contribute your package\n  signature. If
  you don't yet have a GPG keyset, read this\n  [blog post on GPG keys](https://fpcomplete.com/blog/2016/05/stack-security-gnupg-keys).\n
  \ We can add a stack.yaml config setting to disable signing if some people\n  desire
  it. We hope that people will sign. Later we will be adding GPG\n  signature verification
  options.\n* `stack build pkg-1.2.3` will now build even if the snapshot has a different\n
  \ package version - it is treated as an extra-dep. `stack build local-pkg-1.2.3`\n
  \ is an error even if the version number matches the local package\n  [#2028](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2028).\n*
  Having a `nix:` section no longer implies enabling nix build. This allows the\n
  \ user to globally configure whether nix is used (unless the project overrides\n
  \ the default explicitly). See\n  [#1924](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1924).\n*
  Remove deprecated valid-wanted field.\n* Docker: mount home directory in container
  [#1949](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1949).\n* Deprecate `--local-bin-path`
  instead `--local-bin`.\n* `stack image`: allow absolute source paths for `add`.\n\nOther
  enhancements:\n\n* `stack haddock --open [PACKAGE]` opens the local haddocks in
  the browser.\n* Fix too much rebuilding when enabling/disabling profiling flags.\n*
  `stack build pkg-1.0` will now build `pkg-1.0` even if the snapshot specifies\n
  \ a different version (it introduces a temporary extra-dep)\n* Experimental support
  for `--split-objs` added\n  [#1284](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1284).\n*
  `git` packages with submodules are supported by passing the `--recursive`\n  flag
  to `git clone`.\n* When using [hpack](https://github.com/sol/hpack), only regenerate
  cabal files\n  when hpack files change.\n* hpack files can now be used in templates\n*
  `stack ghci` now runs ghci as a separate process\n  [#1306](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1306)\n*
  Retry when downloading snapshots and package indices\n* Many build options are configurable
  now in `stack.yaml`:\n```\n  build:\n    library-profiling: true\n    executable-profiling:
  true\n    haddock: true\n    haddock-deps: true\n    copy-bins: true\n    prefetch:
  true\n    force-dirty: true\n    keep-going: true\n    test: true\n    test-arguments:\n

  \     no-run-tests: true\n    bench: true\n    benchmark-opts:\n      benchmark-arguments:
  -O2\n      no-run-benchmarks: true\n    reconfigure: true\n    cabal-verbose: true\n```\n*
  A number of URLs are now configurable, useful for firewalls. See\n  [#1794](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1884).\n*
  Suggest causes when executables are missing.\n* Allow `--omit-packages` even without
  `--solver`.\n* Improve the generated stack.yaml.\n* Improve ghci results after :load
  Main module collision with main file path.\n* Only load the hackage index if necessary\n

  file [#921](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/921)\n  [#1805](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1805).\n*
  Now considers a package to dirty when the hpack file is changed\n  [#1819](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1819).\n*
  Nix: cancelling a stack build now exits properly rather than dropping into a\n  nix-shell
  [#1778](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1778).\n* `allow-newer:
  true` now causes `--exact-configuration` to be passed to Cabal.\n  See [#1579](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1579).\n*
  `stack solver` no longer fails with `InvalidRelFile` for relative package\n  paths
  including `..`. See\n  [#1954](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1954).\n*
  Ignore emacs lock files when finding .cabal\n  [#1897](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1897).\n*

  1.0.4.2\n\nBuild with path-io-1.0.0. There are no changes in behaviour from 1.0.4,\nso
  no binaries are released for this version.\n\n## 1.0.4.1\n\nFixes build with aeson-0.11.0.0.
  There are no changes in behaviour from 1.0.4,\nso no binaries are released for this
  version.\n\n## 1.0.4\n\nMajor changes:\n\n* Some notable changes in `stack init`:\n
  \   * Overall it should now be able to initialize almost all existing cabal\n      packages
  out of the box as long as the package itself is consistently\n      defined.\n    *
  Choose the best possible snapshot and add extra dependencies on top\n      of a
  snapshot resolver rather than a compiler resolver -\n      [#1583](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/pull/1583)\n
  \   * Automatically omit a package (`--omit-packages`) when it is compiler\n      incompatible
  or when there are packages with conflicting dependency\n      requirements - [#1674](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/pull/1674).\n
  \   * Some more changes for a better user experience. Please refer to\n      the
  doc guide for details.\n* Add support for hpack, alternative package description
  format\n  [#1679](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1679)\n\nOther
  enhancements:\n\n* Docker: pass ~/.ssh and SSH auth socket into container, so that
  git repos\n  work [#1358](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1358).\n*
  Docker: strip suffix from docker --version.\n  [#1653](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1653)\n*
  Docker: pass USER and PWD environment variables into container.\n* On each run,
  stack will test the stack root directory (~/.stack), and the\n  project and package
  work directories (.stack-work) for whether they are\n  owned by the current user
  and abort if they are not. This precaution can\n  be disabled with the `--allow-different-user`
  flag or `allow-different-user`\n  option in the global config (~/.stack/config.yaml).\n
  \ [#471](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/471)\n* Added `stack
  clean --full` option for full working dir cleanup.\n* YAML config: support Zip archives.\n*
  Redownload build plan if parsing fails\n  [#1702](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1702).\n*
  Give mustache templates access to a 'year' tag\n  [#1716](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/pull/1716).\n*
  Have \"stack ghci\" warn about module name aliasing.\n* Add \"stack ghci --load-local-deps\".\n*
  Build Setup.hs with -rtsopts\n  [#1687](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1687).\n*
  `stack init` accepts a list of directories.\n* Add flag infos to DependencyPlanFailures
  (for better error output in case of\n  flags) [#713](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/713)\n*
  `stack new --bare` complains for overwrites, and add `--force` option\n  [#1597](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1597).\n\nBug
  fixes:\n\n* Previously, `stack ghci` would fail with `cannot satisfy -package-id`
  when the\n  implicit build step changes the package key of some dependency.\n* Fix:
  Building with ghcjs: \"ghc-pkg: Prelude.chr: bad argument: 2980338\"\n  [#1665](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1665).\n*
  Fix running test / bench with `--profile` / `--trace`.\n* Fix: build progress counter
  is no longer visible\n  [#1685](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1685).\n*
  Use \"-RTS\" w/ profiling to allow extra args\n  [#1772](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1772).\n*
  Fix withUnpackedTarball7z to find name of srcDir after unpacking\n  (fixes `stack
  setup` fails for ghcjs project on windows)\n  [#1774](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1774).\n*
  Add space before auto-generated bench opts (makes profiling options work\n  uniformly
  for applications and benchmark suites)\n  [#1771](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1771).\n*
  Don't try to find plugin if it resembles flag.\n* Setup.hs changes cause package
  dirtiness\n  [#1711](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1711).\n*
  Send \"stack templates\" output to stdout\n  [#1792](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1792).\n\n##

  1.0.0\n\nRelease notes:\n\n*  We're calling this version 1.0.0 in preparation for
  Stackage\n   LTS 4.  Note, however, that this does not mean the code's API\n   will
  be stable as this is primarily an end-user tool.\n\nEnhancements:\n\n* Added flag
  `--profile` flag: passed with `stack build`, it will\n  enable profiling, and for
  `--bench` and `--test` it will generate a\n  profiling report by passing `+RTS -p`
  to the executable(s). Great\n  for using like `stack build --bench --profile` (remember
  that\n  enabling profile will slow down your benchmarks by >4x). Run `stack\n  build
  --bench` again to disable the profiling and get proper speeds\n* Added flag `--trace`
  flag: just like `--profile`, it enables\n  profiling, but instead of generating
  a report for `--bench` and\n  `--test`, prints out a stack trace on exception. Great
  for using\n  like `stack build --test --trace`\n* Nix: all options can be overriden
  on command line\n  [#1483](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1483)\n*
  Nix: build environments (shells) are now pure by default.\n* Make verbosity silent
  by default in script interpreter mode\n  [#1472](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1472)\n*
  Show a message when resetting git commit fails\n  [#1453](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1453)\n*
  Improve Unicode handling in project/package names\n  [#1337](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1337)\n*
  Fix ambiguity between a stack command and a filename to execute (prefer\n  `stack`
  subcommands)\n  [#1471](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1471)\n*
  Support multi line interpreter directive comments\n  [#1394](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1394)\n*
  Handle space separated pids in ghc-pkg dump (for GHC HEAD)\n  [#1509](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1509)\n*

  \ which shows the documentation rendered by readthedocs.org. Note: this\n  has necessitated
  some changes to the links in the documentation's markdown\n  source code, so please

  revision invalidates a build plan in a snapshot, trust the\n  snapshot [#770](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/770)\n*
  Added a `stack config set resolver RESOLVER` command. Part of work on\n  [#115](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/115)\n*
  `stack setup` can now install GHCJS on windows. See\n  [#1145](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1145)

  report` command added, which generates reports for HPC tix files\n* `stack ghci`
  now accepts all the flags accepted by `stack build`. See\n  [#1186](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1186)\n*
  `stack ghci` builds the project before launching GHCi. If the build fails,\n  optimistically
  launch GHCi anyway. Use `stack ghci --no-build` option to\n  disable [#1065](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1065)\n*
  `stack ghci` now detects and warns about various circumstances where it is\n  liable
  to fail. See\n  [#1270](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1270)\n*
  Added `require-docker-version` configuration option\n* Packages will now usually
  be built along with their tests and benchmarks. See\n  [#1166](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1166)\n*
  Relative `local-bin-path` paths will be relative to the project's root\n  directory,

  0.1.6.0\n\nMajor changes:\n\n* `stack setup` now supports building and booting GHCJS
  from source tarball.\n* On Windows, build directories no longer display \"pretty\"
  information\n  (like x86_64-windows/Cabal-1.22.4.0), but rather a hash of that\n
  \ content. The reason is to avoid the 260 character path limitation on\n  Windows.
  See\n  [#1027](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/pull/1027)\n* Rename config
  files and clarify their purposes [#969](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/969)\n
  \   * `~/.stack/stack.yaml` --> `~/.stack/config.yaml`\n    * `~/.stack/global`
  --> `~/.stack/global-project`\n    * `/etc/stack/config` --> `/etc/stack/config.yaml`\n
  \   * Old locations still supported, with deprecation warnings\n* New command \"stack
  eval CODE\", which evaluates to \"stack exec ghc -- -e CODE\".\n\nOther enhancements:\n\n*
  No longer install `git` on Windows\n  [#1046](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1046).
  You\n  can still get this behavior by running the following yourself:\n  `stack
  exec -- pacman -Sy --noconfirm git`.\n* Typing enter during --file-watch triggers
  a rebuild [#1023](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/pull/1023)\n* Use Haddock's
  `--hyperlinked-source` (crosslinked source), if available [#1070](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/pull/1070)\n*
  Use Stack-installed GHCs for `stack init --solver` [#1072](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1072)\n*
  New experimental `stack query` command [#1087](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1087)\n*
  By default, stack no longer rebuilds a package due to GHC options changes. This
  behavior can be tweaked with the `rebuild-ghc-options` setting. [#1089](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1089)\n*
  By default, ghc-options are applied to all local packages, not just targets. This
  behavior can be tweaked with the `apply-ghc-options` setting. [#1089](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1089)\n*
  Docker: download or override location of stack executable to re-run in container
  [#974](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/974)\n* Docker: when Docker
  Engine is remote, don't run containerized processes as host's UID/GID [#194](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/194)\n*
  Docker: `set-user` option to enable/disable running containerized processes as host's
  UID/GID [#194](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/194)\n* Custom
  Setup.hs files are now precompiled instead of interpreted. This should be a major
  performance win for certain edge cases (biggest example: [building Cabal itself](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1041))
  while being either neutral or a minor slowdown for more common cases.\n* `stack
  test --coverage` now also generates a unified coverage report for multiple test-suites
  / packages.  In the unified report, test-suites can contribute to the coverage of
  other packages.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n* Ignore stack-built executables named `ghc`\n
  \ [#1052](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1052)\n* Fix quoting
  of output failed command line arguments\n* Mark executable-only packages as installed
  when copied from cache [#1043](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/pull/1043)\n*
  Canonicalize temporary directory paths [#1047](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/pull/1047)\n*
  Put code page fix inside the build function itself [#1066](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1066)\n*
  Add `explicit-setup-deps` option [#1110](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1110),
  and change the default to the old behavior of using any package in the global and
  snapshot database [#1025](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1025)\n*
  Precompiled cache checks full package IDs on Cabal < 1.22 [#1103](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1103)\n*
  Pass -package-id to ghci [#867](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/867)\n*
  Ignore global packages when copying precompiled packages [#1146](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1146)\n\n##
  0.1.5.0\n\nMajor changes:\n\n* On Windows, we now use a full MSYS2 installation
  in place of the previous PortableGit. This gives you access to the pacman package
  manager for more easily installing libraries.\n* Support for custom GHC binary distributions
  [#530](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/530)\n    * `ghc-variant`
  option in stack.yaml to specify the variant (also\n      `--ghc-variant` command-line
  option)\n    * `setup-info` in stack.yaml, to specify where to download custom binary\n
  \     distributions (also `--ghc-bindist` command-line option)\n    * Note: On systems
  with libgmp4 (aka `libgmp.so.3`), such as CentOS 6, you\n      may need to re-run
  `stack setup` due to the centos6 GHC bindist being\n      treated like a variant\n*
  A new `--pvp-bounds` flag to the sdist and upload commands allows automatic adding
  of PVP upper and/or lower bounds to your dependencies\n\nOther enhancements:\n\n*
  Adapt to upcoming Cabal installed package identifier format change [#851](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/851)\n*
  `stack setup` takes a `--stack-setup-yaml` argument\n* `--file-watch` is more discerning
  about which files to rebuild for [#912](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/912)\n*
  `stack path` now supports `--global-pkg-db` and `--ghc-package-path`\n* `--reconfigure`
  flag [#914](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/914) [#946](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/946)\n*
  Cached data is written with a checksum of its structure [#889](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/889)\n*
  Fully removed `--optimizations` flag\n* Added `--cabal-verbose` flag\n* Added `--file-watch-poll`
  flag for polling instead of using filesystem events (useful for running tests in
  a Docker container while modifying code in the host environment. When code is injected
  into the container via a volume, the container won't propagate filesystem events).\n*
  Give a preemptive error message when `-prof` is given as a GHC option [#1015](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1015)\n*
  Locking is now optional, and will be turned on by setting the `STACK_LOCK` environment
  variable to `true` [#950](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/950)\n*
  Create default stack.yaml with documentation comments and commented out options
  [#226](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/226)\n* Out of memory warning
  if Cabal exits with -9 [#947](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/947)\n\nBug
  fixes:\n\n* Hacky workaround for optparse-applicative issue with `stack exec --help`
  [#806](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/806)\n* Build executables
  for local extra deps [#920](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/920)\n*
  copyFile can't handle directories [#942](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/pull/942)\n*
  Support for spaces in Haddock interface files [fpco/minghc#85](https://github.com/fpco/minghc/issues/85)\n*
  Temporarily building against a \"shadowing\" local package? [#992](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/992)\n*
  Fix Setup.exe name for --upgrade-cabal on Windows [#1002](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1002)\n*
  Unlisted dependencies no longer trigger extraneous second build [#838](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/838)\n\n##
  0.1.4.1\n\nFix stack's own Haddocks.  No changes to functionality (only comments
  updated).\n\n## 0.1.4.0\n\nMajor changes:\n\n* You now have more control over how
  GHC versions are matched, e.g. \"use exactly this version,\" \"use the specified
  minor version, but allow patches,\" or \"use the given minor version or any later
  minor in the given major release.\" The default has switched from allowing newer
  later minor versions to a specific minor version allowing patches. For more information,
  see [#736](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/736) and [#784](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/pull/784).\n*
  Support added for compiling with GHCJS\n* stack can now reuse prebuilt binaries
  between snapshots. That means that, if you build package foo in LTS-3.1, that binary
  version can be reused in LTS-3.2, assuming it uses the same dependencies and flags.
  [#878](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/878)\n\nOther enhancements:\n\n*
  Added the `--docker-env` argument, to set environment variables in Docker container.\n*
  Set locale environment variables to UTF-8 encoding for builds to avoid \"commitBuffer:
  invalid argument\" errors from GHC [#793](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/793)\n*
  Enable translitation for encoding on stdout and stderr [#824](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/824)\n*
  By default, `stack upgrade` automatically installs GHC as necessary [#797](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/797)\n*
  Added the `ghc-options` field to stack.yaml [#796](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/796)\n*
  Added the `extra-path` field to stack.yaml\n* Code page changes on Windows only
  apply to the build command (and its synonyms), and can be controlled via a command
  line flag (still defaults to on) [#757](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/757)\n*
  Implicitly add packages to extra-deps when a flag for them is set [#807](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/807)\n*

  `stack solver` and `stack init --solver` check for test suite and benchmark dependencies
  [#862](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/862)\n* More intelligent
  logic for setting UTF-8 locale environment variables [#856](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/856)\n*
