  ## [_Unreleased_](https://github.com/freckle/stackctl/compare/v1.1.0.3...main)

  ## [v1.1.0.3](https://github.com/freckle/stackctl/compare/v1.1.0.2...v1.1.0.3)

  - Require Blammo-1.1.1.0

  ## [v1.1.0.2](https://github.com/freckle/stackctl/compare/v1.1.0.1...v1.1.0.2)

  - Log responses from `awsLambdaInvoke` when running actions
  - Clarify discovery logging
  - Add install script

  ## [v1.1.0.1](https://github.com/freckle/stackctl/compare/v1.1.0.0...v1.1.0.1)

  - Update to `cfn-flip-0.1.0.3`

  ## [v1.1.0.0](https://github.com/freckle/stackctl/compare/v1.0.2.0...v1.1.0.0)

  - Fix interleaved or out-of-order output bugs by streaming deployment events
    through the Logger instead of directly to `stdout`
  - Logging goes to `stdout` by default (`LOG_DESTINATION` can still be used)
  - The `changes` subcommand now requires a `PATH` argument

  ## [v1.0.2.0](https://github.com/freckle/stackctl/compare/v1.0.1.2...v1.0.2.0)

  - Add `Stackctl.Action`

    Support for taking actions during Stack management, currently we support
    invoking a lambda post-deployment. In the future, we can add more, such as
    running local pre-deploy validation or preparation scripts.

  - Add `awsCloudFormationDescribeStackOutputs`

  ## [v1.0.1.2](https://github.com/freckle/stackctl/compare/v1.0.1.1...v1.0.1.2)

  - Always flush log messages before our own output

  ## [v1.0.1.1](https://github.com/freckle/stackctl/compare/v1.0.1.0...v1.0.1.1)

  - Respect `LOG_DESTINATION` (the default remains `stderr`)

  ## [v1.0.1.0](https://github.com/freckle/stackctl/compare/v1.0.0.2...v1.0.1.0)

  - Support reading CloudGenesis specifications

    - Accept account paths like `id.name` or `name.id`
    - Read `Parameters` as `Parameter{Key,Value}` or `{Name,Value}`

    This allows us to work with specifications directories originally implemented
    for, and potentially still used with, the CloudGenesis tooling.

  ## [v1.0.0.2](https://github.com/freckle/stackctl/compare/v1.0.0.1...v1.0.0.2)

  - Fix tailing all events to read most recent, causing Throttling errors

  ## [v1.0.0.1](https://github.com/freckle/stackctl/compare/v1.0.0.0...v1.0.0.1)

  - Fix non-portable paths issue in OSX executable build

  ## [v1.0.0.0](https://github.com/freckle/stackctl/tree/v1.0.0.0)

  # Stackctl

  Manage CloudFormation Stacks through specifications.

  ## About

  `stackctl` is a command-line tool for working with [Stack Specifications][spec]. A Stack
  Specification is a file-system format for describing deployed (or
  to-be-deployed) CloudFormation Stacks including the Template, Parameters, and
  Tags. `stackctl` can be used to pretty-print, diff, and deploy these
  specifications.

  [spec]: https://github.com/freckle/stackctl/blob/main/doc/stackctl.1.md#stack-specifications

  This project also contains a Haskell library for doing the same.

  ## Install

  ### Pre-requisites

  - Have `~/.local/bin` on your `$PATH`
  - Have `~/.local/share/man` on your `$MANPATH` (for documentation)
  - If on OSX, `brew install coreutils` (i.e. have `ginstall` available)

  ### Scripted

  ```console
  curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freckle/stackctl/main/install | bash
  ```

  **NOTE**: some in the community have expressed [concerns][curlsh-bad] about the
  security of so-called "curl-sh" installations. We think the argument has been
  [pretty well debunked][curlsh-ok], but feel free to use the manual steps
  instead.

  [curlsh-bad]: https://0x46.net/thoughts/2019/04/27/piping-curl-to-shell/
  [curlsh-ok]: https://www.arp242.net/curl-to-sh.html

  ### Manual

  Go to the [latest release][latest] and download the `.tar.gz` asset appropriate
  for your OS. Navigate to the directory containing the downloaded file and run:

  [latest]: https://github.com/freckle/stackctl/releases/latest

  ```console
  tar xvf stackctl-*.tar.gz
  cd stackctl
  ```

  User installation:

  ```console
  make install PREFIX="$HOME/.local"
  ```

  Global installation

  ```console
  sudo make install
  ```

  ## Usage

  Once installed, see:

  - `stackctl --help`,
  - `stackctl <command> --help`,
  - `man 1 stackctl`, or
  - `man 1 stackctl <command>`

  The man pages are also available [in-repository](./doc), but contain
  documentation as of `main`, and not your installed version.

  ## Relationship to CloudGenesis

  [CloudGenesis][] is a project that also takes a directory of Stack
  Specifications and deploys them when changed. Its on-disk format inspired ours
  and, in fact, directories built for CloudGenesis can be managed by `stackctl`
  (not necessarily the other way around).

  [cloudgenesis]: https://github.com/LifeWay/CloudGenesis

  The key differences are:

  - CloudGenesis supplies AWS CodeBuild tooling for handling changes to your
    GitOps repository; Stackctl expects you to implement a GitHub Action that
    installs and executes `stackctl` commands as appropriate

    This makes Stackctl better if you need or want to also run the same tooling in
    a local context, but it makes CloudGenesis better if you need or want this
    activity to remain within the boundaries of your AWS VPC.

  - CloudGenesis reacts to file-change events in S3, which only happens when you
    synchronize from `main`; Stackctl can run on any branch and easily be scoped
    to files changed in the PR or push.

    This enables Stackctl features like commenting with ChangeSet details on PRs,
    which are not possible in CloudGenesis as it's currently implemented.

  - Stackctl adds the `Depends` key, for ordering multi-Stack processing
