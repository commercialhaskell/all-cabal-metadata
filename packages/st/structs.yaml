changelog: |
  ## 0.1.6 [2021.04.30]
  * Make the test suite compile on recent GHCs.

  ## 0.1.5 [2021.02.17]
  * The build-type has been changed from `Custom` to `Simple`.
    To achieve this, the `doctests` test suite has been removed in favor of using
    [`cabal-docspec`](https://github.com/phadej/cabal-extras/tree/master/cabal-docspec)
    to run the doctests.

  ## 0.1.4 [2020.10.02]
  * Allow building with `template-haskell-2.17.0.0` (GHC 9.0).

  ## 0.1.3 [2020.01.29]
  * Achieve forward compatibility with
    [GHC proposal 229](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0229-whitespace-bang-patterns.rst).

  ## 0.1.2 [2019.05.02]
  * Add a unit test suite.

  ## 0.1.1
  * Add a library dependency in the `doctests` test suite

  ## 0.1
  * Add compare-and-swap support for struct slots
  * Add `Data.Struct.TH`, which provides Template Haskell support for
    generating structs
  * Remove unneeded proxy argument to `struct`
  * Add a type parameter to `Order`
  * Revamp `Setup.hs` to use `cabal-doctest`. This makes it build
    with `Cabal-2.0`, and makes the `doctest`s work with `cabal new-build` and
    sandboxes.

  ## 0
  * Repository initialized
  * Added structures for list labeling, order-maintenance, and link-cut trees.

  ==========

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/structs.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/structs) [![Build Status](https://github.com/ekmett/structs/workflows/Haskell-CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ekmett/structs/actions?query=workflow%3AHaskell-CI)

  This package explores strict mutable data structures in Haskell.

  In particular, pointer-based data structures are effectively 'half price' due to the encoding used.

  However, the result is that if you use the `slot` and `field` system wrong, you can and will `SEGFAULT`.

  This means the `Internal` modules are very much internal.

  Some documentation is available at
  [http://ekmett.github.io/structs/Data-Struct.html](http://ekmett.github.io/structs/Data-Struct.html)


  Examples
  --------

  ## Non-recursive data types


  We use the template haskell helper `makeStruct` to automatically convert
  a Haskell `data` definition to a `Struct`.


  As an example, we create a type that mimics a tuple of integers.

  ```hs
  makeStruct [d|
    data TupleInts a s  = TupleInts
      { tupleLeft, tupleRight :: a
      }
      |]
  ```
  This declaration uses `makeStruct`, which will generate a bunch of
  helper functions for us to use.


  Notice the extra type parameter `s` in `TupleInts a s`. This is used to
  carry around state information by `structs`, and so is mandatory.


  ```hs
  -- Create a new tuple of ints.
  mkTupleInts :: PrimMonad m => Int -> Int -> m (TupleInts a (PrimState m))
  mkTupleInts a b = st newTupleInts a b
  ```

  `newTupleInts` is a function that was auto-generated by `makeStructs`, whose
  parameters are all the fields, which returns a `TupleInts` within a
  `PrimMonad` context. Notice the use of `PrimState m` for the state
  type parameter of `TupleInts`, which is used to carry the state around.


  ```hs
  -- set the left element of the tuple
  setTupleLeft :: PrimMonad m => TupleInts a (PrimState m) -> a -> m ()
  setTupleLeft tup val = setField tupleLeft tup val

  -- get the left element of the tuple
  getTupleLeft :: PrimMonad m => TupleInts a (PrimState m) -> m a
  getTupleLeft tup = getField tupleLeft tup
  ```


  The Template Haskell generates `tupleLeft, tupleRight :: Field (TupleInts a) a`, which
  can be used to get and set fields with `getField, setField`. The type signature
  indicates that `tupleLeft, tupleRight` extract an `a` from a `TupleInts a`.


  ## Recursive data types

  We identify recursive members of a struct with `Slot`s. These are like

  ```hs
  makeStruct [d|
    data LinkedList a s  = LinkedList
      { val :: a,
         next :: !(LinkedList a s) }
      |]
  ```

  for this definition, `makeStruct` auto-generates
  `next :: Slot (LinkedList a s) (LinkedList a s)`.
  Similar to the case of `Field`, the type tells us that `next` extracts
  a `LinkedList a s` from a `LinkedList a s`


  ```
  -- Make an empty linked list
  mkEmptyLinkedList ::  LinkedList a s
  mkEmptyLinkedList = Nil
  ```

  `Nil` is a special value which can be assigned to any `Struct`.


  ```hs
  -- Make a linked list node with a value
  mkLinkedListNode :: PrimMonad m => a -> m (LinkedList a (PrimState m))
  mkLinkedListNode a = newLinkedList a Nil
  ```
  Once again, `newLinkedList` is auto-generated by `makeStruct` which we
  use to initialize the linked list.

  ```
  -- Append a node to a linked list.
  appendLinkedList :: PrimMonad m =>
    LinkedList x (PrimState m)
    -> x
    -> m (LinkedList x (PrimState m))
  appendLinkedList xs x = do
    isend <- isNil <$> (get next xs)
    if isend
       then do
         nodex <- mkLinkedListNode x
         set next xs nodex
         return xs
        else do
          xs' <- get next xs
          appendLinkedList xs' x
  makeStruct [d|
    data LinkedList a s  = LinkedList
      { val :: a,
         next :: !(LinkedList a s) }
      |]

  -- Make an empty linked list
  mkEmptyLinkedList ::  LinkedList a s
  mkEmptyLinkedList = Nil

  -- Make a linked list node with a value
  mkLinkedListNode :: PrimMonad m => a -> m (LinkedList a (PrimState m))
  mkLinkedListNode a = newLinkedList a Nil

  -- Append a node to a linked list.
  appendLinkedList :: PrimMonad m =>
    LinkedList x (PrimState m)
    -> x
    -> m (LinkedList x (PrimState m))
  appendLinkedList xs x = do
    isend <- isNil <$> (get next xs)
    if isend
       then do
         nodex <- mkLinkedListNode x
         set next xs nodex
         return xs
        else do
          xs' <- get next xs
          appendLinkedList xs' x
  ```

  The rest is straightforward uses of `get`, `set`, `getField`, and `setField` to
  manipulate the linked list as usual.


  FAQ
  ---

  1. Why can fields not be strict? (compiler error)
  2. How do I free memory once `alloc`d?
