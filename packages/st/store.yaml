  # ChangeLog

  ## 0.7.0

  * Fixes a bug where the `Store` instances for `Identity`, `Const`, and
    `Complex` all have `Storable` superclasses instead of `Store. See
    [#143][].

  [#143]: https://github.com/fpco/store/issues/143

  ## 0.6.1

  * Can now optionally be built with `integer-simple` instead of
    `integer-gmp`, via the `integer-simple` cabal flag.  Note that the
    serialization of `Integer` with `integer-simple` differs from what
    is used by the GMP default. See [#147][].

  [#147]: https://github.com/fpco/store/pull/147

  ## 0.6.0.1

  * Now builds with GHC-7.10 - compatibility was broken in 0.6.0 due to
    the fix for GHC-8.8. See
    [#146][https://github.com/fpco/store/issues/146].

  ## 0.6.0

  * Now builds with GHC-8.8. This is a major version bump because
    MonadFail constraints were added to some functions, which is
    potentially a breaking change.

  ## 0.5.1.2

  * Fixes compilation with GHC < 8.0.  See
    [#142](https://github.com/fpco/store/issues/142).

  ## 0.5.1.1

  * Update to the instances for generics, to improve error messages for
    sum types with more than 255 constructors.  See
    [#141](https://github.com/fpco/store/issues/141)

  ## 0.5.1.0

  * Update to TH to support sum types with more than 62 constructors.

  * Uses TH to derive Either instance, so that it can sometimes have ConstSize #119.

  ## 0.5.0.1

  * Updates to test-suite enabling `store` to build with newer dependencies.

  ## 0.5.0

  * `Data.Store.Streaming` moved to a separate package, `store-streaming`.

  ## 0.4.3.2

  * Buildable with GHC 8.2

  * Fix to haddock formatting of Data.Store.TH code example

  ## 0.4.3.1

  * Fixed compilation on GHC 7.8

  ## 0.4.3

  * Less aggressive inlining, resulting in faster compilation / simplifier
    not running out of ticks

  ## 0.4.2

  * Fixed testsuite

  ## 0.4.1

  * Breaking change in the encoding of Map / Set / IntMap / IntSet,
    to use ascending key order. Attempting to decode data written by
    prior versions of store (and vice versa) will almost always fail
    with a decent error message. If you're unlucky enough to have a
    collision in the data with a random Word32 magic number, then the
    error may not be so clear, or in extremely rare cases,
    successfully decode, yielding incorrect results. See
    [#97](https://github.com/fpco/store/issues/97) and
    [#101](https://github.com/fpco/store/pull/101).


  * Performance improvement of the 'Peek' monad, by introducing more
    strictness.  This required a change to the internal API.

  * API and behavior of 'Data.Store.Version' changed. Previously, it
    would check the version tag after decoding the contents. It now
    also stores a magic Word32 tag at the beginning, so that it fails
    more gracefully when decoding input that lacks encoded version
    info.

  ## 0.4.0

  Deprecated in favor of 0.4.1

  ## 0.3.1

  * Fix to derivation of primitive vectors, only relevant when built with
    primitive-0.6.2.0 or later

  * Removes INLINE pragmas on the generic default methods.  This
    dramatically improves compilation time on recent GHC versions.
    See [#91](https://github.com/fpco/store/issues/91).

  * Adds `instance Contravariant Size`

  ## 0.3

  * Uses store-core-0.3.*, which has support for alignment sensitive
    architectures.

  * Adds support for streaming decode from file descriptor, not supported on
    windows. As part of this addition, the API for "Data.Store.Streaming" has
    changed.

  ## 0.2.1.2

  * Fixes a bug that could could result in attempting to malloc a negative
    number of bytes when reading corrupted data.

  ## 0.2.1.1

  * Fixes a bug that could result in segfaults when reading corrupted data.

  ## 0.2.1.0

  Release notes:

  * Adds experimental `Data.Store.Version` and deprecates `Data.Store.TypeHash`.
    The new functionality is similar to TypeHash, but there are much fewer false
    positives of hashes changing.

  Other enhancements:

  * Now exports types related to generics

  ## 0.2.0.0

  Release notes:

  * Core functionality split into `store-core` package

  Breaking changes:

  * `combineSize'` renamed to `combineSizeWith`

  * Streaming support now prefixes each Message with a magic number, intended to
    detect mis-alignment of data frames. This is worth the overhead, because
    otherwise serialization errors could be more catastrophic - interpretting some
    bytes as a length tag and attempting to consume many bytes from the source.

  Other enhancements:

  * [weigh](https://github.com/fpco/weigh) based allocations benchmark.

  * Addition of `Array` / `UArray` instances

  * Streaming support now has checks for over/undershooting buffer

  Bug fixes:


  ## 0.1.0.0

  * First public release

  # store

  The 'store' package provides efficient binary serialization. There are a couple
  features that particularly distinguish it from most prior Haskell serialization
  libraries:

  * Its primary goal is speed. By default, direct machine representations are used
    for things like numeric values (`Int`, `Double`, `Word32`, etc) and buffers
    (`Text`, `ByteString`, `Vector`, etc). This means that much of serialization
    uses the equivalent of `memcpy`.

    We have plans for supporting architecture independent serialization - see
    [#36](https://github.com/fpco/store/issues/36) and
    [#31](https://github.com/fpco/store/issues/31). This plan makes little endian
    the default, so that the most common endianness has no overhead.

    - Another way that the serialization behavior can vary is if
      integer-simple is used instead of GHC's default of using
      GMP. `Integer` serialized with the `integer-simple` flag enabled
      are not compatible with those serialized without the flag enabled.

  * Instead of implementing lazy serialization / deserialization involving
    multiple input / output buffers, `peek` and `poke` always work with a single
    buffer. This buffer is allocated by asking the value for its size before
    encoding. This simplifies the encoding logic, and allows for highly optimized
    tight loops.

  * `store` can optimize size computations by knowing when some types always
    use the same number of bytes.  This allows us to compute the byte size of a
    `Vector Int32` by just doing `length v * 4`.

  It also features:

  * Optimized serialization instances for many types from base, vector,
    bytestring, text, containers, time, template-haskell, and more.

  * TH and GHC Generics based generation of Store instances for datatypes

  * TH generation of testcases.

  * Utilities for streaming encoding / decoding of Store encoded messages, via the
    `store-streaming` package.
