  # Strict Mutable Variables

  The `strict-mvar` package provides a strict interface to mutable variables
  (`MVar`). It builds on top of `io-classes`, and thus it provides the interface
  for `MVar`s implementations from both
  [base](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.17.0.0/docs/Control-Concurrent-MVar.html)
  and [io-sim](https://github.com/input-output-hk/io-sim).
