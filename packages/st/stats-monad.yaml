description: "This package implements an unnormalized distribution monad `P`\ndesigned
  for discrete probabilistic computations. The inference is \nexact by enumerating
  all possibilities, which means it is slow and \nis not meant for big programs. However,
  the ability to enumerate\nover the support of a program means we can provide primitives
  for \ncomputing statistical properties such as independence/moments of \nrandom
  variables."
