description: "  # StrictCheck: Keep Your Laziness In Check\n  \n  StrictCheck is a
  property-based random testing framework for\n  observing, specifying, and testing
  the strictness behaviors of Haskell\n  functions. Strictness behavior is traditionally
  considered a non-functional\n  property; StrictCheck allows it to be tested as if
  it were one, by reifying\n  demands on data structures so they can be manipulated
  and examined within\n  Haskell.\n  \n  For details, see the library on Hackage:
  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/StrictCheck>.\n"
