  Strongly typed file paths in Haskell.

  This library provides a strongly typed representation of file paths, providing more safety during compile time while also making code more readable, compared to the standard solution (`FilePath`, which is really just `String`).

  Without `StrongPath`:
  ```hs
  getBashProfile :: IO FilePath
  ```

  With `StrongPath`:
  ```hs
  getBashProfile :: IO (Path System (Rel HomeDir) (File BashProfile))
  ```

  Simple but complete example:
  ```hs
  import StrongPath (Path, System, Abs, Dir, parseAbsDir)

  data HomeDir

  getHomeDirPath :: IO (Path System Abs (Dir HomeDir))
  getHomeDirPath = getLine >>= fromJust . parseAbsDir
  ```

  Check [documentation](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/strong-path/docs/StrongPath.html) for more details!

  ## Documentation
  Detailed documentation, including rich examples and API is written via Haddock.

  Check out the latest documentation on Hackage: [Documentation](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/strong-path/docs/StrongPath.html).

  You can also build and view the Haddock documentation yourself if you wish, by running `stack haddock --open`.

  ## Contributing / development
  We are using `ormolu` for code formatting. In order for the PR to pass, it needs to be formatted by `ormolu`.

  `strong-path` is `Stack` project, so make sure you have `stack` installed on your machine.

  `stack build` to build the project, `stack test` to run the tests.

  `stack build --file-watch --haddock` to rebuild documentation as you change it.

  ### Publishing to Hackage

  `stack sdist` to build publishable .tar.gz., and then we need to upload it manually to Hackage.

  Check if Hackage correctly built the Haddock docs -> if not, you need to upload them manually (check Hackage webpage for instructions, it should be smth like `cabal v2-haddock --haddock-for-hackage --enable-doc` and then `cabal upload -d --publish <path_to_docs.tar.gz>`).

  Make sure to update the version of package in package.yaml.

  We should also tag the commit in git with version tag (e.g. v1.0.0.0) so we know which version of code was used to produce that release.
