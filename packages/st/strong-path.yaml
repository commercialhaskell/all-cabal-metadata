  Strongly typed file paths in Haskell.

  This library provides a strongly typed representation of file paths, providing more safety during compile time while also making code more readable, compared to the standard solution (`FilePath`, which is really just `String`).

  Without `StrongPath`:
  ```hs
  getBashProfile :: IO FilePath
  ```

  With `StrongPath`:
  ```hs
  getBashProfile :: IO (Path System (Rel HomeDir) (File BashProfile))
  ```

  Simple but complete example:
  ```hs
  import StrongPath (Path, System, Abs, Dir, parseAbsDir)

  data HomeDir

  getHomeDirPath :: IO (Path System Abs (Dir HomeDir))
  getHomeDirPath = getLine >>= fromJust . parseAbsDir
  ```

  Check [documentation](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/strong-path/docs/StrongPath.html) for more details!

  ## Documentation
  Detailed documentation, including rich examples and API is written via Haddock.

  Check out the latest documentation on Hackage: [Documentation](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/strong-path/docs/StrongPath.html).

  You can also build and view the Haddock documentation yourself if you wish, by running `stack haddock --open`.

  ## Contributing / development
  We are using `ormolu` for code formatting. In order for the PR to pass, it needs to be formatted by `ormolu`.

  `strong-path` is `Stack` project, so make sure you have `stack` installed on your machine.

  `stack build` to build the project, `stack test` to run the tests.

  `stack build --file-watch --haddock` to rebuild documentation as you change it.

  ### Publishing to Hackage

  First, make sure to update the version of package in package.yaml, if needed.

  Then, `stack sdist` to build publishable .tar.gz., and then we need to upload it manually to Hackage.

  Check if Hackage correctly built the Haddock docs -> if not, you need to upload them manually (check Hackage webpage for instructions, it should be smth like `cabal v2-haddock --haddock-for-hackage --enable-doc` and then `cabal upload -d --publish <path_to_docs.tar.gz>`).

  We should also tag the commit in git with version tag (e.g. v1.0.0.0) so we know which version of code was used to produce that release.
