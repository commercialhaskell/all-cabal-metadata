description: |-
  The STM32-Zombie library turns a STM32F103 board into a
  powerful Haskell hackable IO adapter.
  Features are GPIO pins, serial ports, SPI ports, DMA ADC, timers,..
  The library is modeled after the STMicroelectronics
  STM32F10x Firmware Library but does not rely on any c-code or
  cross-compilation
  STM32-Zombie has a low-level interface, which
  allows one to control many details of the micro controller hardware
  and can also be used to build higher level abstraction.
  See the "App.Blink" module
  and the [github page](https://github.com/MarcFontaine/stm32hs)
