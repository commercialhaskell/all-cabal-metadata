description: |-
  A collection of type-classes generalizing the
  read\/write\/modify operations for stateful variables
  provided by things like IORef, TVar, &c.
  Note that The interface has changed a bit from the
  0.2.* version.  \"*Ref\" functions are now called
  \"*Reference\" and new \"*Ref\" function exist with
  simpler signatures.
  The new 'Ref' existential type provides a convenient
  monad-indexed reference type, and the HasRef class
  indicates monads for which there is a default
  reference type for every referent.
