  # string-conv-tests


  ## Synopsis

  Property tests for the Haskell string-conv library


  ## Description

  These are in a separate project not only to keep dependencies low when the
  string-conv library is included in a project but also because these property
  tests use `quickcheck-instances` which defines many orphan instances. Never a
  good idea to force instances like this on other projects.

  This project expects the source code of the string-conv project to be in a
  sibling directory.


  ## Development

  To run these tests

      $ stack test string-conv-tests
