description: ! "# Stutter\n\nStutter is a string utterer.\n\n> utterer: someone who
  expresses in language; someone who talks (especially\n> someone who delivers a public
  speech or someone especially garrulous)\n> (www.vocabulary.com)\n\nStutter takes
  a string definition and crafts as many different strings as it\ncan. See the [examples](#examples)
  section below for inspiration.\n\n# Building\n\nYou need the Haskell build tool\n[stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).
  Just run:\n\n``` shell\n$ stack build\n```\n\n# Installing\n\n\nYou currently need
  the Haskell build tool\n[stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).
  Just run:\n\n``` shell\n$ stack install\n```\n\n# Contributing\n\nThere are several
  ways you can contribute:\n\n* Complain: Just [open an issue](https://github.com/nmattia/stutter/issues/new)\n
  \ and let me know what could be improved.\n* Share a use-case: You found a cool
  case? Great! [open an\n  issue](https://github.com/nmattia/stutter/issues/new) or
  (even better) a PR\n  with your issue added to the [examples](#examples) below.\n*
  Support: Share `stutter` with your friends, you never know who might need it.\n*
  Implement: All PRs are welcome.\n\n# Examples\n\nStutter can be used as a very simple
  `echo` clone:\n\n``` shell\n$ stutter 'Hello, World!'\nHello, World!\n```\n\nBut
  stutter also knows how to enumerate:\n\n\n``` shell\n$ stutter 'foo|bar|baz'\nfoo\nbar\nbaz\n```\n\nYou
  can easily specify which parts you want to enumerate, and which parts\nshould always
  be there:\n\n``` shell\n$ stutter 'My name is (what\\?|who\\?|Slim Shady)'\nMy name
  is what?\nMy name is who?\nMy name is Slim Shady\n```\n\nStutter can also enumerate
  file contents:\n\n\n``` shell\n$ stutter 'foo|bar|baz' > test.txt\n$ stutter '(@test.txt)
  -- stutter was here'\nfoo -- stutter was here\nbar -- stutter was here\nbaz -- stutter
  was here\n```\n\nAnd read from `stdin`:\n\n``` shell\n$ cat test.txt | stutter 'Check
  this out, paste: @-'\nCheck this out, paste: foo\nCheck this out, paste: bar\nCheck
  this out, paste: baz\n```\n\nStutter also likes ranges:\n\n``` shell\n$ stutter
  '[0-9a-f]'\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\na\nb\nc\nd\ne\nf\n```\n\nOf course, it
  can all be used together:\n``` shell\n$ stutter 'My name is (@test.txt) [a-c] (who\\?|what\\?|Slim
  Shady)'\nMy name is foo a who?\nMy name is foo a what?\nMy name is foo a Slim Shady\nMy
  name is foo b who?\nMy name is foo b what?\n...\nMy name is baz c who?\nMy name
  is baz c what?\nMy name is baz c Slim Shady\n```\n\nStutter can teach you binary:\n\n```
  shell\n$ stutter '(0b(0|1){#|5})|I know binary!'\n0b00000\n0b00001\n0b00010\n0b00011\n0b00100\n0b00101\n...\n0b11010\n0b11011\n0b11100\n0b11101\n0b11110\n0b11111\nI
  know binary!\n```\n\nStutter can repeat a char:\n\n``` shell\n$ stutter 'a{42}'\na\na\na\n...\n$
  stutter 'a{42}' | wc -l\n42\n```\n"
