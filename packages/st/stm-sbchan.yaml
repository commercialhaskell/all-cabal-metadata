description: |-
  This library provides a bounded first-in first-out channel type for use in
  STM.  It supports a limit on the /total size/ of items in the channel.

  stm-sbchan also provides a few features not found in other bounded channel
  libraries, such as:

  * Alternative overflow strategies @cramSBChan@ and @rollSBChan@.
  @cramSBChan@ ignores the channel's size limit, and @rollSBChan@
  removes old items from the beginning of the channel when it fills up.

  * The channel limit can be adjusted at runtime.
