  # starter-snake-haskell - A Haskell Battlesnake starter

  This repository contains a Haskell [Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com) starter project.
  It implements `v1` of the Battlesnake API and can be deployed to Heroku.

  # Usage

  This starter repo can be used in two different ways

  1. Installed as a hackage library in your haskell project
  1. As a fork that is subsequently modified to your needs

  # Deployment

  To deploy on Heroku you can use the provided `Procfile` when using the template
  as a fork. Otherwise you will need to define your own `Procfile`.
  Addtionally the
  [heroku-buildpack-stack](https://github.com/mfine/heroku-buildpack-stack)
