  # starter-snake-haskell - A Haskell Battlesnake starter

  This repository contains a Haskell [Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com) starter project.
  It implements `v1` of the Battlesnake API and can be deployed to Heroku.

  # Usage

  This starter repo can be used in two different ways

  1. As a fork that is subsequently modified to your needs
  1. Installed as a hackage library in your haskell project

  ## As a fork

  First clone this repo or create a fork by pushing the fork button and clone your
  fork.

  You can then start implementing your game logic in `app/Main.hs`.

  This template uses [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/) to build
  and run the project.

  To start the server locally run `stack run` which will start a development
  webserver on port 3000. (The port can be changed by setting the `PORT`
  environment variable)

  ## As hackage dependency

  ### With cabal

  Add the dependency to `your-app.cabal`

  ```
  executable myfirstapp
      main-is: Main.hs
      build-depends:
          ...
          starter-snake-haskell ^>=1.1.0
  ```

  ### With stack

  Add the dependency as `extra-dep` in your `stack.yaml`

  ```
  resolver: lts-20.26
  packages:
    - .

  extra-deps:
  - starter-snake-haskell-1.1.0
  ```

  ### Implementation

  You can now start implementing your battlesnake logic in your project. You can
  use the [Main](app/Main.hs) from this repo as a starting point.

  # Deploy to Heroku

  When using the repo as a fork you can use the provided [`Procfile`](Procfile) to
  deploy it to heroku. Otherwise you will need to provide your own.

  Afterwards you can use the [Heroku
  CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#install-the-heroku-cli) to
  deploy your project.

  First, login to your account:

  ```
  heroku login -i
  ```

  Afterwards you can create a new deployment in heroku using the [heroku-buildpack-stack](https://github.com/mfine/heroku-buildpack-stack).

  ```
  heroku create your-battlesnake-name --buildpack https://github.com/mfine/heroku-buildpack-stack
  ```

  You can then push your code to heroku with git where it will be build and deployed:

  ```
  git push heroku master
  ```
