  # Simple, Fair and Terminating Backtracking Monad Transformer

  This Haskell library provides an implementation of the MonadPlus type
  class that enumerates results of a non-deterministic computation by
  interleaving subcomputations in a way that has usually much better
  memory performance than other strategies with the same termination
  properties.

  It also terminates in many cases where the fair conjunction and
  interleaving operators provided by LogicT fail to do so, allowing it
  to safely provide fairness by default.

  More information is available on the [author's website][FBackTrackT].

  This package aims to be a drop-in replacement for the unmaintained
  `stream-monad` package, in addition to providing much of the same
  functionality as the `logict` package.
