  # stack-clean-old

  A small tool to clean away older Haskell [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org)
  snapshot builds and ghc versions to recover diskspace.

  ## Usage
  `stack-clean-old [size|list|remove|keep-minor|purge-older|delete-work] [-d|--delete] [(-p|--project) | (-g|--ghc)] [GHCVER]
  `

  Options:

  - `--project` (default in a stack project dir): act on `.stack-work/install/`
  - `--global` (default outside a project dir): act on `~/.stack/snapshots/` and `~/.stack/programs/`

  and the subcommands:

  `size`:
      prints the total size of the above directories
      (`size` does not take a GHCVER argument).

  `list`:
      shows the total size and number of snapshots per ghc version
      (the GHCVER argument is optional).

  `remove`:
      removes for the specified ghc version (the GHCVER argument is required).

  `keep-minor`:
      removes the builds/installs for older minor releases of ghc major versions.
      If GHCVER is given then only minor versions older than it are removed.

  `purge-older` and `delete-work`:
      see sections below

  If you remove any needed snapshot builds for a version of ghc,
  then you would have to rebuild them again for any projects still using them,
  so removal should be used cautiously, but it can recover a lot of diskspace.

  Since version 0.4 dry-run mode is now the default and one needs to use
  `--delete` (`-d`) for actual deletion of files,
  after checking the dry-run output first.

  ### Example usage
  List a project's builds:
  ```ShellSession
  $ stack-clean-old list
  154M  8.2.2  (5 dirs)
  154M  8.4.4  (5 dirs)
  163M  8.6.5  (5 dirs)
  ```
  Remove project's 8.2.2 builds:
  ```ShellSession
  $ stack-clean-old remove --delete --project 8.2.2
  :
  ```
  (--project is optional in a project dir).

  Remove stack ghc-8.4 snapshot builds and compilers before 8.4.4:
  ```ShellSession
  $ stack-clean-old list --global 8.4
  421M  8.4.1  (7 dirs)
  368M  8.4.2  (6 dirs)
  489M  8.4.3  (8 dirs)
  799M  8.4.4  (24 dirs)
  $ stack-clean-old keep-minor -d -g 8.4.4
  ghc-tinfo6-8.4.3 removed
  7 dirs removed for 8.4.1
  6 dirs removed for 8.4.2
  8 dirs removed for 8.4.3
  ```
  (--global is optional outside a project dir).

  ### Purging older stack project builds
  ```
  stack-clean-old purge-older
  ```
  This command removes older stack builds from `.stack-work/install/`.
  By default it keeps 5 newest builds per ghc version.

  The preservation/deletion is calculated and done per ghc version.

  NB: If you regularly build your project for several branches/tags against the same LTS or ghc version then it is safer to avoid using `purge-older`.

  ### Deleting all `.stack-work/` subdirectories
  `stack-clean-old delete-work --recursive` can be used to remove recursively
  _all_ `.stack-work/` dirs from a project to save space
  (seems same as `stack clean --full`).

  `stack-clean-old delete-work --all` works from outside stack projects:
  please use with care with `--delete`.

  ### Help output
  (Note you can also run this tool via `stack clean-old`.)

  To get help you can run `stack-clean-old --help` or just:
  ```ShellSession
  $ Stack clean up tool

  Usage: stack-clean-old [--version] COMMAND
    Cleans away old stack-work builds (and pending: stack snapshots) to recover
    diskspace. Use the --delete option to perform actual removals.
    https://github.com/juhp/stack-clean-old#readme

  Available options:
    -h,--help                Show this help text
    --version                Show version

  Available commands:
    size                     Total size
    list                     List sizes per ghc version
    remove                   Remove for a ghc version
    keep-minor               Remove for previous ghc minor versions
    purge-older              Purge older builds in .stack-work/install
    delete-work              Remove project's .stack-work/ (optionally
                             recursively)
  ```

  ## Installation

  Run `stack install` or `cabal install`

  ## Related
  This tool complements [stack-all](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stack-all)
  which builds projects across LTS major versions and
  hence generates a lot of stack builds.

  [cabal-clean](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-clean) is
  a similar tool for cleaning old cached cabal build files.
