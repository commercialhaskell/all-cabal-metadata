  # stack-clean-old

  A small tool to clean away older Haskell [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org)
  snapshot builds and ghc versions to recover diskspace.

  ## Usage
  `stack-clean-old [size|list|remove|keep-minor|purge-older|delete-work] [(-P|--project)|(-G|--global)|(-C|--compilers)|(-T|--tarballs)] [(-s|--subdirs)|(-r|--recursive)] [-d|--delete] [GHCVER]`

  In a project directory it acts on `.stack-work/install/` by default,
  otherwise on `${STACK_ROOT}/{snapshots,programs}/`
  (the default *Stack root* is `~/.stack/`):
  see the [Stack root documentation](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/stack_root/).

  Subcommands:

  `size`:
      prints the total size of `.stack-work/` of project(s) or the *Stack root*.
      directories (`size` does not take a GHCVER argument).

  `list`:
      shows the total size and number of snapshots per ghc version
      (the GHCVER argument is optional).

  `remove`:
      removes for the specified ghc version (the GHCVER argument is required).

  `keep-minor`:
      removes the builds/installs for older minor releases of ghc major versions.
      If GHCVER is given then only minor versions older than it
      (or than the latest installed minor version) are removed.
      If no GHCVER is given it applies to each installed ghc major version.

  `purge-older`:
      removes snapshot builds with older timestamps

  `delete-work`:
      removes `.stack-work` directories completely

  Since version 0.4 dry-run mode is now the default and one needs to use
  `--delete` (`-d`) for actual deletion of files,
  after checking the dry-run output first.

  If you should remove any needed snapshot builds,
  then they will get rebuilt again by stack next time you build any projects
  using them, so removals should be done carefully
  but can recover a lot of diskspace.

  Further the commands can use `--subdirs` or `--recursive` to run over
  the projects in subdirs under the current directory or
  all matching `.stack-work` dirs from the current directory and below
  respectively.

  If you have different ghc variants/archs installed
  you can use `--platform` to restrict to one of then,
  otherwise they are each listed by default.

  ### Example usage
  List a project's builds:
  ```ShellSession
  $ stack-clean-old list
  154M  9.2.8  (5 dirs)
  154M  9.4.5  (5 dirs)
  163M  9.6.2  (5 dirs)
  ```
  Remove project's 9.0.2 builds:
  ```ShellSession
  $ stack-clean-old remove --delete --project 9.0.2
  :
  ```
  (--project is optional in a project dir).

  Remove stack ghc-9.4 snapshot builds and minor compilers before 9.4.4:
  ```ShellSession
  $ stack-clean-old list --global 9.4
  421M  9.4.1  (7 dirs)
  368M  9.4.2  (6 dirs)
  489M  9.4.3  (8 dirs)
  799M  9.4.4  (24 dirs)
  $ stack-clean-old keep-minor -d -g 9.4.4
  ghc-tinfo6-9.4.3 removed
  7 dirs removed for 9.4.1
  6 dirs removed for 9.4.2
  8 dirs removed for 9.4.3
  ```
  (--global is optional outside a project dir).

  ### Purging older stack project builds
  ```
  stack-clean-old purge-older
  ```
  This command removes older stack builds from `.stack-work/install/`.
  By default it keeps 5 newest builds per ghc version.

  The preservation/deletion is calculated and done per ghc version.

  NB: If you regularly build your project for several branches/tags against the same LTS or ghc version then it is safer to avoid using `purge-older`.

  ### Deleting all `.stack-work/` subdirectories
  `stack-clean-old delete-work --recursive` can be used to remove recursively
  _all_ `.stack-work/` dirs within (or outside) a project directory to save
  space (seems same as `stack clean --full` inside a project).

  ## Help output
  (Note you can also run this tool via `stack clean-old`.)

  To get help you can run `stack-clean-old --help` or just:
  ```ShellSession
  $ stack-clean-old --version
  0.4.8
  $ stack-clean-old
  Stack clean up tool

  Usage: stack-clean-old [--version] COMMAND

    Cleans away old stack-work builds (and pending: stack snapshots) to recover
    diskspace. Use the --delete option to perform actual removals.
    https://github.com/juhp/stack-clean-old#readme

  Available options:
    -h,--help                Show this help text
    --version                Show version

  Available commands:
    size                     Total size
    list                     List sizes per ghc version
    remove                   Remove for a ghc version
    keep-minor               Remove for previous ghc minor versions
    purge-older              Purge older builds in .stack-work/install
    delete-work              Remove project's .stack-work/ (optionally
                             recursively)
  ```

  ### Command options
  Most of the commands have similar options, e.g.:

  ```shellsession
  $ stack-clean-old remove --help
  Usage: stack-clean-old remove [-d|--delete]
                                [(-P|--project) | (-S|--snapshots) |
                                  (-C|--compilers) | (-T|--tarballs) |
                                  (-G|--global)]
                                [(-s|--subdirs) | (-r|--recursive)] GHCVER
                                [-o|--platform SYSTEM]

    Remove for a ghc version

  Available options:
    -d,--delete              Do deletion [default is dryrun]
    -P,--project             Act on current project's .stack-work/ [default in
                             project dir]
    -S,--snapshots           Act on ~/.stack/snapshots/
    -C,--compilers           Act on ~/.stack/programs/ installations
    -T,--tarballs            Act on ~/.stack/programs/ tarballs
    -G,--global              Act on both ~/.stack/{programs,snapshots}/ [default
                             outside project dir]
    -s,--subdirs             List subdirectories
    -r,--recursive           List subdirectories
    -o,--platform SYSTEM     Specify which OS platform to work on (eg
                             'x86_64-linux-tinfo6', 'aarch64-linux-nix',
                             'x86_64-osx', 'aarch64-osx', etc)
    -h,--help                Show this help text
  ```

  (The `list` and `size` commands don't have `--delete`.)

  ## Installation

  Run `stack install` or `cabal install`

  ## Related
  This tool complements
  [stack-all](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stack-all)
  which builds projects across LTS major versions and
  hence generates a lot of stack builds.

  [cabal-clean](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-clean) is
  a similar tool for cleaning old cached cabal build files.
