  # stack-clean-old

  A small tool to clean away older Haskell [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org)
  snapshot builds and ghc versions to recover diskspace.

  ## Usage
  ```
  stack-clean-old [size|list|remove|keep-minor|purge-older|delete-work] [(-p|--project) | (-g|--ghc)] [GHCVER]
  ```
  Options:

  - `--project` (default in a stack project dir): act on `.stack-work/install/`
  - `--global` (default outside a project dir): act on `~/.stack/snapshots/` and `~/.stack/programs/`

  and the subcommands:

  `size`:
      prints the total size of the above directories
      (`size` does not take a GHCVER argument).

  `list`:
      shows the total size and number of snapshots per ghc version
      (the GHCVER argument is optional).

  `remove`:
      removes for the specified ghc version (the GHCVER argument is required).

  `keep-minor`:
      removes the builds/installs for previous minor ghc versions.
      If GHCVER is given then only minor versions older than it are removed.

  `purge-older` and `delete-work`:
      see sections below

  If you remove any needed snapshot builds for a version of ghc,
  then you would have to rebuild them again for any projects still using them,
  so removal should be used cautiously, but it can recover a lot of diskspace.

  NBB: All the command support `--dry-run` (`-n`), so please use it to
  check the effect of running them safely beforehand.

  ### Example usage
  To remove project builds for ghc-8.2.2:
  ```
  $ stack-clean-old list
  154M  8.2.2  (5 dirs)
  154M  8.4.4  (5 dirs)
  163M  8.6.5  (5 dirs)
  $ stack-clean-old remove -p 8.2.2
  ```

  Remove stack ghc-8.4 snapshot builds and compilers before 8.4.4:
  ```
  $ stack-clean-old list -g 8.4
  421M  8.4.1  (7 dirs)
  368M  8.4.2  (6 dirs)
  489M  8.4.3  (8 dirs)
  799M  8.4.4  (24 dirs)
  $ stack-clean-old keep-minor -g 8.4.4
  ghc-tinfo6-8.4.3 removed
  7 dirs removed for 8.4.1
  6 dirs removed for 8.4.2
  8 dirs removed for 8.4.3
  ```

  Incidently I build my projects across as many major Stackage LTS versions as possible (using my stack-all tool), and collectively this piles up to a lot of diskspace: so I wrote this tool to help manage that.

  ### Purging older stack project builds
  ```
  stack-clean-old purge-older
  ```
  This command removes older stack builds from `.stack-work/install/`.
  By default it keeps 5 newest builds per ghc version.

  The preservation/deletion is calculated and done per ghc version.

  NB: If you regularly build your project for several branches/tags against the same LTS or ghc version then it is safer to avoid using `purge-older`.

  ### Deleting all `.stack-work/` subdirectories
  `stack-clean-old delete-work` can be used to recursively remove
  _all_ `.stack-work/` dirs from a project to save space
  (seems same as `stack clean --full`).

  `stack-clean-old delete-work --all` works from outside stack projects:
  please test with `--dry-run` first.

  ## Installation

  Run `stack install` or `cabal install`

  ## Related
  This tool complements [stack-all](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stack-all)
  which builds projects over LTS major versions and hence generates lot of stack builds.
