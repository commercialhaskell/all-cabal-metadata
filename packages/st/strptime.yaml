description: |-
  This library provides a binding to strptime, that allows to parse
  dates and times from strings and strict/lazy bytestrings. The library
  creates LocalTime values. It provides some extra features which
  the original strptime lacks - parsing of fractional seconds and parsing
  of ten-powers of seconds since epoch (for example milliseconds since epoch).
