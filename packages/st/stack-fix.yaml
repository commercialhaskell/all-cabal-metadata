  # Haskell Stack Fix

  Console program used to fix Stack build errors automatically

  ## How it works

  Stack fix works by running `stack build` and by parsing and interpreting the build errors/suggestions it applies any build fixes required to the stack.yaml, .cabal, etc. These fixes usually involve specifying build dependencies versions or adding new build dependencies.

  To use stack-fix:

  * run `stack-fix` in the root of your stack project
  * enjoy not having to waste countless hours on fixing build issues which can be fixed automatically by `stack-fix`

  ## Contributing

  To contribute:

  * Fork the project
  * Pick any ticket you wish to work on from the project roadmap kanban board that is in the To Do column
  * Assign the ticket to yourself and if it makes sense leave a comment detailing at high level what approach you will take
  * Implement the feature
  * Submit a pull request

  ### Setting up operating system

  #### Windows

  We do not support building the project on Windows since many Haskell packages have issues building on Windows.

  If you are a Windows user the recommended method is to use WSL or a Linux VMWare virtual machine for your development. The virtual machine option is preffered over WSL since WSL is currently much slower when building stuff than a virtual machine.

  #### Linux or MacOS

  The project should build fine on these operating systems.

  ### Setting up build tools

  The recommended way to install `cabal-install` is by using the `Nix` package manager.

  To install Nix run:

  ```shell
      curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
  ```

  To install `GHC`, `cabal-install` and `stack`,  create the file `~/.nixpkgs/config.nix`.

  Copy paste this into the file:

  ```nix
  let
    config = {
      allowUnfree = true;

      packageOverrides = pkgs: with pkgs;
        let jdk = openjdk11; in rec {
        unstable = import <nixpkgs> { inherit config; };

        all = pkgs.buildEnv {
          name = "all";

          paths = [
            haskell.compiler.ghc864
            haskellPackages.cabal-install
            unstable.haskellPackages.stack
            binutils.bintools # required on WSL
          ];
        };
      };
    };
  in config
  ```

  And run following command to install the packages:

  ```shell
  nix-env -i all
  ```

  Run this to update the cabal pacakges:

  ```shell
  cabal v1-update
  ```

  ### Setting up your development tools

  The recommended editors are Atom and VSCode together with the Haskell IDE Enginer extension.

  To install the HIE executable required by the editor extensions via `~/.nixpkgs/config.nix` make changes reflected in the following:

  ```nix
  let
    all-hies = import (fetchTarball "https://github.com/infinisil/all-hies/tarball/master") {};
    config = {
      allowUnfree = true;

      packageOverrides = pkgs: with pkgs;
        let jdk = openjdk11; in rec {
        unstable = import <nixpkgs> { inherit config; };

        all = pkgs.buildEnv {
          name = "all";

          paths = [
            haskell.compiler.ghc864
            haskellPackages.cabal-install
            unstable.haskellPackages.stack
            binutils.bintools # required on WSL
            (all-hies.selection { selector = p: { inherit (p) ghc864; }; })
          ];
        };
      };
    };
  in config
  ```

  Then install the HIE extension inside Atom or VSCode.

  ### Building the project

  * open a shell window in the `haskell-stack-fix` project root.
  * run `cabal v1-install --dependencies-only`
  * run the command `cabal v1-build`
