description: |
  This library provides a Software Transactional Memory (STM) monad with commit and retry IO hooks. A retry-action is run (at least once) if the transaction retries, while comm it-actions are executed iff the transaction commits. The AdvSTM monad also gives some atomicity guarantees for commit-actions:

  * When a TVar is modified in a transaction and this transaction commits,
  the update remains invisible to other threads until the corresponding
  onCommit action is run.

  * If the onCommit action throws an exception, the original values of
  the modified TVars are restored.

  Note: The package can be used as a drop-in replacement for
  'Control.Concurrent.STM'.
