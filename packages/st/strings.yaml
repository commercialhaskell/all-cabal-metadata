description: |-
  This package provides various functions for working with strings,
  such as @join@, @split@, @toUppercase@, etc.

  The functions in this package work with all kinds of strings
  such as Text, ByteString, String, and their respective lazy counter
  parts. There is also an interface which is agnostic of the underlying
  string type.

  [@v1.0.2@] Fixed an issue with @strSplitAll@. Applied to the empty string
  it should return an empty list, but it returned a list containing
  a single empty string. It now returns correctly the empty list.

  [@v1.1@] Added @strToUpper@, @strToLower@, @strCapitalize@, @strCons@,
  and  @strMap@. Also @sCapitalize@, @sCons@, and @sMap@.
