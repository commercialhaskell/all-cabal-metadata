description: |-
  This package provides head normal form strict versions of some
  standard Haskell concurrency abstractions (MVars,Chans), which
  provide control over where evaluation takes place not offered by
  the default lazy types. This may be useful for deciding when and
  where evaluation occurs, leading to improved time or space use,
  depending on the circumstances.
