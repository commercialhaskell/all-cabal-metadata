  # Changelog

  <!-- See rendered changelog at https://streamly.composewell.com -->

  ## 0.8.0

  See [API Changelog](docs/API-changelog.txt) for a complete list of signature
  changes and new APIs introduced.

  ### Breaking changes

  * `Streamly.Prelude`
      * `fold`: this function may now terminate early without consuming
        the entire stream. For example, `fold Fold.head stream` would
        now terminate immediately after consuming the head element from
        `stream`. This may result in change of behavior in existing programs
        if the program relies on the evaluation of the full stream.
  * `Streamly.Data.Unicode.Stream`
      * The following APIs no longer throw errors on invalid input, use new
        APIs suffixed with a prime for strict behavior:
          * decodeUtf8
          * encodeLatin1
          * encodeUtf8
  * `Streamly.Data.Fold`:
      * Several instances have been moved to the `Streamly.Data.Fold.Tee`
        module, please use the `Tee` type to adapt to the changes.

  ### Bug Fixes

  * Concurrent Streams: The monadic state for the stream is now propagated across
    threads. Please refer to
    [#369](https://github.com/composewell/streamly/issues/369) for more info.
  * `Streamly.Prelude`:
      * `bracket`, `handle`, and `finally` now also work correctly on streams
        that aren't fully drained. Also, the resource acquisition and release is
        atomic with respect to async exceptions.
      * `iterate`, `iterateM` now consume O(1) space instead of O(n).
      * `fromFoldableM` is fixed to be concurrent.
  * `Streamly.Network.Inet.TCP`: `accept` and `connect` APIs now close the socket
    if an exception is thrown.
  * `Streamly.Network.Socket`: `accept` now closes the socket if an exception is
    thrown.

  ### Enhancements

  * See [API Changelog](docs/API-changelog.txt) for a complete list of new
    modules and APIs introduced.
  * The Fold type is now more powerful, the new termination behavior allows
    to express basic parsing of streams using folds.
  * Many new Fold and Unfold APIs are added.
  * A new module for console IO APIs is added.
  * Experimental modules for the following are added:
      * Parsing
      * Deserialization
      * File system event handling (fsnotify/inotify)
      * Folds for streams of arrays
  * Experimental `use-c-malloc` build flag to use the c library `malloc` for
    array allocations. This could be useful to avoid pinned memory fragmentation.


  ### Notable Internal/Pre-release API Changes

  Breaking changes:

  * The `Fold` type has changed to accommodate terminating folds.
  * Rename: `Streamly.Internal.Prelude` => `Streamly.Internal.Data.Stream.IsStream`
  * Several other internal modules have been renamed and re-factored.

  Bug fixes:

  * A bug was fixed in the conversion of `MicroSecond64` and `MilliSecond64`
    (commit e5119626)
  * Bug fix: `classifySessionsBy` now flushes sessions at the end and terminates.

  ### Miscellaneous

  * Drop support for GHC 7.10.3.
  * The examples in this package are moved to a new github repo
    [streamly-examples](https://github.com/composewell/streamly-examples)

  ## 0.7.3 (February 2021)

  ### Build Issues

  * Fix build issues with primitive package version >= 0.7.1.
  * Fix build issues on armv7.

  ## 0.7.2 (April 2020)

  ### Bug Fixes

  * Fix a bug in the `Applicative` and `Functor` instances of the `Fold`
    data type.

  ### Build Issues

  * Fix a bug that occasionally caused a build failure on windows when
    used with `stack` or `stack ghci`.
  * Now builds on 32-bit machines.
  * Now builds with `primitive` package version >= 0.5.4 && <= 0.6.4.0
  * Now builds with newer `QuickCheck` package version >= 2.14 && < 2.15.
  * Now builds with GHC 8.10.

  ## 0.7.1 (February 2020)

  ### Bug Fixes

  * Fix a bug that caused `findIndices` to return wrong indices in some
    cases.
  * Fix a bug in `tap`, `chunksOf` that caused memory consumption to
    increase in some cases.
  * Fix a space leak in concurrent streams (`async`, `wAsync`, and `ahead`) that
    caused memory consumption to increase with the number of elements in the
    stream, especially when built with `-threaded` and used with `-N` RTS option.
    The issue occurs only in cases when a worker thread happens to be used
    continuously for a long time.
  * Fix scheduling of WAsyncT stream style to be in round-robin fashion.
  * Now builds with `containers` package version < 0.5.8.
  * Now builds with `network` package version >= 3.0.0.0 && < 3.1.0.0.

  ### Behavior change

  * Combinators in `Streamly.Network.Inet.TCP` no longer use TCP `NoDelay` and
    `ReuseAddr` socket options by default. These options can now be specified
    using appropriate combinators.

  ### Performance

  * Now uses `fusion-plugin` package for predictable stream fusion optimizations
  * Significant improvement in performance of concurrent stream operations.
  * Improved space and time performance of `Foldable` instance.

  ## 0.7.0 (November 2019)

  ### Breaking changes

  * Change the signature of `foldrM` to ensure that it is lazy
  * Change the signature of `iterateM` to ensure that it is lazy.
  * `scanx` would now require an additional `Monad m` constraint.

  ### Behavior change

  * Earlier `ParallelT` was unaffected by `maxBuffer` directive, now `maxBuffer`
    can limit the buffer of a `ParallelT` stream as well. When the buffer becomes
    full, the producer threads block.
  * `ParallelT` streams no longer have an unlimited buffer by default. Now the
    buffer for parallel streams is limited to 1500 by default, the same as other
    concurrent stream types.

  ### Deprecations

  * In `Streamly.Prelude`:
      * `runStream` has been replaced by `drain`
      * `runN` has been replaced by `drainN`
      * `runWhile` has been replaced by `drainWhile`
      * `fromHandle` has been deprecated. Please use
        `Streamly.FileSystem.Handle.read`, `Streamly.Data.Unicode.Stream.decodeUtf8` and
        `splitOnSuffix` with `Streamly.Data.Fold.toList` to split the
         stream to a stream of `String` separated by a newline.
      * `toHandle` has been deprecated. Please use `intersperse` and `concatUnfold` to
        add newlines to a stream, `Streamly.Data.Unicode.Stream.encodeUtf8` for encoding and
        `Streamly.FileSystem.Handle.write` for writing to a file handle.
      * Deprecate `scanx`, `foldx`, `foldxM`, `foldr1`
      * Remove deprecated APIs `foldl`, `foldlM`
      * Replace deprecated API `scan` with a new signature, to scan using Fold.

  * In `Streamly` module:
      * `runStream` has been deprecated, please use `Streamly.Prelude.drain`

  * Remove deprecated module `Streamly.Time` (moved to Streamly.Internal.Data.Time)
  * Remove module `Streamly.Internal` (functionality moved to the Internal hierarchy)

  ### Bug Fixes

  * Fix a bug that caused `uniq` function to yield the same element twice.
  * Fix a bug that caused "thread blocked indefinitely in an MVar operation"
    exception in a parallel stream.
  * Fix unbounded memory usage (leak) in `parallel` combinator. The bug manifests
    when large streams are combined using `parallel`.

  ### Major Enhancements

  This release contains a lot of new features and major enhancements.  For more
  details on the new features described below please see the haddock docs of the
  modules on hackage.

  #### Exception Handling

  See `Streamly.Prelude` for new exception handling combinators like `before`,
  `after`, `bracket`, `onException`, `finally`, `handle` etc.

  #### Composable Folds

  `Streamly.Data.Fold` module provides composable folds (stream consumers). Folds
  allow splitting, grouping, partitioning, unzipping and nesting a stream onto
  multiple folds without breaking the stream. Combinators are provided for
  temporal and spatial window based fold operations, for example, to support
  folding and aggregating data for timeout or inactivity based sessions.

  #### Composable Unfolds

  `Streamly.Data.Unfold` module provides composable stream generators. Unfolds allow
  high performance merging/flattening/combining of stream generators.

  #### Streaming File IO

  `Streamly.FileSystem.Handle` provides handle based streaming file IO
  operations.

  #### Streaming Network IO

  * `Streamly.Network.Socket` provides socket based streaming network IO
  operations.

  * `Streamly.Network.Inet.TCP` provides combinators to build Inet/TCP
  clients and servers.

  #### Concurrent concatMap

  The new `concatMapWith` in `Streamly.Prelude` combinator performs a
  `concatMap` using a supplied merge/concat strategy. This is a very
  powerful combinator as you can, for example, concat streams
  concurrently using this.

  ### Other Enhancements

  * Add the following new features/modules:
    * _Unicode Strings_: `Streamly.Data.Unicode.Stream` module provides
      encoding/decoding of character streams and other character stream
      operations.
    * _Arrays_: `Streamly.Memory.Array` module provides arrays for efficient
      in-memory buffering and efficient interfacing with IO.

  * Add the following to `Streamly.Prelude`:
      * `unfold`, `fold`, `scan` and `postscan`
      * `concatUnfold` to concat a stream after unfolding each element
      * `intervalsOf` and `chunksOf`
      * `splitOn`, `splitOnSuffix`, `splitWithSuffix`, and `wordsBy`
      * `groups`, `groupsBy` and `groupsByRolling`
      * `postscanl'` and `postscanlM'`
      * `intersperse` intersperse an element in between consecutive elements in
        stream
      * `trace` combinator maps a monadic function on a stream just for side
        effects
      * `tap` redirects a copy of the stream to a `Fold`

  ## 0.6.1 (March 2019)

  ### Bug Fixes

  * Fix a bug that caused `maxThreads` directive to be ignored when rate control
    was not used.

  ### Enhancements

  * Add GHCJS support
  * Remove dependency on "clock" package

  ## 0.6.0 (December 2018)

  ### Breaking changes

  * `Monad` constraint may be needed on some of the existing APIs (`findIndices`
    and `elemIndices`).

  ### Enhancements

  * Add the following functions to Streamly.Prelude:
      * Generation: `replicate`, `fromIndices`, `fromIndicesM`
      * Enumeration: `Enumerable` type class, `enumerateFrom`, `enumerateFromTo`,
        `enumerateFromThen`, `enumerateFromThenTo`, `enumerate`, `enumerateTo`
      * Running: `runN`, `runWhile`
      * Folds: `(!!)`, `maximumBy`, `minimumBy`, `the`
      * Scans: `scanl1'`, `scanl1M'
      * Filters: `uniq`, `insertBy`, `deleteBy`, `findM`
      * Multi-stream: `eqBy`, `cmpBy`, `mergeBy`, `mergeByM`, `mergeAsyncBy`,
        `mergeAsyncByM`, `isPrefixOf`, `isSubsequenceOf`, `stripPrefix`,
        `concatMap`, `concatMapM`, `indexed`, `indexedR`
  * Following instances were added for `SerialT m`, `WSerialT m` and
    `ZipSerialM m`:
    * When `m` ~ `Identity`: IsList, Eq, Ord, Show, Read, IsString, NFData,
      NFData1, Traversable
    * When `m` is `Foldable`: Foldable
  * Performance improvements
  * Add benchmarks to measure composed and iterated operations

  ## 0.5.2 (October 2018)

  ### Bug Fixes

  * Cleanup any pending threads when an exception occurs.
  * Fixed a livelock in ahead style streams. The problem manifests sometimes when
    multiple streams are merged together in ahead style and one of them is a nil
    stream.
  * As per expected concurrency semantics each forked concurrent task must run
    with the monadic state captured at the fork point.  This release fixes a bug,
    which, in some cases caused an incorrect monadic state to be used for a
    concurrent action, leading to unexpected behavior when concurrent streams are
    used in a stateful monad e.g. `StateT`. Particularly, this bug cannot affect
    `ReaderT`.

  ## 0.5.1 (September 2018)

  * Performance improvements, especially space consumption, for concurrent
    streams

  ## 0.5.0 (September 2018)

  ### Bug Fixes

  * Leftover threads are now cleaned up as soon as the consumer is garbage
    collected.
  * Fix a bug in concurrent function application that in certain cases would
    unnecessarily share the concurrency state resulting in incorrect output
    stream.
  * Fix passing of state across `parallel`, `async`, `wAsync`, `ahead`, `serial`,
    `wSerial` combinators. Without this fix combinators that rely on state
    passing e.g.  `maxThreads` and `maxBuffer` won't work across these
    combinators.

  ### Enhancements

  * Added rate limiting combinators `rate`, `avgRate`, `minRate`, `maxRate` and
    `constRate` to control the yield rate of a stream.
  * Add `foldl1'`, `foldr1`, `intersperseM`, `find`, `lookup`, `and`, `or`,
    `findIndices`, `findIndex`, `elemIndices`, `elemIndex`, `init` to Prelude

  ### Deprecations

  * The `Streamly.Time` module is now deprecated, its functionality is subsumed
    by the new rate limiting combinators.

  ## 0.4.1 (July 2018)

  ### Bug Fixes

  * foldxM was not fully strict, fixed.

  ## 0.4.0 (July 2018)

  ### Breaking changes

  * Signatures of `zipWithM` and `zipAsyncWithM` have changed
  * Some functions in prelude now require an additional `Monad` constraint on
    the underlying type of the stream.

  ### Deprecations

  * `once` has been deprecated and renamed to `yieldM`

  ### Enhancements

  * Add concurrency control primitives `maxThreads` and `maxBuffer`.
  * Concurrency of a stream with bounded concurrency when used with `take` is now
    limited by the number of elements demanded by `take`.
  * Significant performance improvements utilizing stream fusion optimizations.
  * Add `yield` to construct a singleton stream from a pure value
  * Add `repeat` to generate an infinite stream by repeating a pure value
  * Add `fromList` and `fromListM` to generate streams from lists, faster than
    `fromFoldable` and `fromFoldableM`
  * Add `map` as a synonym of fmap
  * Add `scanlM'`, the monadic version of scanl'
  * Add `takeWhileM` and `dropWhileM`
  * Add `filterM`

  ## 0.3.0 (June 2018)

  ### Breaking changes

  * Some prelude functions, to whom concurrency capability has been added, will
    now require a `MonadAsync` constraint.

  ### Bug Fixes

  * Fixed a race due to which, in a rare case, we might block indefinitely on
    an MVar due to a lost wakeup.
  * Fixed an issue in adaptive concurrency. The issue caused us to stop creating
    more worker threads in some cases due to a race. This bug would not cause any
    functional issue but may reduce concurrency in some cases.

  ### Enhancements
  * Added a concurrent lookahead stream type `Ahead`
  * Added `fromFoldableM` API that creates a stream from a container of monadic
    actions
  * Monadic stream generation functions `consM`, `|:`, `unfoldrM`, `replicateM`,
    `repeatM`, `iterateM` and `fromFoldableM` can now generate streams
    concurrently when used with concurrent stream types.
  * Monad transformation functions `mapM` and `sequence` can now map actions
    concurrently when used at appropriate stream types.
  * Added concurrent function application operators to run stages of a
    stream processing function application pipeline concurrently.
  * Added `mapMaybe` and `mapMaybeM`.

  ## 0.2.1 (June 2018)

  ### Bug Fixes
  * Fixed a bug that caused some transformation ops to return incorrect results
    when used with concurrent streams. The affected ops are `take`, `filter`,
    `takeWhile`, `drop`, `dropWhile`, and `reverse`.

  ## 0.2.0 (May 2018)

  ### Breaking changes
  * Changed the semantics of the Semigroup instance for `InterleavedT`, `AsyncT`
    and `ParallelT`. The new semantics are as follows:
    * For `InterleavedT`, `<>` operation interleaves two streams
    * For `AsyncT`, `<>` now concurrently merges two streams in a left biased
      manner using demand based concurrency.
    * For `ParallelT`, the `<>` operation now concurrently meges the two streams
      in a fairly parallel manner.

    To adapt to the new changes, replace `<>` with `serial` wherever it is used
    for stream types other than `StreamT`.

  * Remove the `Alternative` instance.  To adapt to this change replace any usage
    of `<|>` with `parallel` and `empty` with `nil`.
  * Stream type now defaults to the `SerialT` type unless explicitly specified
    using a type combinator or a monomorphic type.  This change reduces puzzling
    type errors for beginners. It includes the following two changes:
    * Change the type of all stream elimination functions to use `SerialT`
      instead of a polymorphic type. This makes sure that the stream type is
      always fixed at all exits.
    * Change the type combinators (e.g. `parallely`) to only fix the argument
      stream type and the output stream type remains polymorphic.

    Stream types may have to be changed or type combinators may have to be added
    or removed to adapt to this change.
  * Change the type of `foldrM` to make it consistent with `foldrM` in base.
  * `async` is renamed to `mkAsync` and `async` is now a new API with a different
    meaning.
  * `ZipAsync` is renamed to `ZipAsyncM` and `ZipAsync` is now ZipAsyncM
    specialized to the IO Monad.
  * Remove the `MonadError` instance as it was not working correctly for
    parallel compositions. Use `MonadThrow` instead for error propagation.
  * Remove Num/Fractional/Floating instances as they are not very useful. Use
    `fmap` and `liftA2` instead.

  ### Deprecations
  * Deprecate and rename the following symbols:
      * `Streaming` to `IsStream`
      * `runStreaming` to `runStream`
      * `StreamT` to `SerialT`
      * `InterleavedT` to `WSerialT`
      * `ZipStream` to `ZipSerialM`
      * `ZipAsync` to `ZipAsyncM`
      * `interleaving` to `wSerially`
      * `zipping` to `zipSerially`
      * `zippingAsync` to `zipAsyncly`
      * `<=>` to `wSerial`
      * `<|` to `async`
      * `each` to `fromFoldable`
      * `scan` to `scanx`
      * `foldl` to `foldx`
      * `foldlM` to `foldxM`
  * Deprecate the following symbols for future removal:
      * `runStreamT`
      * `runInterleavedT`
      * `runAsyncT`
      * `runParallelT`
      * `runZipStream`
      * `runZipAsync`

  ### Enhancements
  * Add the following functions:
      * `consM` and `|:` operator to construct streams from monadic actions
      * `once` to create a singleton stream from a monadic action
      * `repeatM` to construct a stream by repeating a monadic action
      * `scanl'` strict left scan
      * `foldl'` strict left fold
      * `foldlM'` strict left fold with a monadic fold function
      * `serial` run two streams serially one after the other
      * `async` run two streams asynchronously
      * `parallel` run two streams in parallel (replaces `<|>`)
      * `WAsyncT` stream type for BFS version of `AsyncT` composition
  * Add simpler stream types that are specialized to the IO monad
  * Put a bound (1500) on the output buffer used for asynchronous tasks
  * Put a limit (1500) on the number of threads used for Async and WAsync types

  ## 0.1.2 (March 2018)

  ### Enhancements
  * Add `iterate`, `iterateM` stream operations

  ### Bug Fixes
  * Fixed a bug that caused unexpected behavior when `pure` was used to inject
    values in Applicative composition of `ZipStream` and `ZipAsync` types.

  ## 0.1.1 (March 2018)

  ### Enhancements
  * Make `cons` right associative and provide an operator form `.:` for it
  * Add `null`, `tail`, `reverse`, `replicateM`, `scan` stream operations
  * Improve performance of some stream operations (`foldl`, `dropWhile`)

  ### Bug Fixes
  * Fix the `product` operation. Earlier, it always returned 0 due to a bug
  * Fix the `last` operation, which returned `Nothing` for singleton streams

  Streamly is a Haskell library that provides the building blocks to build
  safe, scalable, modular and high performance software.  Streamly offers:

  * The type safety of Haskell.
  * The performance of C programs.
  * Powerful abstractions for structuring your code.
  * Idiomatic functional programming.
  * Declarative concurrency for the seamless use of multiprocessing hardware.

  ## About This Document

  This guide introduces programming with [Streamly][] using a few practical
  examples:

  *  We will start with a simple program that [counts the number of words
     in a text](#modular-word-counting). We will then transform this program
     into a [concurrent](#concurrent-word-counting) program that can efficiently
     use multiprocessing hardware.
  *  Next, we will create a [concurrent network
     server](#a-concurrent-network-server). We then show
     how to write a network server that [merges multiple
     streams](#merging-incoming-streams) concurrently.
  *  Our third example shows how to list a directory tree concurrently,
     by reading [multiple directories in
     parallel](#listing-directories-recursivelyconcurrently).
  *  Finally, we will look at how to [rate limit](#rate-limiting) stream
     processing.

  The guide then looks at how Streamly achieves its
  [performance](#performance).  It [concludes](#notes) with a brief
  discussion about Streamly's design philosophy, and with suggestions for
  further reading.

  ## Getting Started

  ### Installing Streamly

  If you wish to follow along with this guide, you will need to have
  [Streamly][] installed.

  Please see the [Getting Started With The Streamly Package](docs/getting-started.md)
  guide for instructions on how to install [Streamly][].

  If you wish to run benchmarks, please be sure to build your
  application using the instructions in the [Build Guide](docs/building.md).

  ### An overview of the types used in these examples

  As an expository device, we have indicated the types at the intermediate
  stages of stream computations as comments in the examples below.
  The meaning of these types are:

  * A `SerialT IO a` is a serial stream of values of type `a` in the IO Monad.
  * An `AsyncT IO a` is a concurrent (asynchronous) stream of values of type
    `a` in the IO Monad.
  * An `Unfold IO a b` is a representation of a function that converts a seed
    value of type `a` into a stream of values of type `b` in the IO Monad.
  * A `Fold IO a b` is a representation of a function that converts a stream of
    type `a` to a final accumulator of type `b` in the IO Monad.

  ### A Note on Module Naming

  Some of the examples below use modules from the `Internal` Streamly package
  hierarchy.  These are not really internal to the library.  We classify
  `Streamly` modules into two categories:

  * _Released modules and APIs_: These modules and APIs are
    stable. Significant changes to these modules and APIs will cause
    Streamly's version number to change according to the package versioning
    policy.
  * _Pre-release modules and APIs_: These modules and APIs have not been
    formally released yet.  They may change in the near future, and such
    changes will not necessarily be reflected in Streamly's package
    version number.  As yet unreleased modules and APIs reside in the
    `Internal` namespace.

  ## The Examples

  ### Modular Word Counting

  A `Fold` in Streamly is a composable stream consumer.  For our first
  example, we will use `Fold`s to count the number of bytes, words and lines
  present in a file.  We will then compose individual `Fold`s together to
  count words, bytes and lines at the same time.

  Please see the file [WordCountModular.hs][] for the complete example
  program, including the imports that we have omitted here.

  #### Count Bytes (wc -c)

  We start with a code fragment that counts the number of bytes in a file:

  ```haskell
  import qualified Streamly.Data.Fold as Fold
  import qualified Streamly.Internal.FileSystem.File as File
  import qualified Streamly.Prelude as Stream

  wcb :: String -> IO Int
  wcb file =
      File.toBytes file        -- SerialT IO Word8
    & Stream.fold Fold.length  -- IO Int
  ```

  ### Count Lines (wc -l)

  The next code fragment shows how to count the number of lines in a file:

  ```haskell
  -- ASCII character 10 is a newline.
  countl :: Int -> Word8 -> Int
  countl n ch = if ch == 10 then n + 1 else n

  -- The fold accepts a stream of `Word8` and returns a line count (`Int`).
  nlines :: Monad m => Fold m Word8 Int
  nlines = Fold.foldl' countl 0

  wcl :: String -> IO Int
  wcl file =
      File.toBytes file  -- SerialT IO Word8
    & Stream.fold nlines -- IO Int
  ```

  ### Count Words (wc -w)

  Our final code fragment counts the number of whitespace-separated words
  in a stream:

  ```haskell
  countw :: (Int, Bool) -> Word8 -> (Int, Bool)
  countw (n, wasSpace) ch =
      if isSpace $ chr $ fromIntegral ch
      then (n, True)
      else (if wasSpace then n + 1 else n, False)

  -- The fold accepts a stream of `Word8` and returns a word count (`Int`).
  nwords :: Monad m => Fold m Word8 Int
  nwords = fst <$> Fold.foldl' countw (0, True)

  wcw :: String -> IO Int
  wcw file =
      File.toBytes file   -- SerialT IO Word8
    & Stream.fold nwords  -- IO Int
  ```

  ### Counting Bytes, Words and Lines Together

  By using the `Tee` combinator we can compose the three folds that count
  bytes, lines and words individually into a single fold that counts all
  three at once.  The applicative instance of `Tee` distributes its input
  to all the supplied folds (`Fold.length`, `nlines`, and `nwords`) and
  then combines the outputs from the folds using the supplied combiner
  function (`(,,)`).

  ```haskell
  import qualified Streamly.Internal.Data.Fold.Tee as Tee

  -- The fold accepts a stream of `Word8` and returns the three counts.
  countAll :: Fold IO Word8 (Int, Int, Int)
  countAll = Tee.toFold $ (,,) <$> Tee Fold.length <*> Tee nlines <*> Tee nwords

  wc :: String -> IO (Int, Int, Int)
  wc file =
      File.toBytes file    -- SerialT IO Word8
    & Stream.fold countAll -- IO (Int, Int, Int)
  ```

  This example demonstrates the excellent modularity offered by
  [Streamly][]'s simple and concise API.  Experienced Haskellers will
  notice that we have not used bytestrings&mdash;we instead used a stream of
  `Word8` values, simplifying our program.

  ### The Performance of Word Counting

  We compare two equivalent implementations: one using [Streamly][],
  and the other using C.

  The performance of the [Streamly word counting
  implementation][WordCount.hs] is:

  ```
  $ time WordCount-hs gutenberg-500MB.txt
  11242220 97050938 574714449 gutenberg-500MB.txt

  real    0m1.825s
  user    0m1.697s
  sys     0m0.128s
  ```

  The performance of an equivalent [wc implementation in C][WordCount.c] is:

  ```
  $ time WordCount-c gutenberg-500MB.txt
  11242220 97050938 574714449 gutenberg-500MB.txt

  real    0m2.100s
  user    0m1.935s
  sys     0m0.165s
  ```

  ### Concurrent Word Counting

  In our next example we show how the task of counting words, lines,
  and bytes could be done in parallel on multiprocessor hardware.

  To count words in parallel we first divide the stream into chunks
  (arrays), do the counting within each chunk, and then add all the
  counts across chunks.  We use the same code as above except that we use
  arrays for our input data.

  Please see the file [WordCountParallel.hs][] for the complete working
  code for this example, including the imports that we have omitted below.

  The `countArray` function counts the line, word, char counts in one chunk:

  ```haskell
  import qualified Streamly.Data.Array.Foreign as Array

  countArray :: Array Word8 -> IO Counts
  countArray arr =
        Stream.unfold Array.read arr            -- SerialT IO Word8
      & Stream.decodeLatin1                     -- SerialT IO Char
      & Stream.foldl' count (Counts 0 0 0 True) -- IO Counts
  ```

  Here the function `count` and the `Counts` data type are defined in the
  `WordCount` helper module defined in [WordCount.hs][].

  When combining the counts in two contiguous chunks, we need to check
  whether the first element of the next chunk is a whitespace character
  in order to determine if the same word continues in the next chunk or
  whether the chunk starts with a new word. The `partialCounts` function
  adds a `Bool` flag to `Counts` returned by `countArray` to indicate
  whether the first character in the chunk is a space.

  ```haskell
  partialCounts :: Array Word8 -> IO (Bool, Counts)
  partialCounts arr = do
      let r = Array.getIndex arr 0
      case r of
          Just x -> do
              counts <- countArray arr
              return (isSpace (chr (fromIntegral x)), counts)
          Nothing -> return (False, Counts 0 0 0 True)
  ```

  `addCounts` then adds the counts from two consecutive chunks:

  ```haskell
  addCounts :: (Bool, Counts) -> (Bool, Counts) -> (Bool, Counts)
  addCounts (sp1, Counts l1 w1 c1 ws1) (sp2, Counts l2 w2 c2 ws2) =
      let wcount =
              if not ws1 && not sp2 -- No space between two chunks.
              then w1 + w2 - 1
              else w1 + w2
       in (sp1, Counts (l1 + l2) wcount (c1 + c2) ws2)
  ```

  To count in parallel we now only need to divide the stream into arrays,
  apply our counting function to each array, and then combine the counts
  from each chunk.

  ```haskell
  wc :: String -> IO (Bool, Counts)
  wc file = do
        Stream.unfold File.readChunks file -- AheadT IO (Array Word8)
      & Stream.mapM partialCounts          -- AheadT IO (Bool, Counts)
      & Stream.maxThreads numCapabilities  -- AheadT IO (Bool, Counts)
      & Stream.fromAhead                   -- SerialT IO (Bool, Counts)
      & Stream.foldl' addCounts (False, Counts 0 0 0 True) -- IO (Bool, Counts)
  ```

  Please note that the only difference between a concurrent and a
  non-concurrent program lies in the use of the `Stream.fromAhead`
  combinator.  If we remove the call to `Stream.fromAhead`, we would
  still have a perfectly valid and performant serial program. Notice
  how succinctly and idiomatically we have expressed the concurrent word
  counting problem.

  A benchmark with 2 CPUs:

  ```
  $ time WordCount-hs-parallel gutenberg-500MB.txt
  11242220 97050938 574714449 gutenberg-500MB.txt

  real    0m1.284s
  user    0m1.952s
  sys     0m0.140s
  ```

  These example programs have assumed ASCII encoded input data.  For UTF-8
  streams, we have a [concurrent wc implementation][WordCountUTF8.hs]
  with UTF-8 decoding.  This concurrent implementation performs as well
  as the standard `wc` program in serial benchmarks. In concurrent mode
  [Streamly][]'s implementation can utilise multiple processing cores if
  these are present, and can thereby run much faster than the standard
  binary.

  Streamly provides concurrency facilities similar
  to [OpenMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP) and
  [Cilk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilk) but with a more declarative
  style of expression.  With Streamly you can write concurrent programs
  with ease, with support for different types of concurrent scheduling.

  ### A Concurrent Network Server

  We now move to a slightly more complicated example: we simulate a
  dictionary lookup server which can serve word meanings to multiple
  clients concurrently.  This example demonstrates the use of the concurrent
  `mapM` combinator.

  Please see the file [WordServer.hs][] for the complete code for this
  example, including the imports that we have omitted below.

  ```haskell
  import qualified Streamly.Data.Fold as Fold
  import qualified Streamly.Network.Inet.TCP as TCP
  import qualified Streamly.Network.Socket as Socket
  import qualified Streamly.Unicode.Stream as Unicode

  -- Simulate network/db query by adding a delay.
  fetch :: String -> IO (String, String)
  fetch w = threadDelay 1000000 >> return (w,w)

  -- Read lines of whitespace separated list of words from a socket, fetch the
  -- meanings of each word concurrently and return the meanings separated by
  -- newlines, in same order as the words were received. Repeat until the
  -- connection is closed.
  lookupWords :: Socket -> IO ()
  lookupWords sk =
        Stream.unfold Socket.read sk               -- SerialT IO Word8
      & Unicode.decodeLatin1                       -- SerialT IO Char
      & Stream.wordsBy isSpace Fold.toList         -- SerialT IO String
      & Stream.fromSerial                          -- AheadT  IO String
      & Stream.mapM fetch                          -- AheadT  IO (String, String)
      & Stream.fromAhead                           -- SerialT IO (String, String)
      & Stream.map show                            -- SerialT IO String
      & Stream.intersperse "\n"                    -- SerialT IO String
      & Unicode.encodeStrings Unicode.encodeLatin1 -- SerialT IO (Array Word8)
      & Stream.fold (Socket.writeChunks sk)        -- IO ()

  serve :: Socket -> IO ()
  serve sk = finally (lookupWords sk) (close sk)

  -- | Run a server on port 8091. Accept and handle connections concurrently. The
  -- connection handler is "serve" (i.e. lookupWords).  You can use "telnet" or
  -- "nc" as a client to try it out.
  main :: IO ()
  main =
        Stream.unfold TCP.acceptOnPort 8091 -- SerialT IO Socket
      & Stream.fromSerial                   -- AsyncT IO ()
      & Stream.mapM serve                   -- AsyncT IO ()
      & Stream.fromAsync                    -- SerialT IO ()
      & Stream.drain                        -- IO ()
  ```

  ### Merging Incoming Streams

  In the next example, we show how to merge logs coming from multiple
  nodes in your network.  These logs are merged at line boundaries and
  the merged logs are written to a file or to a network destination.
  This example uses the `concatMapWith` combinator to merge multiple
  streams concurrently.

  Please see the file [MergeServer.hs][] for the complete working code,
  including the imports that we have omitted below.

  ```haskell
  import qualified Streamly.Data.Unfold as Unfold
  import qualified Streamly.Network.Socket as Socket

  -- | Read a line stream from a socket.
  -- Note: lines are buffered, and we could add a limit to the
  -- buffering for safety.
  readLines :: Socket -> SerialT IO (Array Char)
  readLines sk =
      Stream.unfold Socket.read sk                 -- SerialT IO Word8
    & Unicode.decodeLatin1                         -- SerialT IO Char
    & Stream.splitWithSuffix (== '\n') Array.write -- SerialT IO String

  recv :: Socket -> SerialT IO (Array Char)
  recv sk = Stream.finally (liftIO $ close sk) (readLines sk)

  -- | Starts a server at port 8091 listening for lines with space separated
  -- words. Multiple clients can connect to the server and send streams of lines.
  -- The server handles all the connections concurrently, merges the incoming
  -- streams at line boundaries and writes the merged stream to a file.
  server :: Handle -> IO ()
  server file =
        Stream.unfold TCP.acceptOnPort 8090        -- SerialT IO Socket
      & Stream.concatMapWith Stream.parallel recv  -- SerialT IO (Array Char)
      & Stream.unfoldMany Array.read               -- SerialT IO Char
      & Unicode.encodeLatin1                       -- SerialT IO Word8
      & Stream.fold (Handle.write file)            -- IO ()

  main :: IO ()
  main = withFile "output.txt" AppendMode server
  ```

  ### Listing Directories Recursively/Concurrently

  Our next example lists a directory tree recursively, reading
  multiple directories concurrently.

  This example uses the tree traversing combinator `iterateMapLeftsWith`.
  This combinator maps a stream generator on the `Left` values in its
  input stream (directory names in this case), feeding the resulting `Left`
  values back to the input, while it lets the `Right` values (file names
  in this case) pass through to the output. The `Stream.ahead` stream
  joining combinator then makes it iterate on the directories concurrently.

  Please see the file [ListDir.hs][] for the complete working code,
  including the imports that we have omitted below.

  ```haskell
  import Streamly.Internal.Data.Stream.IsStream (iterateMapLeftsWith)

  import qualified Streamly.Prelude as Stream
  import qualified Streamly.Internal.FileSystem.Dir as Dir (toEither)

  -- Lists a directory as a stream of (Either Dir File).
  listDir :: String -> SerialT IO (Either String String)
  listDir dir =
        Dir.toEither dir               -- SerialT IO (Either String String)
      & Stream.map (bimap mkAbs mkAbs) -- SerialT IO (Either String String)

      where mkAbs x = dir ++ "/" ++ x

  -- | List the current directory recursively using concurrent processing.
  main :: IO ()
  main = do
      hSetBuffering stdout LineBuffering
      let start = Stream.fromPure (Left ".")
      Stream.iterateMapLeftsWith Stream.ahead listDir start
          & Stream.mapM_ print
  ```

  ### Rate Limiting

  For bounded concurrent streams, a stream yield rate can be specified
  easily.  For example, to print "tick" once every second you can simply
  write:

  ```haskell
  main :: IO ()
  main =
        Stream.repeatM (pure "tick")  -- AsyncT IO String
      & Stream.timestamped            -- AsyncT IO (AbsTime, String)
      & Stream.avgRate 1              -- AsyncT IO (AbsTime, String)
      & Stream.fromAsync              -- SerialT IO (AbsTime, String)
      & Stream.mapM_ print            -- IO ()
  ```

  Please see the file [Rate.hs][] for the complete working code.

  The concurrency of the stream is automatically controlled to match the
  specified rate. [Streamly][]'s rate control works precisely even at
  throughputs as high as millions of yields per second.

  For more sophisticated rate control needs please see the Streamly [reference
  documentation][Streamly].

  ### Reactive Programming

  Streamly supports reactive (time domain) programming because of its
  support for declarative concurrency. Please see the `Streamly.Prelude`
  module for time-specific combinators like `intervalsOf`, and
  folds like `takeInterval` in `Streamly.Internal.Data.Fold`.
  Please also see the pre-release sampling combinators in the
  `Streamly.Internal.Data.Stream.IsStream.Top` module for `throttle` and
  `debounce` like operations.

  The examples [AcidRain.hs][] and [CirclingSquare.hs][] demonstrate
  reactive programming using [Streamly][].

  ## Performance

  As you have seen in the word count example above, [Streamly][] offers
  highly modular abstractions for building programs while also offering
  the performance close to an equivalent (imperative) C program.

  Streamly offers excellent performance even for byte-at-a-time stream
  operations using efficient abstractions like `Unfold`s and terminating
  `Fold`s.  Byte-at-a-time stream operations can simplify programming
  because the developer does not have to deal explicitly with chunking
  and re-combining data.

  Streamly exploits GHC's stream fusion optimizations (`case-of-case` and
  `spec-constr`) aggressively to achieve C-like speed, while also offering
  highly modular abstractions to developers.

  [Streamly][] will usually perform very well without any
  compiler plugins.  However, we have fixed some deficiencies
  that we had noticed in GHC's optimizer using a [compiler
  plugin](https://github.com/composewell/fusion-plugin).  We hope to fold
  these optimizations into GHC in the future; until then we recommend that
  you use this plugin for applications that are performance sensitive.

  ### Benchmarks

  We measured several Haskell streaming implementations
  using various micro-benchmarks. Please see the [streaming
  benchmarks][streaming-benchmarks] page for a detailed comparison of
  Streamly against other streaming libraries.

  Our results show that [Streamly][] is the fastest effectful streaming
  implementation on almost all the measured microbenchmarks. In many cases
  it runs up to 100x faster, and in some cases even 1000x faster than
  some of the tested alternatives. In some composite operation benchmarks
  [Streamly][] turns out to be significantly faster than Haskell's list
  implementation.

  *Note*: If you can write a program in some other way or with some other
  language that runs significantly faster than what [Streamly][] offers,
  please let us know and we will improve.

  ## Notes

  Streamly comes equipped with a very powerful set of abstractions to
  accomplish many kinds of programming tasks: it provides support for
  programming with streams and arrays, for reading and writing from the
  file system and from the network, for time domain programming (reactive
  programming), and for reacting to file system events using `fsnotify`.

  Please view [Streamly's documentation][Streamly] for more information
  about Streamly's features.

  ### Concurrency

  Streamly uses lock-free synchronization for achieving concurrent
  operation with low overheads.  The number of tasks performed concurrently
  are determined automatically based on the rate at which a consumer
  is consuming the results. In other words, you do not need to manage
  thread pools or decide how many threads to use for a particular task.
  For CPU-bound tasks Streamly will try to keep the number of threads
  close to the number of CPUs available; for IO-bound tasks it will utilize
  more threads.

  The parallelism available during program execution can be utilized with
  very little overhead even where the task size is very
  small, because Streamly will automatically switch between
  serial or batched execution of tasks on the same CPU depending
  on whichever is more efficient.  Please see our [concurrency
  benchmarks][concurrency-benchmarks] for more detailed performance
  measurements, and for a comparison with the `async` package.

  ### Design Goals

  Our goals for [Streamly][] from the very beginning have been:

  1. To achieve simplicity by unifying abstractions.
  2. To offer high performance.

  These goals are hard to achieve simultaneously because they are usually
  inversely related.  We have spent many years trying to get the abstractions
  right without compromising performance.

  `Unfold` is an example of an abstraction that we have created to achieve
  high performance when mapping streams on streams.  `Unfold` allows stream
  generation to be optimized well by the compiler through stream fusion.
  A `Fold` with termination capability is another example which modularizes
  stream elimination operations through stream fusion.  Terminating folds
  can perform many simple parsing tasks that do not require backtracking.
  In Streamly, `Parser`s are a natural extension to terminating `Fold`s;
  `Parser`s add the ability to backtrack to `Fold`s.  Unification leads
  to simpler abstractions and lower cognitive overheads while also not
  compromising performance.
