description: ! "# streaming-bracketed\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/danidiaz/streaming-bracketed.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/danidiaz/streaming-bracketed)\n\n##
  What's this?\n\nA resource management \"decorator\" for the `Stream` type from\n[streaming](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming).
  \ \n\nThe idea is that the `Bracketed` type represents a `Stream` which might have\nsome
  finalizers that will be triggered when we reach a given point in the\nstream.\n\nBy
  being careful about how we lift operations to work on `Bracketed` streams,\nwe can
  ensure that finalizers are promptly called even with operations like\n`take`.\n\n`Bracketed`
  streams are ultimately consumed by using a continuation.\n\n## Differences with
  resourcet\n\n[resourcet](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/resourcet) is a widely
  used\nlibrary for resource handling. It provides a monad transformer over IO that\nkeeps
  track of registered resources and ensures proper cleanup.\n\nThe main differences
  with the present library are:\n\n- This library only works on `Stream`s from streaming.\n\n-
  `Bracketed` sits above the streaming monad, not below like `ResourceT`.\n\n- This
  library aims to provide smarter handling of stream functions like\n  `take`, without
  too much hassle.\n\n- In this library finalizer scopes are nested, unlike `ResourceT`
  which allows\n  arbitrary interleavings. \n\n## Doubts\n\n- Lifting functions like
  `splitAt` might cause problems if we try to use the\n  rest of the stream.\n\n##
  Motivation\n\nFrom the\n[CHANGELOG](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming-0.2.1.0/changelog)
  of\nthe [streaming](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming) package:\n\n>
  Remove bracketStream, MonadCatch instance, and everything dealing with\n> ResourceT.
  All of these things of sort of broken for Stream since there is no\n> guarantee
  of linear consumption (functions like take can prevent finalizers\n> from running).\n\n[One
  Github issue](https://github.com/haskell-streaming/streaming/issues/52).\n\n[Another
  one](https://github.com/haskell-streaming/streaming-with/issues/2).\n\n[Streaming
  libs exercise/challenge](https://twitter.com/DiazCarrete/status/1016073374458671104):\n\n>
  Given a list [(Filepath,Int,Int)] of files and line ranges, create a stream\n> of
  lines belonging to the concatenated ranges.\n\n> Prompt release of file handles
  is required. resource-handling monads and\n> \"withXXX\"-style functions are allowed.\n\n"
