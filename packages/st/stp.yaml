  # Simple Theorem Prover

  Simple Theorem Prover is a proof tree generator. It allows for specifying axioms and inference rules, and then by quering the program it will produce all valid combinations of inference in attempt to reach a target result.

  This project is based on [Simple theorem prover in Racket](https://bor0.wordpress.com/2018/08/07/simple-theorem-prover-in-racket/).

  ## Prerequisites

  ## Installation

  1. Run `cabal sandbox init`
  1. Run `cabal install` to install dependencies and build this project
