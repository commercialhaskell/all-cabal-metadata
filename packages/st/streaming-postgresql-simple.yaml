synopsis: Stream postgresql-query results using the streaming library
changelog: ! "# Revision history for streaming-postgresql-simple\n\n## 0.2.0.3  --
  2018-01-02\n\n* Inline the exception handling code. In `streaming-0.1` this was
  provided by\n  `exceptions` instances, but in `streaming-0.2` these instances were
  removed.\n  Rather than rely on the instances, I've just added the implementations\n
  \ privately.\n\n## 0.2.0.2  -- 2018-01-02\n\n* Increase upper-bound of `streaming`
  to allow for 0.2\n\n## 0.2.0.1\n\nIncrease upper bound of `base`.\n\n## 0.2.0.0
  \ -- 2017-02-03\n\n### Correctly perform finalisation in `query` functions.\n\nThe
  previous implementation would perform the necessary finalisation only if the\nstream
  was drained. Some handling was in-place such that exceptions wouldn't\ncause the
  stream to end prematurely, but this isn't enough. We now use \n`MonadResource` to
  register an action to drain the stream.\n\nUsers should now wrap calls using `query`
  with `runResourceT`:\n\n```haskell\n>>> runResourceT (S.mapM_ print (query c \"SELECT
  * FROM t\"))\n```\n\n### Correctly deal with transactions in `stream`\n\n`stream`
  requires a transaction in order to function. If there isn't a \ntransaction open,
  `stream` would create one, but if you manually called `commit`\nor `rollback` from
  within the stream, the internal state would become \ninconsistent. This would lead
  to confusing error messages.\n\nWe now watch the transaction state as we pull items
  out from the stream, and\ninform the user if the internal state is not what we expected.
  Further more,\ncleanup actions (commit/rolling back the transaction) now only happen
  if there\nis still a transaction open. \n\n\n## 0.1.0.0  -- 2017-02-02\n\n* First
  version. Released on an unsuspecting world. Mwahaha.\n"
