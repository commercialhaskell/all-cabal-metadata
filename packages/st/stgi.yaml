  guide\n----------------\n\nIf you want to have a quick look at the STG, here is
  what you need to get going.\nThe program should build with both [`stack`][stack]
  and [`cabal`][cabal].\n\nThe `app/Main.hs` file is written so you can easily switch
  out the `prog` value\nfor other `Program`s that contain a `main` definition. The
  `Stg.ExamplePrograms`\nmodule provides a number of examples that might be worth
  having a look, and are\na good starting point for modifications or adding your own
  programs. It's\nprobably easier to read in Haddock format, so go ahead and run\n\n```bash\nstack
  haddock --open stgi\n```\n\nand have a look at the example programs.\n\nWhen you're
  happy with your `app/Main.hs`, run\n\n```bash\nstack build --exec \"stgi-exe --colour=true\"
  | less -R\n```\n\nto get coloured output in `less`. Type `/====` to search for `====`,
  which\nfinds the top of every new step; use `n` (next step) or `N` (previous step)
  to\nnavigate through the execution.\n\n\nAbout the machine\n-----------------\n\nThe
  spineless tagless graph reduction machine, STG for short, is an automaton\nused
  to map non-strict functional languages onto stock hardware. It was\ndeveloped for,
  and is heavily used in, [the Haskell compiler GHC][ghc].\n\nThis project implements
  an interpreter for the STG as it is [described in the\n1992 paper on the subject][stg1992],
  with the main focus on being nice to a\nhuman user. Things that might be important
  for an actual compiler backend, such\nas performance or static analysis, are not
  considered in general, only if it\nhelps the understanding of the STG.\n\nThe idea
  behind the machine is to represent the program in its abstract syntax\ntree form.
  However, due to references to other parts of the syntax tree, a\nprogram is a graph,
  not a tree. By evaluating this graph using a small set of\nrules, it can be systematically
  reduced to a final value, which will be the\nresult of the program.\n\nThe STG is\n
  \ - **spineless** because the graph is not represented as a single data\n    structure
  in memory, but as a set of small, individual parts of the graph\n    that reference
  each other. An important part of the evaluation mechanism is\n    how to follow
  these references.\n  - **tagless** because all heap values - unevaluated values,
  functions, already\n    evaluated values - are represented alike on the heap, in
  form of closures.\n    Tag*ful* would mean these closures have to be annotated with
  things like\n    type information, or whether they were previously evaluated already.\n
  \ - **graph reducing** because heap objects can be overwritten by simpler values\n
  \   the machine has found out to be equivalent. For example, the computation\n    `1+1`
  on the heap might be overwritten by a constant `2` once that result\n    has been
  obtained somewhere.\n\n\nUseful applications\n-------------------\n\nSTGi was started
  to teach myself about the STG. Not long into the project, I\ndecided to extend it
  to save others the many detours I had to take to implement\nit. In that sense, it
  can be a useful tool if you're interested in the\nlower-level properties of a Haskell
  implementation. I did my best to keep the\ncode readable, and added some decent
  Haddock/comment coverage. Speaking of\nHaddock: it's an excellent tool to start
  looking around the project before\ndigging into the source!\n\nThe other benefit
  is for teaching others: instead (or in addition to!) of\nexplaining certain common
  Haskell issues on a whiteboard with boxes and arrows,\nyou can share an interactive
  view of common programs with others. The example\nprograms feature some interesting
  cases.\n\n1. Does this leak memory? On the stack or the heap?\n2. I heard GHC doesn't
  have a call stack?!\n3. Why is this value not garbage collected?\n4. Why are lists
  sometimes not very performant?\n5. How many steps does this small, innocent function
  take to produce a result?\n\n\nLanguage introduction\n---------------------\n\nThe
  STG language can be seen as a mostly simplified version of Haskell with a\ncouple
  of lower level additions. The largest difference is probably that STG is\nan untyped
  language.\n\nThe syntax will be discussed below. For now, as an appetizer, the familiar\nHaskell
  code\n\n```haskell\nfoldl' _ acc [] = acc\nfoldl' f acc (y:ys) = case f acc y of\n\t!acc'
  -> foldl' f acc' ys\n\nsum = foldl' add 0\n```\n\ncould be translated to\n\n```haskell\nfoldl'
  = \\f acc xs -> case xs of\n    Nil -> acc;\n    Cons y ys -> case f acc y of\n
  \       acc' -> foldl' f acc' ys;\n    badList -> Error_foldl' badList;\n\nsum =
  \\ -> foldl' add zero;\n\nzero = \\ -> Int# 0#\n```\n\n\n### Top-level\n\nAn STG
  program consists of a set of bindings, each of the form\n\n```haskell\nname = \\(<free
  vars>) <bound vars> -> <expression body>\n```\n\nThe right-hand side is called a
  *lambda form*, and is closely related to the\nusual lambda from Haskell.\n\n  -
  Bound variables are the lambda parameters just like in Haskell.\n  - Free variables
  are the variables used in the `body` that are not bound or\n    global. This means
  that variables from the parent scope are not\n    automatically in scope, but you
  can get them into scope by adding them to\n    the free variables list.\n\n### The
  `main` value, termination\n\nIn the default configuration, program execution starts
  by moving the definitions\ngiven in the source code onto the heap, and then evaluating
  the `main` value. It\nwill continue to run until there is no rule applicable to
  the current state. Due\nto the lazy IO implementation, you can load indefinitely
  running programs in\nyour pager application and step as long forward as you want.\n\n###
  Expressions\n\nExpressions can, in general, be one of a couple of alternatives.\n\n
  \ - **Letrec**\n\n    ```haskell\n    letrec <...bindings...> in <expression>\n
  \   ```\n\n    Introduce local definitions, just like Haskell's `let`.\n\n  - **Let**\n\n
  \   ```haskell\n    let <...bindings...> in <expression>\n    ```\n\n    Like `letrec`,
  but the bindings cannot refer to each other (or themselves).\n    In other words,
  `let` is non-recursive.\n\n  - **Case**\n\n    ```haskell\n    case <expression>
  of <alts>\n    ```\n\n    Evaluate the `<expression>` (called scrutinee) to WHNF
  and continue\n    evaluating the matching alternative. Note that the WHNF part makes
  case\n    strict, and indeed it is the *only* construct that does evaluation.\n\n
  \   The `<alts>` are semicolon-separated list of alternatives of the form\n\n    ```haskell\n
  \   Constructor <args> -> <expression> -- algebraic\n    1# -> <expression>                 --
  primitive\n    ```\n\n    and can be either all algebraic or all primitive. In case
  of algebraic\n    alternatives, the constructor's arguments are in scope in the
  following\n    expression, just like in Haskell's pattern matching.\n\n    Each
  list of alts must include a default alternative at the end, which can\n    optinally
  bind a variable.\n\n    ```haskell\n    v -> <expression>       -- bound default;
  v is in scope in the expression\n    default -> <expression> -- unbound default\n
  \   ```\n\n  - **Function application**\n\n    ```haskell\n    function <args>\n
  \   ```\n\n    Like Haskell's function application. The `<args>` are primitive values
  or\n    variables.\n\n  - **Primitive application**\n\n    ```haskell\n    primop#
  <arg1> <arg2>\n    ```\n\n    Primitive operation on unboxed integers.\n\n    The
  following operations are supported:\n\n      - Arithmetic\n        - `+#`: addition\n
  \       - `-#`: subtraction\n        - `*#`: multiplication\n        - `/#`: integer
  division (truncated towards -∞)\n        - `%#`: modulo (truncated towards -∞)\n
  \     - Boolean, returning `1#` for truth and `0#` for falsehood:\n        `<#`,
  `<=#`, `==#`, `/=#`, `>=#`, `>#`\n\n  - **Constructor application**\n\n    ```haskell\n
  \   Constructor <args>\n    ```\n\n    An algebraic data constructor applied to
  a number of arguments, just like\n    function application. Note that constructors
  always have to be saturated\n    (not partially applied); to get a partially applied
  constructor, wrap it in\n    a lambda form that fills in the missing arguments with
  parameters.\n\n  - **Primitive literal**\n\n    An integer postfixed with `#`, like
  `123#`.\n\nFor example, Haskell's `maybe` function could be implemented in STG like
  this:\n\n```haskell\nmaybe = \\nothing just x -> case x of\n    Just j   -> just
  j;\n    Nothing  -> nothing;\n    badMaybe -> Error_badMaybe badMaybe\n```\n\nSome
  lambda expressions can only contain certain sub-elements; these special\ncases are
  detailed in the sections below. To foreshadow these issues:\n\n- Lambda forms always
  have lifted (not primitive) type\n- Lambda forms with non-empty argument lists and
  standard constructors are never\n  updatable\n\n\n### Updates\n\nA lambda form can
  optionally use a double arrow `=>`, instead of a normal arrow `->`.\nThis tells
  the machine to update the lambda form's value in memory once it has\nbeen calculated,
  so the computation does not have to be repeated should the\nvalue be required again.
  This is the mechanism that is key to the lazy\nevaluation model the STG implements.
  For example, evaluating `main` in\n\n```haskell\nadd2 = … -- <add two boxed ints>\none
  = \\ -> Int# 1#;\ntwo = \\ -> Int# 2#;\nmain = \\ => add2 one two\n```\n\nwould,
  once the computation returns, overwrite `main` (modulo technical\ndetails) with\n\n```haskell\nmain
  = \\ -> Int# 3#\n```\n\nA couple of things to keep in mind:\n\n- Closures with non-empty
  argument lists and constructors are already in WHNF,\n  so they are never updatable.\n-
  When a value is only entered once, updating it is unnecessary work. Deciding\n  whether
  a potentially updatable closure should actually be updatable is what\n  the *update
  analysis* would do in a compiler when translating into the STG.\n\n\n\n### Pitfalls\n\n-
  Semicolons are an annoyance that allows the grammar to be simpler. This\n  tradeoff
  was chosen to keep the project's code simpler, but this may change\n  in the future.\n\n
  \ For now, the semicolon rule is that **bindings and alternatives are\n  semicolon-separated**.\n\n-
  Lambda forms stand for deferred computations, and as such cannot have\n  primitive
  type, which are always in normal form. To handle primitive types,\n  you'll have
  to box them like in\n\n  ```haskell\n  three = \\ -> Int# 3#\n  ```\n\n  Writing\n\n
  \ ```haskell\n  three' = \\ -> 3#\n  ```\n\n  is invalid, and the machine would
  halt in an error state. You'll notice that\n  the unboxing-boxing business is quite
  laborious, and this is precisely the\n  reason unboxed values alone are so fast
  in GHC.\n\n- Function application cannot be nested, since function arguments are
  primitives\n  or variables. Haskell's `map f (map g xs)` would be written\n\n  ```haskell\n
  \ let map_g_xs = \\ -> map g xs\n  in map f map_g_xs\n  ```\n\n  assuming all variables
  are in global scope. This means that nesting functions\n  in Haskell results in
  a heap allocation via `let`.\n\n- Free variable values have to be explicitly given
  to closures. Function\n  composition could be implemented like\n\n  ```haskell\n
  \ compose = \\f g x -> let gx = \\(g x) -> g x\n                      in f gx\n
  \ ```\n\n  Forgetting to hand `g` and `x` to the `gx` lambda form would mean that
  in the\n  `g x` call neither of them was in scope, and the machine would halt with\n
  \ a \"variable not in scope\" error.\n\n  This applies even for recursive functions,
  which have to be given to\n  their own list of free variables, like in `rep` in
  the following example:\n\n  ```haskell\n  replicate = \\x -> let rep = \\(rep x)
  -> Cons x rep\n  \t\t\t\t    in rep\n  ```\n\n\n### Code example\n\nThe 1992 paper
  gives two implementations of the `map` function in section 4.1.\nThe first one is
  the STG version of\n\n```haskell\nmap f [] = []\nmap f (y:ys) = f y : map f ys\n```\n\nwhich,
  in this STG implementation, would be written\n\n```haskell\nmap = \\f xs -> case
  xs of\n    Nil -> Nil;\n    Cons y ys -> let fy = \\(f y) => f y;\n                     mfy
  = \\(f ys) => map f ys\n                 in Cons fy mfy;\n    badList -> Error_map
  badList\n```\n\nFor comparison, the paper's version is\n\n```haskell\nmap = {} \\n
  {f,xs} -> case xs of\n    Nil {} -> Nil {}\n    Cons {y,ys} -> let fy = {f,y} \\u
  {} -> f {y}\n                       mfy = {f,ys} \\u {} -> map {f,ys}\n                   in
  Cons {fy,mfy}\n    badList -> Error_map {badList}\n```\n\nYou can find lots of further
  examples of standard Haskell functions implemented\nby hand in STG in the `Prelude`
  modules. Combined with the above explanations,\nthis is all you should need to get
  started.\n\n\n\n### Marshalling values\n\nThe `Stg.Marshal` module provides functions
  to inject Haskell values into the\nSTG (`toStg`), and extract them from a machine
  state again (`toStg`). These\nfunctions are tremendously useful in practice, make
  use of them! After chasing a\nlist value on the heap manually you'll know the value
  of `fromStg`, and in order\nto get data structures into the STG you have to write
  a lot of code, and be\ncareful doing it at that. Keep in mind that `fromStg` requires
  the value to  be\nin normal form, or extraction will fail.\n\n\n\nRuntime behaviour\n-----------------\n\nThe
  following steps are an overview of the evaluation rules. Running the STG in\nverbose
  mode (`-v2`) will provide a more detailed description of what happened\neach particular
  step.\n\n### Code segment\n\nThe code segment is the current instruction the machine
  evaluates.\n\n- **Eval** evaluates expressions.\n    - **Function application**
  pushes the function's arguments on the stack\n      and **Enter**s the address of
  the function.\n\t- **Constructor applications** simply transition into the\n\t  **ReturnCon**
  state when evaluated.\n\t- Similarly, **primitive ints** transition into the **ReturnInt**
  state.\n\t- **Case** pushes a return frame, and proceeds evaluating the scrutinee.\n\t-
  **Let(rec)** allocates heap closures, and extends the local environment\n\t  with
  the new bindings.\n- **Enter** evaluates memory addresses by looking up the value
  at a memory\n  address on the heap, and evaluating its body.\n  \t- If the closure
  entered is updatable, push an update frame so it can later\n\t  be overwritten with
  the value it evaluates to.\n\t- If the closure takes any arguments, supply it with
  values taken from\n\t  argument frames.\n- **ReturnCon** instructs the machine to
  branch depending on which constructor\n  is present, by popping a return frame.\n-
  **ReturnInt** does the same, but for primitive values.\n\n### Stack\n\nThe stack
  has three different kinds of frames.\n\n- **Argument** frames store pending function
  arguments. They are pushed when\n  evaluating a function applied to arguments, and
  popped when entering a closure\n  that has a non-empty argument list.\n- **Return**
  frames are pushed when evaluating a `case` expression, in order to\n  know where
  to continue once the scrutinee has been evaluated. They are popped\n  when evaluating
  constructors or primitive values.\n- **Update** frames block access to argument
  and return frames. If an evaluation\n  step needs to pop one of them but there is
  an update frame in the way, it can\n  get rid the update frame by overriding the
  memory address pointed to by it\n  with the current value being evaluated, and retrying
  the evaluation now that\n  the update frame is gone. This mechanism is what enables
  lazy evaluation in\n  the STG.\n\n### Heap\n\nThe heap is a mapping from memory
  addresses to heap objects, which can be\nclosures or black holes (see below). Heap
  entries are allocated by `let(rec)`,\nand deallocated by garbage collection.\n\nAs
  a visual guide to the user, closures are annotated with `Fun` (takes\narguments),
  `Con` (data constructors), and `Thunk` (suspended computations).\n\n\n### Black
  holes\n\nThe heap does not only contain closures, but also black holes. Black holes
  are\nannotated with the step in which they were created; this annotation is purely\nfor
  display purposes, and not used by the machine.\n\nAt runtime, when an updatable
  closure is entered (evaluated), it is overwritten\nby a black hole. Black holes
  do not only provide better overview over what\nthunk is currently evaluated, but
  have two useful technical benefits:\n\n1. Memory mentioned only in the closure is
  now ready to be collected,\n   avoiding certain space leaks. [The 1992 paper][stg1992]
  gives the following\n   example in section 9.3.3:\n\n   ```haskell\n   list = \\(x)
  => <long list>\n   l = \\(list) => last list\n   ```\n\n   When entering `l` without
  black holes, the entire `list` is kept in memory\n   until `last` is done. On the
  other hand, overwriting `l` with a black hole\n   upon entering deletes the `last`
  pointer from it, and `last` can run, and be\n   garbage collected, incrementally.\n\n2.
  Entering a black hole means a thunk depends on itself, allowing the\n interpreter
  to catch some non-terminating computations with a useful error\n\n\n### Garbage
  collection\n\nCurrently, two garbage collection algorithms are implemented:\n\n-
  **Tri-state tracing**: free all unused memory addresses, and does not touch\n  the
  others. This makes following specific closures on the heap easy.\n- **Two-space
  copying**: move all used memory addresses to the beginning of the\n  heap, and discard
  all those that weren't moved. This has the advantage of\n  reordering the heap roughly
  in the order the closures will be accessed by the\n  program again, but the disadvantage
  of making things harder to track, since\n  for example the `main` value might appear
  in several different locations\n  throughout the run of a program.\n\n\n### Unhelpful
  error message?\n\nThe goal of this project is being useful to human readers. If
  you find an error\nmessage that is unhelpful or even misleading, please open an
  issue with a\nminimal example on how to reproduce it!\n\n\n\nDifferences from the
  1992 paper\n-------------------------------\n\n### Grammar\n\n- Function application
  uses no parentheses or commas like in Haskell `f x y z`,\n  not with curly parentheses
  and commas like in the paper `f {x,y,z}`.\n- Comment syntax like in Haskell\n- Constructors
  can end with a `#` to allow labelling primitive boxes\n  e.g. with `Int#`.\n- A
  lambda's head is written `\\(free) bound -> body`, where `free` and\n  `bound` are
  space-separated variable lists, instead of the paper's\n  `{free} \\n {bound} ->
  body`, which uses comma-separated lists. The\n  update flag `\\u` is signified using
  a double arrow `=>` instead of the\n  normal arrow `->`.\n\n### Evaluation\n\n-
  The three stacks from the operational semantics given in the paper - argument,\n
  \ return, and update - are unified into a single one, since they run\n  synchronously
  anyway. This makes the current location in the evaluation much\n  clearer, since
  the stack is always popped from the top. For example, having a\n  return frame at
  the top means the program is close to a `case` expression.\n- Although heap closures
  are all represented alike, they are classified for the\n  user in the visual output:\n
  \   - Constructors are closures with a constructor application body, and\n      only
  free variables.\n    - Other closures with only free variables are thunks.\n    -
  Closures with non-empty argument lists are functions.\n\n\n\nGHC's current STG\n-----------------\n\nThe
  implementation here uses the *push/enter* evaluation model of the STG, which\nis
  fairly elegant, and was initially thought to also be top in terms of\nperformance.
  As it turned out, the latter is not the case, and another\nevaluation model called
  *eval/apply*, which treats (only) function application a\nbit different, is faster
  in practice.\n\nThis notable revision is documented in [the 2004 paper *How to make
  a fast\ncurry*][fastcurry]. I don't have plans to support this evaluation model
  right\nnow, but it's on my list of long-term goals (alongside the current push/enter).\n\n\n\n[cabal]:
