  # Release history for stack-all

  ## 0.3.1 (2021-09-06)
  - newest LTS for a project can now be configured
  - use cached-json-file for snapshots.json
  - add --keep-going
  - exclude lts17 now by default

  ## 0.3 (2021-06-26)
  - use hackage.stackage.org/snapshots.json:
    - to determine the latest LTS major version
    - to resolve major LTS version to latest minor snapshot and also print it
  - cache snapshots.json locally in ~/.cache/stack-all/ for a few hours
  - new --make-lts command to generate a stack-ltsXX.yaml file from newer one

  ## 0.2.2 (2021-06-07)
  - create a stack.yaml file if only an .cabal file is found

  ## 0.2.1 (2021-04-30)
  - if stack fails, print the ~/.stack snapshot path for reference

  ## 0.2 (2021-04-03)
  - better error messages when reading snapshot option/arg (TristanCacqueray)
  - search parent dirs for stack project dir, like stack
  - snapshot options/args can now be in compact ltsXY form as well as lts-XY
  - support stack commands and options

  ## 0.1.2 (2021-02-05)
  - --create-config comment line mentions older version
  - show error for unversioned "stack-lts.yaml"
  - add lts-17

  ## 0.1.1 (2020-12-04)
  - fix ordering of stack-lts-*.yaml
  - allow --newest to override oldest lts config

  ## 0.1.0 (2020-11-14)
  - initial release with --create-config, --debug, --cmd, --newest
  - VersionSpec: --all-lts, --oldest, and lts args

  # stack-all

  A CLI tool for building Haskell projects easily over Stackage major versions.

  This is how I do my Haskell build CI for projects locally with stack.

  ## Usage

  `stack-all` by default runs `stack build` over
  recent Stackage LTS major versions and Nightly
  (current default is nightly & LTS 18, 16, 14, 13, 12, 11)
  corresponding to latest major ghc minor versions,
  using the stack's `--resolver` option.

  Note that `stack` only works if a `stack.yaml` file exists.
  If no `stack.yaml` file is found, `stack-all` will create one.
  Of course it may still fail to build, but this allows for
  quickly trying to build a package that does not include stack support.

  ### Overriding stack.yaml
  `stack-all` can use `stack-ltsXX.yaml` files to override the default `stack.yaml`
  file for particular LTS major versions. Note that a `stack-ltsXX.yaml` file
  will also be used for older LTS major versions until
  another `stack-ltsYY.yaml` file is found.

  For example if you have `stack-lts14.yaml` and `stack-lts12.yaml` files
  in your project,
  then `stack.yaml` will be used as normal to build nightly, lts-18 and lts-16,
  but `stack-lts14.yaml` will be used for building lts-14 and lts-13,
  and `stack-lts12.yaml` will be used for lts-12, lts-11 (and older).
  Since `stack-all` overrides the resolver with `--resolver lts-XX`
  the exact minor LTS version specified in the `stack*.yaml` files
  doesn't actually matter: `stack-all` always uses the latest minor release of
  the LTS major version according to Stackage.

  `stack-ltsXX.yaml` files can be easily prepared using
  `stack-all --make-lts ltsXX` (or `-s ltsXX` for short).

  (Other versioned stack.yaml filenames like stack-ghc-8.8.yaml
  are not currently supported.)

  ### Specifying LTS versions
  You can abbreviate `lts-XX` args to `ltsXX` on the commandline.

  There are `--oldest`  and `--newest` options to specify the range of
  lts versions to build over:

  You can specify the oldest major LTS to build for with eg `stack-all -o lts13`.
  Otherwise if not configured the default oldest LTS is currently `lts-11`.

  Similarly you can specify the newest LTS version to build from with
  eg `stack-all -n lts16`. (The default is to build from nightly.)

  Alternatively, one can give one or more explicit LTS major versions to build for
  as arguments: eg `stack-all lts14` if you only wish to build that version.

  ### Configuring the oldest and/or newest LTS to build
  You can configure the oldest working LTS major version for your project
  by running for example `stack-all -c -o lts-13` which generates a `.stack-all`
  project config file like this:
  ```
  [versions]
  # lts-12 too old
  oldest = lts-13
  ```
  (the comment line can be used to document why the older LTS doesn't work).
  This specifies that the oldest LTS version to build for is lts-13.

  The newest LTS to build with stack-all can similarly be configured:
  `stack-all -c -n lts18` or setting `newest = lts-18`.

  ### Running other stack commands
  By default `stack-all` just runs the stack `build` command over LTS versions.

  You can also specify a stack command to run with options on the commandline:
  eg
  ```
  $ stack-all test --no-rerun-tests
  ```
  will run `stack test` over the LTS versions instead.

  Happy stack building!

  ## Install
  The project is released on Hackage.

  You can also build from git source with `stack install` or `cabal install`.
