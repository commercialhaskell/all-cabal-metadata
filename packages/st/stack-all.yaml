  # stack-all

  A CLI tool for building Haskell projects easily over Stackage major versions.

  This is how I do my Haskell build CI for projects locally with stack.

  ## Usage

  `stack-all` by default runs `stack build` over Stackage Nightly and
  LTS major versions
  (current default is nightly & major LTS versions back to lts-18)
  corresponding to latest major ghc minor versions,
  with appropriate stack `--resolver` options.

  Note that `stack` only works in a project if a `stack.yaml` file exists.
  If no `stack.yaml` file is found in a .cabal project,
  `stack-all` will create one.
  Of course it may still fail to build, but this allows for
  quickly experiments to build a package that does not include stack support.

  Since 0.6, stack-all also works outside projects, like stack itself does.

  ### Help output
  `$ stack-all --version`

  ```
  0.6
  ```
  `$ stack-all --help`

  ```
  Build over Stackage versions

  Usage: stack-all [--version] [(-c|--create-config) | (-s|--make-lts)]
                   [-k|--keep-going] [-d|--debug] [--refresh-cache]
                   [-n|--newest MAJOR] [(-o|--oldest MAJOR) | (-a|--all-lts)]
                   [MAJORVER... [COMMAND...]]

    stack-all builds projects easily across different Stackage versions

  Available options:
    -h,--help                Show this help text
    --version                Show version
    -c,--create-config       Create a project .stack-all file
    -s,--make-lts            Create a stack-ltsXX.yaml file
    -k,--keep-going          Keep going even if an LTS fails
    -d,--debug               Verbose stack build output on error
    --refresh-cache          Force refresh of stackage snapshots.json cache
    -n,--newest MAJOR        Newest LTS release to build from
    -o,--oldest MAJOR        Oldest compatible LTS release
    -a,--all-lts             Try to build back to LTS 1 even
  ```

  ### Overriding stack.yaml
  `stack-all` can use `stack-ltsXX.yaml` files to override the default
  `stack.yaml` file for particular Stackage major versions.
  Note that a `stack-ltsXX.yaml` file will also be used for
  older LTS major versions until another `stack-ltsYY.yaml` file is found.
  `stack-nightly.yaml` is also supported, but used only for nightly.

  For example if you have `stack-lts20.yaml` and `stack-lts18.yaml` files
  in your project,
  then `stack.yaml` will be used as normal to build nightly, lts-22 and lts-21,
  but `stack-lts20.yaml` will be used for building lts-20 and lts-19,
  and `stack-lts18.yaml` will be used for lts-18, lts-16 (and older).
  Since `stack-all` overrides the exact resolver with the latest minor snapshot,
  the exact minor Stackage version specified in the `stack*.yaml` files
  doesn't actually matter: `stack-all` always uses the latest published
  minor releases of Stackage major versions.

  `stack-ltsXX.yaml` files can be easily created using
  `stack-all --make-lts ltsXX` (or `-s ltsXX` for short).

  (Other versioned stack.yaml filenames like stack-ghc-8.8.yaml
  are not currently supported.)

  ### Specifying LTS versions
  You can abbreviate `lts-XX` args to `ltsXX` on the commandline.
  `lts` is also accepted and resolved to the latest major LTS version.

  You can also use ghc major version aliases:
  eg `ghc9.6` corresponds to `lts22` or `ghc-9.2` to `lts-20`.

  There are `--oldest`  and `--newest` options to specify the range of
  lts versions to build over:

  You can specify the oldest major LTS to build for with eg `stack-all -o lts16`.
  Otherwise if not configured the default oldest LTS is currently `lts-18`.

  Similarly you can specify the newest LTS version to build from with
  eg `stack-all -n lts20`. (The default is to build from nightly.)

  Alternatively, one can give one or more explicit LTS major versions to build
  for as arguments: eg `stack-all lts19` if you only wish to build that version.

  ### Configuring the oldest and/or newest LTS to build
  You can configure the oldest working LTS major version for your project
  by running for example `stack-all -c -o lts-19` which generates a `.stack-all`
  project config file like this:
  ```
  [versions]
  # lts-18 too old
  oldest = lts-19
  ```
  (the comment line can be used to document why the older LTS doesn't work).
  This specifies that the oldest LTS version to build for is lts-19.

  The newest LTS to build with stack-all can similarly be configured:
  `stack-all -c -n lts21` or setting `newest = lts-21`.

  ### Running other stack commands
  By default `stack-all` just runs the stack `build` command over
  Stackage major versions.

  You can also specify a stack command to run with options on the commandline:
  eg
  ```
  $ stack-all test --no-rerun-tests
  ```
  will run `stack test` over the LTS versions instead.

  Happy stack building!

  ## Install
  The project is released on Hackage.

  You can also build from git source with `stack install` or `cabal install`.
