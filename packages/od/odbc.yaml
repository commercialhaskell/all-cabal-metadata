  # odbc [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/odbc.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/odbc) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/vpn6a1pme25upbux?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/chrisdone/odbc-0os0b)

  Haskell binding to the ODBC API, with a strong emphasis on stability,
  testing and simplicity.

  ## Platform and database support

  The following database drivers are tested against in CI:

  * Microsoft SQL Server 2017

  The following operating systems are tested against in CI:

  * Windows [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/vpn6a1pme25upbux?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/chrisdone/odbc-0os0b)
  * Linux [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/odbc.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/odbc)

  I develop and test this library on OS X, but currently do not have a
  reliable way to run Microsoft SQL Server on Travis CI.

  ## How ODBC works

  ODBC is a C API that is split into a *manager* and a *driver*.

  On Windows, there is an ODBC manager that comes with the OS. On Linux
  and OS X, the unixODBC package provides the same functionality.

  Separately, for each database type, you have driver packages. When you
  provide a connection string, like this:

  ```
  ODBC_TEST_CONNECTION_STRING='DRIVER={ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server};SERVER=127.0.0.1;Uid=SA;Pwd=Passw0rd;Encrypt=no'
  ```

  The `DRIVER` tells the ODBC API which library to use. In this case,
  it's the recent SQL Server driver provided by Microsoft. Then, ODBC
  functions like `SQLDriverConnectW` will call that library.

  ## How to connect to Microsoft SQL Server

  In recent years, Microsoft has released binary drivers for SQL Server
  for Windows, Linux and OS X, with a guide for each operating
  system. That guide for the latest and greatest official Microsoft
  driver is
  [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/linux-mac/installing-the-microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server).

  You can use the [SQL Server docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-mssql-server) to easily run SQL Server anywhere in a few seconds.

  I have tested the OS X instructions on my own machine.
  [This project's Dockerfile](https://github.com/fpco/odbc/blob/master/Dockerfile)
  follows setup instructions for Linux, and
  [the AppVeyor file](https://github.com/fpco/odbc/blob/master/appveyor.yml)
  follows the setup instructions for Windows.

  There is a test program that comes with the package called `odbc`
  which accepts a connection string as its argument. You can use this to
  test your connection easily.

  (Use `17` instead of `13` if that's the driver you installed.)

      $ stack exec odbc 'DRIVER={ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server};SERVER=192.168.99.101;Uid=SA;Pwd=Passw0rd;Encrypt=no'
      > create table foo (i int)
      Rows: 0
      > insert into foo values (123123123)
      Rows: 0
      > select * from foo
      123123123
      Rows: 1

  ## Check your package is working

  You can spin up a SQL Server in docker and connect to it with the
  trivial binary `odbc` that comes with this package:

  ```
  $ docker run --net=host -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'SA_PASSWORD=Passw0rd' -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-CU8-ubuntu

  ## Common issues


  ### Can't open lib 'ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server'

  If you see an error like this:

      [unixODBC][Driver Manager]Can't open lib 'ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server' : file not found

  Then you might be trying to use the wrong driver. You might have
  installed version `17`, so change the string to `ODBC Driver 17 for
  SQL Server`.

  If it still says this, you might have to configure an odbcinst.ini
  file:

  ``` yaml
  [ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server]
  Driver = <driver_path>
  ```

  In Nix, this might be where <driver_path> is the result of evaluating
  `${nixpkgs.unixODBCDrivers.msodbcsql17}/lib/libmsodbcsql-17.7.so.1.1"`.

  Which would need the following packages available:

  * nixpkgs.freetds
  * nixpklgs.unixODBC
  * nixpkgs.unixODBCDrivers.msodbcsql17

  ### Data source name not found and no default driver specified

  If you see an error like this:

      [unixODBC][Driver Manager]Data source name not found and no default driver specified

  This is a terrible error message. If passing your DSN via a shell
  environment variable or argument, check that your input string isn't
  quoted e.g. `"Driver=.."` instead of `Driver=..` due to silly shell
  scripting quoting issues.

  ## Terminating with uncaught exception of type

  If you see an error like this on OS X with driver version 17,

  ```
  libc++abi.dylib: terminating with uncaught exception of type
  std::runtime_error: collate_byname::collate_byname failed to construct
  for C/en_AU.UTF-8/C/C/C/C
  ```

  use driver 13 or [see here for more detail](https://github.com/fpco/odbc/issues/17).
