description: |-
  Usually you would convert ODS to CSV via @libreoffice --headless@
  but this conflicts with running GUI instances of @libreoffice@
  and requires a full libreoffice installation
  and has incomprehensible CSV export command-line options
  and selection of individual tables is inferior.

  This program quickly scans through a FODS document using a XML parser
  and watches only the necessary data.
  It does not interpret or evaluate the formula data,
  instead it assumes that the contained evaluated values are correct.
  This is true, if the file was saved from LibreOffice
  but might not be true if generated or manipulated by other tools.

  ToDo: Provide FODS parser as library function, maybe in @spreadsheet@.
