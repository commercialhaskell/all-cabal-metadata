changelog: |
  0.3.7.3 (2015-05-30):
      - Moved VERSION to CHANGELOG
  0.3.7 (2013-08-08):
      - System.Posix.IO.ByteString: Corrected a bug in fdSeek/tryFdSeek where the return value was always 0 on largefile i686 systems due to the underlying C function being (undocumentedly) implemented as a macrocall. This had been fixed in unix-2.6.0.1, and I've just backported their fix (replacing the previous unix-2.4.2.0 implementation). Cf:
      * <https://github.com/ghc/packages-base/blob/master/System/Posix/Internals.hs#L414>

description: "unix-bytestring\n===============\n[![Hackage version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/unix-bytestring.svg?style=flat)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unix-bytestring)
  \n[![Build Status](https://github.com/wrengr/unix-bytestring/workflows/ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wrengr/unix-bytestring/actions?query=workflow%3Aci)\n[![Dependencies](https://img.shields.io/hackage-deps/v/unix-bytestring.svg?style=flat)](http://packdeps.haskellers.com/specific?package=unix-bytestring)\n\nUnix/Posix-specific
  functions for `ByteString`s.\n\nThis package provides `ByteString` file-descriptor
  based I/O API,\ndesigned loosely after the `String` file-descriptor based I/O API\nin
  `System.Posix.IO`. The functions here wrap standard C implementations\nof the functions
  specified by the ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990 (“POSIX.1”)\nand X/Open Portability Guide Issue
  4, Version 2 (“XPG4.2”)\nspecifications.\n\nNote that this package doesn't require
  the unix package as a\ndependency. But you'll need it in order to get your hands
  on an\n`Fd`, so we're not offering a complete replacement.\n\n\n## Install\n\nIn
  general, this is a simple package and should be easy to install.\nYou must have
  hsc2hs installed in order to compile the package (but\nthen you probably already
  do). With the cabal-install program you\ncan just do:\n\n    $> cabal install unix-bytestring\n\nOr
  if you don't have cabal-install, then you can use the Cabal library:\n\n    $> runhaskell
  Setup.hs configure\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs build\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs
  test\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs haddock --hyperlink-source\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs
  copy\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs register\n\nThe test step is optional and currently
  does nothing. The Haddock\nstep is also optional.\n\n\n### FFI Problems\n\nThe unix-bytestring
  package uses standard POSIX header files\n`<sys/types.h>`, `<sys/uio.h>`, and `<unistd.h>`.
  If Cabal has\ndifficulty finding these files or reports another error, be sure\nyour
  include path variables are correct. If the problem persists,\ncontact the maintainer.\n\n\n###
  Building for GHC (6.8 and above)\n\nNothing special to mention. \n\n\n### Building
  for Hugs (September 2006)\n\nI haven't actually compiled this for Hugs because I
  don't have a\nnew enough version of Cabal for it, but I don't forsee any difficulties.\nIf
  you do compile this for Hugs, let the maintainer know how it\nwent.\n\nWhen compiling
  for Hugs, see the following bugs for Cabal's interaction\nwith ffihugs. These bugs
  do not currently affect this package, but\nthis notice is here in case they affect
  future versions. For more\ndetails and a minimal regression suite, see:\n\n    <http://community.haskell.org/~wren/cabal-ffihugstest/>\n\n\n(1)
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/ticket/526>\nOptions in hugs-options aren't
  passed through to ffihugs, most\nimportantly -98 and +o are the ones we'd like to
  pass. For enabling\nthe +o flag Hugs-Sept06 does not honor:\n    pragma    {-# LANGUAGE
  OverlappingInstances #-}\n    pragma    {-# OPTIONS_HUGS +o #-}\n    cabal     extensions:
  OverlappingInstances\nAnd the -98 flag has similar issues. Therefore this is a real\nproblem.\n\nImmediate
  solution: The options set in hugs-options should be passed\nto ffihugs as well.
  As of Cabal 1.6 they are not passed (verified\nby Duncan Coutts). The two programs
  accept all the same options,\nso this is valid.\n\nIdeal solution: Based on the
  extensions field, Cabal should\nautomatically determine whether -98 and +o need
  to be enabled (for\nboth hugs and ffihugs).\n\n\n(2) <http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/ticket/527>\nIf
  CPP is being used in conjunction with FFI, then cpp/cpphs is not\ncalled before
  ffihugs is called. Thus, users must pass an -F flag\nto ffihugs in order to declare
  a code filter (and must pass all\ncpp-options to -F manually). For example:\n\n
  \   --ffihugs-option=-F'cpp -P -traditional -D__HUGS__ -D__BLAH__'\n\nThis requires
  duplicating the build specifications, which defeats\nthe point of Cabal. Also it
  leads to tricky issues about ensuring\nthe proper level of quoting/escaping. (e.g.
  using the plural,\n--ffihugs-options=..., breaks it. Wrapping the -F'cpp...' in
  double\nquotes breaks it.)\n\n\n## Links\n\n* [Website](http://cl.indiana.edu/~wren/)\n*
