description: " \n\n# The uniform-strings package \n\nTries to resolve the confusing
  breadth of choices to represent and operate on text in Haskell. It contains \n\n-
  a /principled/ set of conversions between representations for text, namely \n\n
  \   - s - Strings,\n\n    - t - Text,\n\n    - b - ByteString,\n\n    - l - LazyByteString,
  \n\n    - bu - ByteString containing UTF-8 characters,\n\n    - latin - charcters
  with latin1 encoding\n\n    - u - URLencoding, and \n\nconversions functions of
  type `x2y` (e.g. `s2t` for a conversion from String to Text) and methods to circumvent
  the difficulties.\n\n- a set of functions applicable to character strings, which
  have the exact same semantics for all the types (usually the name of the function
  applicable to Strings with an appended \\\"\\'\\\" to avoid name clashes with existing
  code.\n\n- a few infix function for string manipulation. \n\nThis is a package in
  `uniformBase` and other uniform packages will build on it. \n\n\nTo Do:\nThe code
  originated in 2010 to 2018. It will be revised  and the dependencies greatly reduced
  when using `text` and `basement`.\n\n# Intention of \"uniform\" packages\nThe \"uniform\"
  packages are yet another attempt to select a useful subset from the overwhelming
  variety of the Haskell biotop. It was started in the 2010, grew over the years but
  was never packaged and put into Hackage; it is comparable to other similar attempts
  from which it has learned and occasionally copied code. \n\nThe \"uniform\" approach
  is different from some others by:\n- compatible with 'standard' Haskell, i.e. Haskell
  2010 plus extensions as indicated in the modules,\n- use the regular Haskell prelude,\n-
  avoid name clashes as far as possible,\n- combine logically connected operations
  in one place and in a form allowing coordinated use, but \n- broken in small, mostly
  independently building packages.\n\nChoices are:\n- strong preference for total
  functions, achieved often with producing error messages which makes debugging easier
  than the plain failure of partial functions,\n- use monads-tf because TypeFamilies
  seemed to lead to better documentation.\n\nIssues with this approach: it is limited
  by the deeps of understanding of Haskell of the authors and his experience. It shows
  a focus on understanding semantics (and formal ontology) linked to algebra applied
  to practical problems (Geographic Information Systems). \nIt seems that efforts
  to construct coherent subsets of Haskell are limited by the complexity of the task
  -- the more comprehensive an environment should be the more complex is it to learn
  and use. The approach here is what emerged after some 25 years of using Haskell
  to write application oriented code, mostly to demonstrate theories in spatial information
  theory. "
