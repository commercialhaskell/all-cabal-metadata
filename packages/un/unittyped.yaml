description: UnitTyped is a Haskell library that makes it possible to do computations
  on values with a dimension and a unit. The typechecker ensures that all operations
  are using the proper dimensions, and all units can be converted to compatible units
  automatically. New dimensions and units can be defined from other modules, requiring
  just a data type and one class instance to work with everything else. The library
  comes with all SI dimensions and units, and many units derived from those.
