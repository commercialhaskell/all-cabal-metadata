  The goal of this small library is to make it easy to customize handling of uncaught exceptions in Haskell applications.
  The default handler of uncaught exceptions uses the `Show` type class to print the exception.
  However, in some cases you may want to use `displayException` which renders the exception value in a human-friendly manner.
  You can find more details about motivation and implementation of this library in its Haddock documentation and [this blog post](https://serokell.io/blog/uncaught-exception-handling).
