  # unlift-stm

  ### (un)lifted classes and functions for the STM monad

  Lifted and unlifted classes and functions for the STM monad. To get
  started, just:

  ```
  import Control.Concurrent.STM.Unlift
  ```

  This is meant to be a drop-in replacement for [`Control.Concurrent.STM`][STM].

  This package provides functionality for the STM monad, which is highly
  analagous to the functionalty for the IO monad found in
  [`Control.Monad.IO.Class`][MonadIO], [`Control.Monad.IO.Unlift`][MonadUnliftIO],
  and [`UnliftIO.STM`][UnliftIO-STM]:

  - `MonadSTM` is a copy of [`MonadIO`][MonadIO] modified for STM
  - `MonadUnliftSTM` is a copy of [`MonadUnliftIO`][MonadUnliftIO] modified for
    STM
  - Some functions found in `Control.Concurrent.STM.Unlift` are re-exported
    directly from [`UnliftIO.STM`][UnliftIO-STM]
