  This package provides a

  @
  class Unsatisfiable (msg :: TypeError)
  @

  and

  @
  unsatisfiable :: forall msg a. Unsatisfiable msg => a
  @

  combinator.

  There is also a plugin which

  * Pretty-prints @msg@s of /wanted/ @Unsatisfiable@, and
  * Solves all other constraints if there is /given/ @Unsatisfiable@

  The plugin also works with @-fdefer-type-errors@.
