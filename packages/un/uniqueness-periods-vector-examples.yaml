changelog: "# Revision history for uniqueness-periods-vector-examples\n\n## 0.1.0.0
  -- 2020-09-09\n\n* First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n## 0.1.2.0
  -- 2020-09-11\n\n* First version revised B. Changed the dependency boundaries for
  the uniqueness-periods-vector-general package.\n\n## 0.1.3.0 -- 2020-09-12\n\n*
  First version revised C. Changed the dependency boundaries for some changed packages
  from the uniqueness-periods-vector series. Made the needed code changes.\n\n## 0.2.0.0
  -- 2020-09-13\n\n* Second version. Changed the dependency boundaries of the uniqueness-periods-vector-general
  package. Added a new executable uniqVec02.\n\n## 0.3.0.0 -- 2020-09-15\n\n* Third
  version. Added a new executable uniqVec03. It tests a hypothesis that for many Ukrainian
  poems (for example, by Oleksandr Oles) the actual\ndiverse2 output lies close between
  midpoint between the minimum and maximum possible for that line values.\n\n## 0.3.1.0
  -- 2020-09-15\n\n* Third version revised A. Some code improvements for uniqVec03
  executable for filtering non-Ukrainian texts parts that must not be inlined.\n\n##
  0.3.1.1 -- 2020-09-16\n\n* Third version revised B. Changed the order of the output
  information for uniqVec03 executable, used tabutation symbols as delimiter, some
  code improvements.\n\n## 0.4.0.0 -- 2020-09-17\n\n* Fourth version. Added a README.md
  file. Changed the behaviour of the uniqVec03 executable so that it is more accurate
  and gives more output information.\nAdded links to results of the processment for
  the Ukrainian poetic original and translated-into texts.\n\n## 0.5.0.0 -- 2020-09-19\n\n*
  Fifth version. Added more information to the uniqVec03 output. Now it shows additionally
  the matrix of the words-per-line x number-of-the-interval in two different ways
  (the first one is\njust a simple visualization in ASCII). Besides, it counts totals
  on the words-per-line and prints it, added the possibility to change the number
  of the intervals as the second\ncommand line argument, and made some dependency
  changing related changes. Changed the dependency bounds for uniqueness-periods-vector-filters
  package. Added new dependency\nof uniqueness-periods-vector-stats package.\n\n##

  of uniqueness-periods-vector-stats and used function from there in uniqVec03 executable.\n\n##
  0.5.2.0 -- 2020-09-19\n\n* Fifth version revised B. Fixed issue with parse error
  for the uniqVec03 executable in the CPP preprocessor.\n\n## 0.5.3.0 -- 2020-09-20\n\n*
  Fifth version revised C. Fixed issue with parsing empty second command line argument
  (or its absense, actually).\n\n## 0.6.0.0 -- 2020-09-25\n\n* Sixth version. Changed
  dependency boundaries. Added parallel as a new dependency. Switched to parallel
  version of the uniqVec03 program. Added ghc-options section to the uniqVec03 executable.\n\n##

  Seventh version. Changed dependency boundaries. Fixed multiple issues with the uniqVec03
  executable.\nSome comments in the code improvements. Introduced two more command
  line options -- the third and the fourth ones to control whether to print the line
  of\nthe text being analyzed and whether to transform the text into a monolythic
  one-line String before processment respectively.\n\n## 0.7.1.0 -- 2020-09-28\n\n*
  Seventh version revised A. Fixed issue with ambiguous importing for GHC-7.8* series
  in the uniqVec03 executable Main.hs module.\n\n## 0.7.2.0 -- 2020-10-02\n\n* Seventh
  version revised B. Added additional information so that also is displayed the percentages
  of intervals in the uniqVec03 executable. Parallelization\n(and mostly performance)
  optimizations for uniqVec03 executable.\n\n## 0.8.0.0 -- 2020-10-05\n\n* Eigth version.
  Added a new way to compare the results for processment of the uniqVec03 executable.
  Added the fifth command line argument to control this\ncomparisons. Added a new
  lightweight dependency of lists-flines. Changed the names of the executables.\n\nuniqVec01
  -> lineVariants\n\nuniqVec02 -> rewritePoem\n\nuniqVec03 -> processText\n\n## 0.8.0.1
  -- 2020-10-05\n\n* Eigth version revised A. Fixed issue with wrong import statements
  order in the code for processText executable.\n\n## 0.8.0.2 -- 2020-10-05\n\n* Eigth
  version revised B. Fixed issue with Sturges' rule and the respective function in
  the processText executable. For more information, please, see:\nSturges H. (1926).
  The choice of a class-interval. J. Amer. Statist. Assoc., 21, 65-66.\n\n## 0.8.0.3
  -- 2020-10-05\n\n* Eigth version revised C. Fixed issues with README.md file inaccuracies
  and for double import of the mconcat function.\n\n## 0.9.0.0 -- 2020-10-06\n\n*
  Ninth version. Added the sixth command line argument except those ones in RTS for
  the processText executable to control whether if the executable is\nworking in comparative
  mode printing two analyses at a time then to evaluate them in parallel or sequentially.
  The default one is in parallel, but if you\nwould like to use possibly less resources
  then you can evaluate them in sequence. Some minor code improvements.\n\n## 0.9.1.0
  -- 2020-10-06\n\n* Ninth version revised A. Fixed several issues with rewritePoem
  executable related to dependencies issues. Updated the dependencies bounds.\n\n##
  0.10.0.0 -- 2020-10-07\n\n* Tenth version. Changed the behaviour of the lineVariants
  and rewritePoem executables. Now you can introspect the inner structure of the variants
  of the line or for the whole text. Added build dependencies to it (they are already
  included for other executables). Updated the versions because of better printing
  output.\n\n## 0.11.0.0 -- 2020-10-09\n\n* Eleventh version. Switched to the new
  versions of the uniqueness-periods-common and related packages, so that it can be
  more flexible in the future.\nThe breaking change. Please, update the packages to
  the latest version available.\n\n## 0.12.0.0 -- 2020-10-10\n\n* Twelfth version.
  Updated dependencies, switched to the [Float] only versions of the FuncRep and inner
  functions. Introduced a new textual command line\nargument that allows to choose
  which metrices (called \\\"properties\\\") to use from uniqueness-periods-vector-properties
  package. Made a package\ncontaining also two libraries which shares the common functions.\n\n##
  0.12.1.0 -- 2020-10-10\n\n* Twelfth version revised A. Fixed issue with wrongly
  defined control parameters in the lineVariants executable.\n\n## 0.12.2.0 -- 2020-10-12\n\n*
  Twelfth version revised B. Improved printing of the output for the processText executable,
  used for this a new function precChoice.\n\n## 0.12.3.0 -- 2020-10-12\n\n* Twelfth
  version revised C. Improved printing of the output for the processText executable,
  used for this a new function precChoice. Fixed issue with\ndependency function uniquenessVariants2GNP
  that influenced all the related functionality.\n\n## 0.12.3.1 -- 2020-10-14\n\n*
  Twelfth version revised D. Some code improvements.\n\n## 0.13.0.0 -- 2020-10-17\n\n*
  Thirteenth version. Divided the processText executable into two separate executables:
  propertiesText and distributionText (the second one is intended to process\nthe
  output of the first one). For example, on Linux shell :\n\n\tpropertiesText <cmdline
  args> | distributionText <first arg> 1\n\nwill produce the similar behaviour to
  the single passing of the processText in the previous versions. This was made to
  improve performance of the functionality provided\nearlier by the processText executable.\n\n##
  0.13.1.0 -- 2020-10-17\n\n* Thirteenth version revised A. Fixed issue with being
  ambiguous function mconcat for the distributionText executable code. Fixed issue
  with wrong numeration of the\ncommand line arguments in the propertiesText executable
  code.\n\n## 0.14.0.0 -- 2020-10-30\n\n* Fourteenth version. Moved some modules and
  a code for the executable distributionText to the other package that is planned
  to share its functionality with less dependencies.\nFixed issue with being not reavaluated
  in the code for the rewritePoem executable in the circle2I function that led to
  incorrect results. Updated the dependencies boundaries.\n\n## 0.14.1.0 -- 2020-10-30\n\n*
  Fourteenth version revised A. Fixed issue with being not compiled on the GHC-7.8*
  series because of (trivial) ambiguity. Some code improvements for propertiesText
  executable.\nSome documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.14.2.0 -- 2020-11-09\n\n*
  Fourteenth version revised B. Fixed issue with the wrong output option for one of
  the columns of the propertiesText running output. Changed the\ndependency boundaries
  so that now it uses latest variants. Please, consider switching to the phonetic-languages-examples
  package instead because\nit provides the analogous functionality and shows better
  performance. This one is left for comparison purposes.\n\n## 0.14.3.0 -- 2020-11-10\n\n*
  Fourteenth version revised C. Fixed issue with the reverse order of the output for
  the rewritePoem executable.\n\n## 0.14.4.0 -- 2020-11-11\n\n* Fourteenth version
  revised D. Fixed issue with being not compiled on the GHC-7.8* series because of
  not importing mappend in the module header.\n"
