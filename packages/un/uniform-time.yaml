description: "A unifified manipulation of time and date representations.\n\nUniform
  means:\n- same functions with identical semantics independent of representation\n-
  all functions are total (or become so using Maybe or Either)\n\nConversions from
  `EpochTime` to `UTCTime` and then to `YMD` and similar semantic structures. "
