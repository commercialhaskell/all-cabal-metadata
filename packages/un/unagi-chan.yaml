synopsis: Fast concurrent queues with a Chan-like API, and more
changelog: "### 0.1.1.0\n\n- support new criterion and GHC 7.8.3\n- small performance
  improvement to boxed unagi\n\n### 0.2.0.0\n\n- implement a bounded variant (See
  issue #1)\n- address issue with stale tickets when running in GHCi\n\n### 0.2.0.1\n\n-
  conditionally use tryReadMVar (as before) when GHC >= 7.8.3\n- set proper CPP flags
  when running tests\n\n### 0.3.0.0\n\n- fixed build on GHC 7.6 (thanks @Noeda)\n-
  `Unagi.Unboxed` is now polymorphic in a new `UnagiPrim` class, which permits an
  optimization; defined instances are the same\n- add new NoBlocking variants with
  reads that don't block, omiting some overhead\n    - these have a new `Stream` interface
  for reads with even lower overhead\n- revisited memory barriers in light of https://github.com/rrnewton/haskell-lockfree/issues/39,
  and document them better\n- Added `tryReadChan` functions to all variants\n- get
  rid of upper bounds on `atomic-primops`\n\n### 0.3.0.1\n\n- fix upper bounds on
  atomic-primops again (made as revision to cabal metadata for 0.3.0.0\n- fix some
  docs\n\n### 0.3.0.2\n\n- re-bump atomic-primops version; should now support 7.10\n-
  fix missing other-modules for test suite\n- fix getChanContents for GHC 7.10 (see
  GHC Trac #9965) \n\n### 0.4.0.0\n\n- `tryReadChan` now returns an `(Element a, IO
  a)` tuple, where the `snd` is a blocking read action \n- depend atomic-primops >=
  0.8\n\n### 0.4.1.0\n\n- add non-atomic `estimatedLength`, thanks to danclien\n"

description: |
  This library provides implementations of concurrent FIFO queues (for both
  general boxed and primitive unboxed values) that are fast, perform well
  under contention, and offer a Chan-like interface. The library may be of
  limited usefulness outside of x86 architectures where the fetch-and-add
  instruction is not available.

  We export several variations of our design; some support additional
  functionality while others try for lower latency by removing features or
  making them more restrictive (e.g. in the @Unboxed@ variants).

  - @Unagi@: a general-purpose near drop-in replacement for @Chan@.

  - @Unagi.Unboxed@: like @Unagi@ but specialized for primitive types; this
  may perform better if a queue grows very large.

  - @Unagi.Bounded@: a bounded variant with blocking and non-blocking writes,
  and other functionality where a notion of the queue's capacity is
  required.

  - @Unagi.NoBlocking@: lowest latency implementations for when blocking
  reads aren't required.

  - @Unagi.NoBlocking.Unboxed@: like @Unagi.NoBlocking@ but for primitive
  types.

  Some of these may be deprecated in the future if they are found to provide
  little performance benefit, or no unique features; you should benchmark and
  experiment with them for your use cases, and please submit pull requests
  for additions to the benchmark suite that reflect what you find.

  Here is an example benchmark measuring the time taken to concurrently write
  and read 100,000 messages, with work divided amongst increasing number of
  readers and writers, comparing against the top-performing queues in the
  standard libraries. The inset graph shows a zoomed-in view on the
  implementations here.
