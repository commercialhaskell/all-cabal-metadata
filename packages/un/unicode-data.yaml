  # README

  `unicode-data` provides Haskell APIs to efficiently access the unicode
  character database. Performance is the primary goal in the design of
  this package.

  The Haskell data structures are generated programmatically from the
  unicode character database (UCD) files.  The latest unicode version
  supported by this library is 13.0.0.

  This package is far from complete. Currently it supports normalization
  related functions and a few other properties, primarily to support
  `unicode-transforms` package. More properties can be added as needed by
  any other packages or use cases.

  Please see the haddock documentation for reference documentation.

  ## Unicode database version update

  To update the unicode version please update the version number in
  `ucd.sh`.

  To download the unicode database, run `ucd.sh download` from the top
  level directory of the repo to fetch the database in `./ucd`.

  ```
  $ ./ucd.sh download
  ```

  To generate the Haskell data structure files from the downloaded database
  files, run `ucd.sh generate` from the top level directory of the repo.

  ```
  $ ./ucd.sh generate
  ```

  ## Running property doctests

  Temporarily add `QuickCheck` to build depends of library.

  ```
  $ cabal build
  $ cabal-docspec --check-properties --property-variables c
  ```
