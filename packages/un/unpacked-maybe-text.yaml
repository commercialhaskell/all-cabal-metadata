description: |-
  This library provides a specialization of `Maybe ShortText`.
  When this is an unpacked field of data constructor, this will
  result in fewer indirections and fewer allocations. This is
  a micro-optimization, so think hard about whether or not this
  will improve performance in a particular situation. A different
  way to accomplish a similar goal is to forbid empty text and then
  use the empty text value as a placeholder that signifies `Nothing`.
  This alternative may or may not be an option depending on whether
  or not the empty string is valid in your problem domain.
