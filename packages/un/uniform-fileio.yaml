description: "Uniform methods to access data in files.\n\nGoals:\n\n- same functions
  with identical semantics independent of representation\n\n- all functions are total
  (or become so using `Maybe` or `Either`)\n\n- performance is NOT a goal - once the
  program logic is confirmed and tested, performance improvements can be achieved
  based on observations. The goal for \"uniform\" is reducing the complexity for the
  designer of a program - performance improvement come when the logic is correct.
  \n\nSpecifically:\n\n- a file path can be given as `Filepath` (which is a string)
  or as a `Path`, which different types for directories and files and for absolute
  and relative path, to reduce confusing.\n\n- functions to work on file path independent
  of representation\n\n- functions to access file with either type of path representation\n\n-
  operations are total; failures of file operations are signaled by ErrorT or Either
  returns.\n\nExperimentally:\n\n- `TypedFile.hs` tries to extend a type concept from
  the representation in memory to a representation on file (indicated by the file
  extension). It proposes a set of functions to read structured files into structured
  data - selected by the extensions."
