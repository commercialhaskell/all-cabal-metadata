description: "Uniform approach to use JSON and YAML\n\nTo use JSON and YAML in Haskell
  - connecting to other tools which expects input or produce output in those formats
  - is a challenge.\nA set of functions which were used in a few projects - some connected
  to `pandoc` - are here collected and arranged to work in the uniform style (use
  ErrIO, `text`).  "
