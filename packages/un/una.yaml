  # una: Universal un-archiver

  Version 1.0, by John Wiegley <johnw@newartisans.com>

  This is a "universal", recursive unarchiver, written because I'm too lazy to
  remember all the extraction options for the large number of archive formats I
  deal with.

  Optional dependencies:

  - StuffIt Expander (free, expander-only version)
  - MacPorts: unarj, unrar, lha, p7zip, cabextract

  ## Usage

      una [OPTION] ARCHIVE...

      If no OPTION is specified, the default action is to extract the archive's
      contents into the current directory.

      Options:
        -h, --help        show help
        -d, --delete      delete the archive if sucessfully extracted
        -f, --overwrite   overwrite any existing file

  This script is also smart about unarchiving:

    a) if all the contents of an archive would already extract into a single
       directory, do that;

    b) if the archive contains only one item, extract it into the current
       directory;

    c) otherwise, if the archive would dump multiple contents into the current
       directory, create a new directory based on the name of the archive,
       sans extension, and put everything there.
