changelog: |
  1.2.2
  * Add Solo instances

  1.2.1
  * Explicitly mark modules as Safe or Trustworthy

  1.2
  * Use universe-some-1.2, which uses a Some-type from the some-package.

  1.1.1
  * Add `Predicate` and `Op` instances

  1.1
  * Add `cardinality :: Tagged a Natural` to Finite
  * Re-arrange packages, ghc boot instances are in `universe-base`
  * Rearranged the elements in `universe :: [Rational]` to reduce allocation and increase speed.
  * Add `Data.Universe.Generic`
  * New package `universe-dependent-sum`

  1.0
  * split package into small pieces:
  * six packages, all dependencies of a top-level "universe" package
  * a base installation requires many fewer dependencies
  * moved Data.Universe.Instances to D.U.I.Base for consistency
  * modules export the classes that they export instances of
