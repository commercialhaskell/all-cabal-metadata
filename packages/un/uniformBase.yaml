description: "# UniformBase\n\nThe package imports separately compilable and usable
  packages. This package and all its parts are self-contained and need no further
  imports; no need to import the subpackages individually.\n\nThe package depends
  indirectly on many often used packages but some concentration is planned in the
  future, using other attemps with similar goals. \n\nlibraries required:\n\n- for
  uniform-strings\n    debian: apt install libicu-dev\n\n "
