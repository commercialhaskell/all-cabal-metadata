  # Revision history for uniqueness-periods-vector-stats

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2020-09-19

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  ## 0.1.1.0 -- 2020-09-19

  * First version revised A. Fixed issues with not importing from GHC.Prim fabsFloat# for GHC lower than 8.2* versions. Removed functions that used Neumaier summation because
  they do not have the intended behaviour.

  ## 0.1.2.0 -- 2020-09-19

  * First version revised B. Removed the functions that compute mean with dispersion using unlifted types, because of numeric inaccuracy.

  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2020-12-05

  * Second version. Some documentation improvements because of the similar code snippets found in the various
  previous publications by the other authors. Added new functions and rewrite the existing ones.

  ## 0.2.1.0 -- 2020-12-05

  * Second version revised A. Fixed issue with being wrongly defined for the meanD and meanF functions.

  ## 0.2.2.0 -- 2022-03-24

  * Second version revised B. Updated the dependency boundaries to support the latest GHC and Cabal versions.

  ## 0.3.0.0 -- 2022-05-31

  * Third version. Fixed issues with population and sample dispersion evaluation, added for this new functions.
