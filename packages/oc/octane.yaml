  # [Octane][]

  [![Version badge][]][version]
  [![Windows build badge][]][windows build]
  [![Build badge][]][build]

  Octane is the premier [Rocket League][] replay parser. [Rocket League
  Replays][] parses tens of thousands of replays with it. Octane parses most
  replays in less than 5 seconds. It outputs easy-to-read JSON.

  That being said, Octane is not actively developed anymore. Consider using
  [Rattletrap][] (which is actively developed) instead. Rattletrap can also
  generate replay files from JSON, which Octane cannot do.

  Octane has a command-line interface. To get it, download and unpack [the latest
  release][] for your platform. You can run the executable one of three ways:

  1.  Pipe a replay file into it. It will output a compact JSON object to
      standard out.

      ``` sh
      $ octane < a.replay > replay.json
      ```

  2.  Pass it a path to a replay file. Both file paths and URLs work. It will
      output a compact JSON object to standard out.

      ``` sh
      $ octane a.replay > replay.json
      $ octane https://media.rocketleaguereplays.com/uploads/replay_files/9A06783F4FEA7AFF3D8298A3E5A412F5.replay > replay.json
      ```

  3.  Pass it several paths to replay files. Both file paths and URLs work. It
      will output a compact JSON array of objects to standard out.

      ``` sh
      $ octane first.replay second.replay > replays.json
      ```

  Rocket League saves your replays in a folder that depends on your operating
  system.

  - Windows: `%UserProfile%\Documents\My Games\Rocket League\TAGame\Demos`
  - macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Rocket League/TAGame/Demos`
  - Linux: `$HOME/.local/share/Rocket League/TAGame/Demos`

  Octane is written in Haskell. If you're looking for a library written in
  another language, check out the [Rocket League Replays wiki][]. It has links to
  many other Rocket League replay parsers.
