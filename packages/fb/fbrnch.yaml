  A tool to help Fedora Packagers build package branches and add new packages.

  Fedora developers use a lot of time building packages across releases
  and workflow for adding new packages, etc.
  fbrnch was made to help (semi-)automate common workflows to save time
  and effort.

  fbrnch is distributed under the GPL license version 2 or later.

  ## Description
  `fbrnch` is a Fedora Packager client which tries to automate some common tasks
  like:

  - merging and building a package across release branches
  - automated parallel builds of sets of packages in dependency order
  - creating, updating and listing package reviews
  - requesting new repos and branches
  - importing new packages and updating packages
  - progressive copr builds
  - rename master branches to rawhide

  and more.

  ## Usage

  ### Creating new packages/branches

  #### Creating a new package
  ```
  $ fbrnch create-review [my-new-package]
  ```
  This will create (or update) an srpm, run rpmlint,
  then upload it to fedorapeople, perform a scratch build,
  and open a Review Request in Bugzilla (similar to fedora-create-review).

  #### Update a package review
  ```
  $ fbrnch update-review [my-new-package]
  ```
  Similar to create-review: it uploads the updated files to fedorapeople
  and posts the updated package urls to the open package review.

  #### List open package reviews
  To list one's open package reviews:
  ```
  $ fbrnch reviews
  ```
  They can be filtered by status with various options like
  `--approved` or `--created`.

  One can also search for the review(s) of a specific package with:
  ```
  $ fbrnch find-review package-name
  ```

  #### Request repos
  Once a review has been approved
  ```
  $ fbrnch request-repos
  ```
  will request repos for approved package(s) and offer to request branches.

  #### Import a new package
  After the repo has been created
  ```
  $ fbrnch import
  ```
  will clone the repo and offer to import the srpm
  directly from the latest url in the approved package review,
  which can then be built directly into Koji Rawhide
  and the package review is updated.

  #### Request branches
  If you prefer you can request branches after the repo is created
  or package imported with
  ```
  $ fbrnch request-branches
  ```
  which will be prompt for which branches you want, unless already given.

  Optionally a mock build per branch can be done first.


  ### Cloning and switching branch
  Clone one or more packages:
  ```
  $ fbrnch clone package ...
  ```
  There are also options to clone all one's packages or another user's packages.

  One can change the branch of one or more packages:
  ```
  $ fbrnch switch f36 [package] ...
  ```

  You can also git pull over packages:
  ```
  $ fbrnch pull [package] ...
  ```

  ### List packages and branches
  You can list packages in dist-git pagure with
  ```
  $ fbrnch list PATTERN
  ```
  with globbing.

  Branches of a package can be listed:
  ```
  $ fbrnch branches -B [package] ...
  ```
  You can use the `--remote` option if you don't have the package checked out.

  ### Package status
  ```
  $ fbrnch status -B [package]
  ```
  outputs information about the status of each branch.
  The status command can also be used with `--reviews`
  to check the build status of new packages.

  You can output package's nvr's from local git:
  ```
  $ fbrnch nvr -B [package]
  ```

  and list package bugs:
  ```
  $ fbrnch bugs [package]
  ```

  ### Commit, Merging and Building in Koji
  You can commit to the current branch:
  ```
  $ fbrnch commit
  ```
  It uses any rpm changelog, or you can pass `-m "..."` or amend with `-a`.

  You can merge branches with:
  ```
  $ fbrnch merge f35 package
  ```
  which will offer to merge f36 (or some of it) into f35.

  Merging can also be done together with building:
  ```
  $ fbrnch build f36 package
  ```
  will ask if you want to merge newer commits from a newer branch,
  then push and build it.

  If the branch is also already pushed and NVR built it will be skipped.
  Branch builds are pushed to Bodhi.

  You can also build all branches:
  ```
  $ fbrnch build -B package
  ```
  or all fedora branches:
  ```
  $ fbrnch build -F package
  ```
  or all epel branches:
  ```
  $ fbrnch build -E package
  ```

  Scratch builds can also be done:
  ```
  $ fbrnch scratch rawhide
  ```
  optionally a different koji `--target` can be given.

  You can sort packages by build dependency order:
  ```
  $ fbrnch sort rawhide package1 package2 package3 package4 ...
  ```

  ### Local commands
  ```
  $ fbrnch prep rawhide package
  ```

  Build locally:
  ```
  $ fbrnch local
  ```
  this works in the current package dir like other commands,
  installing any missing dependencies with `sudo dnf builddep`.

  Or one can specify the path to the package.

  Locally build and install:
  ```
  $ fbrnch install package1 package2 package3 ...
  ```

  You can use:
  ```
  $ fbrnch install-deps [package]
  ```
  to only install the dependencies of a package.

  Use
  ```
  $ fbrnch rename-master [package]
  ```
  to rename an old master branch locally to rawhide.

  ### Parallel building
  fbrnch can sort packages automatically and build them in parallel
  in Koji in dependency layers (using low-priority background builds
  to avoid grabbing too many Koji resources).

  ```
  $ fbrnch parallel --sidetag rawhide pkg-x pkg-y pkg-z pkg-xy pkg-xy-z
  ```
  generates a sidetag and builds a list of packages there
  in parallel ordered by build dependencies.

  Except for rawhide using a sidetag is required,
  so you need to manage and select them
  if using more than one per branch with `--target`.

  ### Other commands
  There are more commands like `copr` and `graph`.

  ```
  $ fbrnch --version

  ## Installation
  fbrnch is packaged in Fedora: `sudo dnf install fbrnch`.

  ## Build from source
  1. Install openssl-devel

  2. Clone the git repo.

  3. Then either:

  a) using stack >= 2.1: `stack install`

  or

  b) with cabal-install (probably 2.4 or later) and cabal-rpm:

  ```
  $ cabal-rpm builddep
  $ cabal new-install --installdir=~/bin
  ```

  ## Required runtime tools
  fbrnch currently uses these fedora cli tools:
  - fedpkg
  - bodhi
  - koji
  - copr-cli
  for pushing packages.

  It also makes use of:
  - curl
  - rpmbuild & rpmspec
  - klist and fkinit
  - git
  - ssh & scp (for uploading package reviews)
  - bugzilla API key

  ## Bugzilla API key
  fbrnch can share the API of the python-bugzilla CLI tool,
  placed either in `~/.config/python-bugzilla/bugzillarc` or `~/.bugzillarc`:

  ```
  [bugzilla.redhat.com]
  api_key = PASTE_YOUR_APIKEY_HERE

  ```

  You can create your key at
  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/userprefs.cgi?tab=apikey>.

  ## Known issues
  - parallel builds will push local package commits without asking
  - currently it only checks if already built by NVR not githash
  - authentication is not implemented yet natively for Koji, Bodhi, Pagure
    (and source upload)
    - so python clients are used for "writing"
      (specifically koji, bodhi-client, fedpkg),
      but all queries are done directly by Web APIs for speed and control.
  - https checkouts are currently assumed to an anonymous git checkouts

  ## Motivation, history, talks
  This project started off (as "fedbrnch") basically as a simple tool to
  build a package across branches (ie for current releases).  Then bugzilla
  and Bodhi integration was added, and gradually more features, including
  some generic commands across packages which had already been done before
  in fedora-haskell-tools.

  I have given a couple of short talks about fbranch:
  - Nest with Fedora: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40kTBsA674U) and [slides](https://github.com/juhp/presentations/blob/master/fedora-nest-2020-fbrnch/fbrnch-nest.md)
  - Lightning talk at devconf.cz 2021: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2-6rDuPMRA&t=2s)
