description: "# ``finitary``\r\n\r\n## What's all this about?\r\n\r\n``finitary``
  allows us to specify that a type is _finite_ (that is, contains\r\nfinitely many
  inhabitants which are not ``_|_``), and have confirmation of this\r\nfact by GHC.
  Additionally, it offers a ``Generics``-based auto-derivation\r\ninterface for this,
  as well as multiple helper functions that are enabled by all\r\nthis machinery.\r\n\r\n###
  Why is this a big deal?\r\n\r\nConsider ``Enum``. It's not difficult to see that
  ``Enum`` has issues:\r\n\r\n#### It's partial all over the place\r\n\r\nWhat will
  this code do?\r\n\r\n```haskell\r\ntoEnum 3 :: Bool\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe answer is
  'a runtime error'. How about this?\r\n\r\n```haskell\r\nsucc True\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe
  answer, again, is 'a runtime error'. Many of the methods provided by ``Enum``\r\nare
  partial like this, because many types that happen to be ``Enum`` instances\r\nhave
  cardinalities (much) smaller than ``Int``, which necessitates leaving some\r\n``Int``
  values 'out'.\r\n\r\nThe converse is not much better: on some platforms, ``Int``
  has _smaller_\r\ncardinality than some types with ``Enum`` instances in ``base``.
  For example, on \r\na platform where ``Int`` is 32 bits wide, the ``Word64`` instance
  will definitely \r\ncause problems, as it's 'too big'.\r\n\r\n#### It gives us almost
  no information\r\n\r\nAn ``Enum`` instance says that a type can be munged to and
  from an ``Int``...\r\nsomehow. While ``base`` and the Haskell Report certainly provide
  some limits \r\non its behaviour, a lot of questions remain unanswered, including:\r\n\r\n*
  How many inhabitants does this type have?\r\n* What are the 'safe' values of ``Int``
  I can feed to ``toEnum``?\r\n* For any ``x``, is ``toEnum . (+ 1) . fromEnum $ x``
  safe (in that it'll give\r\n  us a value instead of blowing up)?\r\n\r\n#### We
  don't have a (default) way to auto-derive it\r\n\r\nQuoting ``base``:\r\n\r\n> Instances
  of ``Enum`` may be derived for any enumeration type (types whose\r\n> constructors
  have no fields).\r\n\r\nBut what if your type has fields, especially when they're
  instances of ``Enum``? \r\nUnfortunately, no auto-derivation for you. While this
  stance makes some sense, \r\nit's still rather inconvenient.\r\n\r\n## OK, so what
  are you offering instead?\r\n\r\nThe core of ``finitary`` is the ``Finitary`` type
  class. If we have an instance\r\nof ``Finitary`` for some type ``a``, we have a
  witness to an isomorphism between\r\n``a`` and some ``(KnownNat n) => Finite n``.
  More precisely, we (together with GHC)\r\nknow:\r\n\r\n* That ``a`` has finitely-many
  non-``_|_`` inhabitants\r\n* The value of ``n``, which is the _cardinality_ of ``a``
  (how many inhabitants we have exactly)\r\n* Two functions to 'witness' the isomorphism,
  namely ``fromFinite :: Finite n ->\r\n  a`` and ``toFinite :: a -> Finite n``\r\n\r\n###
  How does ``Finitary`` solve the issues behind ``Enum``?\r\n\r\n#### Everything is
  total, forever\r\n\r\nThere is no way to call ``fromFinite`` or ``toFinite`` with
  an 'inappropriate'\r\nargument. We always know - if you give me a ``Finite n``,
  I will give you back a\r\n(unique) ``a``, guaranteed.\r\n\r\n#### We learn a lot
  from a type having a ``Finitary`` instance\r\n\r\nAside from cardinality, we also
  inherently get the ability to:\r\n\r\n* Have a 'starting' and 'ending' value (assuming
  the cardinality of the type\r\n  isn't zero); and\r\n* Get the 'next' or 'previous'
  value, or report that it doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nAll of this is safe, total and can
  be relied upon. Check out the documentation\r\nfor more details - all of this functionality
  is provided. We also have functions\r\nto help enumerate values of ``Finitary``
  types.\r\n\r\n#### But what about auto-derivation?\r\n\r\nWe have you covered. If
  you want to auto-derive an instance of\r\n``Finitary`` for your type, you absolutely
  can, using the power of\r\n``GHC.Generics``:\r\n\r\n```haskell\r\n{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds
  #-}\r\n{-# LANGUAGE DeriveAnyClass #-}\r\n{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}\r\n{-#
  LANGUAGE DerivingStrategies #-}\r\n\r\nimport Data.Finitary (Finitary)\r\nimport
  Data.Vector.Sized (Vector)\r\nimport Data.Word (Word8)\r\nimport GHC.Generics (Generic)\r\n\r\ndata
  Foo = Bar | Baz (Word8, Word8) | Quux (Vector 4 Bool)\r\n  deriving stock (Eq, Generic)\r\n
  \ deriving anyclass (Finitary) \r\n```\r\n\r\nFurthermore, GHC will even calculate
  the cardinality for you. To assist in this,\r\nwe have provided as many instances
  of ``Finitary`` for 'base' types as possible - \r\nsee the documentation for full
  details.\r\n\r\n### That all seems rather cool - what else can I do with this?\r\n\r\nKnowing
  that a type has finite cardinality is usable for many things - all of\r\nwhich we
  plan to provide. Some examples (with links once we have working, tested\r\ncode)
  include:\r\n\r\n* [Automatic derivation of instances][1]\r\n* Type-safe refinement\r\n*
  Random generation and stream sampling\r\n* Efficient sets, allowing operations like
  complements and a ``Monoid`` under\r\n  intersection\r\n* Efficient maps\r\n* Various
  clever ``lens`` tricks\r\n\r\nIf there's something else interesting you think can
  be done with this, let us\r\nknow: it might make it onto this list, and into code.\r\n\r\n##
  What will this work on?\r\n\r\nCurrently, we support GHC versions ranging from 8.6
  to 9.0.\r\n\r\nThe library has been tested on x86_64, GNU/Linux and Windows.\r\nIf
  you have results on other platforms or architectures, please let us know too!\r\n\r\n##
