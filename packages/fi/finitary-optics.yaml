description: "# ``finitary-optics``\n\n## What's this all about, then?\n\nIf a type
  has an instance of ``Finitary``, we know the type's cardinality ``n``, and\ncan
  convert any (non-bottom) inhabitant to a value of ``Finite n``. We can use\nthis
  to inter-convert between these types. This can sometimes be useful.\n\nThis library
  provides some optics (specifically a ``Prism`` and an ``Iso``)\nwhich help us do
  this kind of conversion more conveniently. \n\n## Sounds good! Can I use it?\n\nWe've
  tested this library on GHCs 8.6.5, 8.8.3 and 8.10.1, on GNU/Linux x86_64.\nIf you
  use this library on any other platforms, let us know how it goes -\nespecially if
  something breaks!\n\n## License\n\nThis library is under the GNU General Public
  License, version 3 or later (SPDX\ncode ``GPL-3.0-or-later``). For more details,
