description: |-
  Implementation of arithmetic in finite fields (prime fields
  and fields of prime power order). Finite fields are
  ubiquitous in algebraic geometry, number theory and cryptography.
  For now the focus is on relatively small fields,
  but algorithms for big fields (required in cryptography)
  may be added later.
