  The `filepath` package provides functionality for manipulating `FilePath` values,
  and is shipped with both [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) and the [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/).
  It provides three modules:


  * [`System.FilePath.Posix`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/filepath/docs/System-FilePath-Posix.html)
  manipulates POSIX/Linux style `FilePath` values (with `/` as the path separator).

  * [`System.FilePath.Windows`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/filepath/docs/System-FilePath-Windows.html)
  manipulates Windows style `FilePath` values (with either `\` or `/` as the path
  separator, and deals with drives).

  * [`System.FilePath`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/filepath/docs/System-FilePath.html)
  is an alias for the module appropriate to your platform.


  All three modules provide the same API, and the same documentation (calling out
  differences in the different variants).


  ### Should `FilePath` be an abstract data type?


  The answer for this library is "no". While an abstract `FilePath` has some advantages
  (mostly type safety), it also has some disadvantages:


  * In Haskell the definition is `type FilePath = String`, and all file-oriented functions
  operate on this type alias, e.g. `readFile`/`writeFile`. Any abstract type would
  require wrappers for these functions or lots of casts between `String` and the abstraction.

  * It is not immediately obvious what a `FilePath` is, and what is just a pure `String`.
  For example, `/path/file.ext` is a `FilePath`. Is `/`? `/path`? `path`? `file.ext`?
  `.ext`? `file`?

  * Often it is useful to represent invalid files, e.g. `/foo/*.txt` probably isn''t
  an actual file, but a glob pattern. Other programs use `foo//bar` for globs, which
  is definitely not a file, but might want to be stored as a `FilePath`.

  * Some programs use syntactic non-semantic details of the `FilePath` to change their
  behaviour. For example, `foo`, `foo/` and `foo/.` are all similar, and refer to
  the same location on disk, but may behave differently when passed to command-line
  tools.

  * A useful step to introducing an abstract `FilePath` is to reduce the amount of
  manipulating `FilePath` values like lists. This library hopes to help in that effort.


  ### Developer notes


  Most of the code is in `System/FilePath/Internal.hs` which is `#include`''d into
  both `System/FilePath/Posix.hs` and `System/FilePath/Windows.hs` with the `IS_WINDOWS`
  CPP define set to either `True` or `False`. This Internal module is a bit weird
  in that it isn''t really a Haskell module, but is more an include file.


  The library has extensive doc tests. Anything starting with `-- >` is transformed
  into a doc test as a predicate that must evaluate to `True`. These tests follow
  a few rules:


  * Tests prefixed with `Windows:` or `Posix:` are only tested against that specific
  implementation - otherwise tests are run against both implementations.

  * Any single letter variable, e.g. `x`, is considered universal quantification,
  and is checked with `QuickCheck`.

  * If `Valid x =>` appears at the start of a doc test, that means the property will
  only be tested with `x` passing the `isValid` predicate.


  The tests can be generated by `Generate.hs` in the root of the repo, and will be
  placed in `tests/TestGen.hs`. The `TestGen.hs` file is checked into the repo, and
  the CI scripts check that `TestGen.hs` is in sync with what would be generated a
  fresh - if you don''t regenerate `TestGen.hs` the CI will fail.


  The `.ghci` file is set up to allow you to type `ghci` to open the library, then
  `:go` will regenerate the tests and run them.
