description: "# ``finitary-derive``\n\n## What's this all about, then?\n\nHave you
  ever written an ``Unbox`` instance for a user-defined type? I hope not,\nbecause
  it's a [uniquely tedious chore][1]. If your type is more complex, this\ncan be difficult,
  fiddly, and frustrating. ``Storable`` is not much better. This\nis the kind of 'work'
  that we as Haskellers ought not to put up with.\n\nNow, you don't have to! As long
  as your type is [``Finitary``][2], you can now\nget ``Unbox`` and ``Storable`` (as
  well as a whole bunch of other) instances \n_almost_ automagically:\n\n```haskell\n{-#
  LANGUAGE DeriveAnyClass #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE DerivingVia
  #-}\n\nimport Data.Finitary\nimport Data.Finitary.Finiteness\nimport Data.Finitary.PackInto\nimport
  Data.Word\nimport Data.Hashable\n\nimport qualified Data.Vector.Unboxed as VU\nimport
  qualified Data.Vector.Storable as VS\n\ndata Foo = Bar | Baz (Word8, Word8) | Quux
  Word16\n  deriving (Eq, Generic, Finitary)\n  deriving (Ord, Bounded, Hashable,
  NFData, Binary) via (Finiteness Foo)\n\nsomeVector :: VU.Vector (PackInto Foo Word64)\nsomeVector
  = VU.fromList . fmap Packed $ [Bar, Baz 0x0 0xf, Quux 0x134]\n\nsomeStorableVector
  :: VS.Vector (PackInto Foo Word64)\nsomeStorableVector = VS.fromList . fmap Packed
  $ [Bar, Baz 0x0 0xf, Quux 0x134]\n```\n\nIf you don't have access to ``DerivingVia``,
  you can still get the benefits of\nthis library -- just use ``Finitary a`` instead
  of ``a``. As it is a ``newtype``, \nyou can ``coerce`` through it if you care about
  efficiency.\n\n## What's the deal with ``Unbox`` and ``Storable`` exactly? What's
  with all the ``Pack`` types?\n\nEssentially, being ``Finitary`` means that there's
  a finite set of indexes, one\nfor each inhabitant. That means we can essentially
  represent any inhabitant as a\nfixed-length number. It's on the basis of this that
  we can 'magic up'\n``Storable`` and ``Unbox``.\n\nHowever, how we _represent_ this
  fixed-length number isn't immediately obvious.\nWe have a couple of options:\n\n-
  A string of bits\n- A string of bytes\n- An array of machine words\n\nAdditionally,
  if we have _another_ finitary type whose cardinality is not\nsmaller, we could potentially
  'borrow' its instances as well. Which of these\nchoices is appropriate isn't obvious
  in general: it depends on whether you care\nabout space or speed, the cardinality
  of the type, and a bunch of other things\ntoo. As we believe that the best people
  to judge tradeoffs like these are the\npeople using our library, we provide _all_
  of these options for you to choose\nfrom, so that you can choose the one that best
  suits you.\n\n## So... what's the difference exactly?\n\n``PackBits`` represents
  indexes as strings of bits. This is the most compact\nrepresentation possible (honestly,
  [maths says so][6]), but the least efficient, \nas accessing individual bits is
  slower on most architectures than whole bytes or words.\nUnless you've got large
  ``Vector``s, you probably don't need this encoding, but\nif space is at an absolute
  premium, this is the best choice. \n\n``PackBytes`` instead represents indexes as
  byte strings. This is a more\nefficient choice than a string of bits, but can still
  be slow for architectures\nwhich prefer whole-word access. It's also fairly compact,
  especially if your\narchitecture has big ``Word``s.\n\n``PackWords`` represents
  indexes as fixed-length arrays of ``Word``s. This is\nthe most efficient encoding
  from the point of view of random reads and writes,\nbut will likely waste a lot
  of space, unless your type is _extremely_ large (as\nin, multiple copies of ``Word``
  large).  \n\nLastly, ``PackInto`` lets you choose another finitary type whose instances
  you\nwant to 'borrow', and will use that type as a representation. This is the most\nflexible,
  and should be preferred whenever possible. However, it requires that a\ntype of
  appropriate cardinality (at least as big as the one you want to encode)\nexists,
  and has the appropriate instances. \n\n## Why can't I ``DerivingVia`` through these
  ``Pack`` types?\n\nFor ``Unbox``, the short answer is 'role restrictions on unboxed
  vectors'. If\nyou want a more detailed explanation, check out the [GHC wiki on roles][3],
  as\nwell as the [implementation of ``Data.Vector.Unboxed``][4]. You might also want\nto
  check out [stuff about data families][5]. \n\nAdditionally, there is some tension
  in the design. We could have made one of two\nchoices: either define ``Pack`` types
  as transparent ``newtype``s, and encode or\ndecode whenever a type class method
  required it; or define ``Pack`` types as\nopaque, and encode or decode only when
  the values were constructed or\ndeconstructed. Ultimately, we went with the second
  option, as it makes the\noccurences of encodes and decodes explicit to the user.
  Had we gone with the\nfirst choice, it would be unclear where encodes and decodes
  occur, especially\nwhen using functions built from type class methods. We believe
  this clarity is\nworth the inability to use ``DerivingVia`` to define ``Storable``
  instances.\n\n## Why do ``PackBytes``, ``PackWords`` and ``PackInto`` have ``Storable``
  instances, but not ``PackBits``?\n\nBecause it's not clear what this instance should
  look like. Let's suppose you want to bit-pack a\ntype ``Giraffe`` with cardinality
  11 - what should ``sizeOf`` for ``PackBits\nGiraffe`` be? How about ``alignment``?
  The only obvious solution is padding, but\nin this case, you might as well use ``PackBytes``,
  ``PackWords`` or\n``PackInto``, since then you'll at least know what you're getting,
  and are\nexplicit about it.\n\n## Sounds good! Can I use it?\n\nCertainly - we've
  tested on GHC 8.4.4, 8.6.5 and 8.8.1, on GNU/Linux only. If\nyou would like support
  for any additional GHC versions, let us know.\nUnfortunately, while the library
  will _build_ on 8.4.4, due to\n``hedgehog-classes`` being limited to 8.6+, tests
  cannot be run on this version.\n\nIf you build and use this library successfully
  on any other platforms, we'd like\nto know too - it'd be beneficial even if nothing
  breaks, and _especially_ if\nsomething does.\n\n## License\n\nThis library is under
