description: |-
  This package allows data types to be seen and manipulated as fixpoints of
  their underlying functors. It is mostly based on "Functional Programming with
  Bananas, Lenses, Envelopes and Barbed Wire" by Erik Meijer, Maarten Fokkinga
  and Ross Paterson (<http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/meijer91functional.html>). It
  makes essential use of associated types and related extensions.
