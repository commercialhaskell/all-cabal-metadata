  A functional 3D graphics library.

  We're just getting started, so abstractions are in flux.  I think we'll
  want this library to have functional 3D and rely on another library (e.g.,
  Reactive) for animation and reactivity.

  If you want to try things out from inside ghci, use the following command line.

  ghci -isrc:FieldTrip-GLUT/src:examples examples/Test.hs
