  Fig is a Haskell package for parsing and manipulation of [Xfig files][1].

  The package has a Cabal setup and can be installed this way:

      $ runhaskell Setup configure
      $ runhaskell Setup build
      $ sudo runhaskell Setup install

  You can use the package without doing an install by editing the
  `Main.hs` file to suit your needs and building the program with the
  following command:

      $ ghc --make Main.hs -o fig2fig

  Run the program with a FIG file as input and view the results:

      $ ./fig2fig < transitive.fig > out.fig
      $ xfig out.fig

  The package has a [home page][0] with more information on its use and
  a [HackageDB page][2] with all releases of the package.
