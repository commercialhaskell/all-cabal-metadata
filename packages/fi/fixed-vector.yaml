synopsis: Generic vectors with statically known size.
changelog: ! "Changes in 1.2.0.0\n\n  * `Show` instance for data type now respect
  precedence.\n\nChanges in 1.1.0.0\n\n  * GHC8.4 compatibility release. Semigroup
  instances added and\n    semigroup dependency added for GHC7.10\n\nChanges in 1.0.0.0\n\n
  \ * Vector length now expressed as GHC's type level literals. Underlying\n    implementation
  still uses Peano numbers to perform induction. This doesn't\n    change user facing
  API much. Notably `FlexibleInstances` and\n    `GADTs`/`TypeFamiles` are now required
  to write `Arity` constraint.\n\n  * `Monad` constraint is relaxed to `Applicative`
  where applicable. Duplicate\n    functions are removed (`sequence` & `sequenceA`
  → `sequence`, etc)\n\n  * Module `Data.Vector.Fixed.Monomorphic` is dropped.\n\n
  \ * Construction of N-ary vectors reworked. `Make` type class is gone.\n\n  * Boxed
  arrays now use SmallArrays internally.\n\n  * `overlaps` is removed from API for
  mutable vectors.\n\n  * `Data.Vector.Fixed.defaultRnf` is added.\n\n  * `Data.Vector.Fixed.Mutable.lengthI`
  is dropped.\n\nChanges in 0.9.0.0\n\n  * Simplification of `Arity` type class. This
  change shouldn't affect client\n    code.\n\n  * Support for GHC < 7.8 is droppped.\n\n
  \ * Fixed bug in `any`.\n\n\nChanges in 0.8.1.0\n\n  * `find` function added.\n\n\nChanges
  in 0.8.0.0\n\n  * NFData instances for all data type.\n\n  * Storable instances
  for all data types and default implementation of\n    Storable's methods added.\n\n
  \ * {i,}zipWith3 and {i,}zipWithM_ added.\n\n\nChanges in 0.7.0.3\n\n  * GHC 7.10
  support\n\n\nChanges in 0.7.0.0\n\n  * Type level addition for unary numbers added\n\n
  \ * `concat` function added\n\n  * More consistent naming for functions for working
  with `Fun`\n\n\nChanges in 0.6.4.0\n\n  * Isomorphism between Peano numbers and
  Nat added. (GHC >= 7.8)\n\n\nChanges in 0.6.3.1\n\n  * Documentation fixes.\n\n\nChanges
  in 0.6.3.0\n\n  * Left scans added.\n\n\nChanges in 0.6.2.0\n\n  * `Vec1` type synonym
  for boxed/unboxed/etc. vectors added.\n\n  * Vector instance for Data.Typeable.Proxy
  (GHC >= 7.8)\n\n\nChanges in 0.6.1.1\n\n  * GHC 7.8 support\n\n\nChanges in 0.6.1.0\n\n
  \ * `distribute` `collect` and their monadic variants added.\n\n\nChanges in 0.6.0.0\n\n
  \ * Data instance for all array-based vectors added.\n\n  * Storable instance added
  for `Storable.Vec`.\n\n  * Monoid instances added for all vectors.\n\n\nChanges
  in 0.5.1.0\n\n  * Zero-element vector `Empty'`is added.\n\n\nChanges in 0.5.0.0\n\n
  \ * `ContVec` now behaves like normal vector. `Arity` type class is\n    reworked.
  `Id' data type is removed.\n\n  * Construction of vector reworked.\n\n  * `reverse`,
  `snoc`, `consV`, `fold` and `foldMap` are added.\n\n  * Type changing maps and zips
  are added.\n\n  * Vector indexing with type level numbers is added.\n\n  * Twan
  van Laarhoven's lens added. (`element` and `elementTy`)\n\n  * Ord instances added
  to vector data types defined in the library.\n\n\nChanges in 0.4.4.0\n\n  * Functor
  and Applicative instances are added to Id.\n\n\nChanges in 0.4.3.0\n\n  * Typeable
  instance for S and Z added.\n\n\nChanges in 0.4.2.0\n\n  * 1-tuple `Only` added.\n\n
  \ * `fromList'` and fromListM added.\n\n  * apply functions from Arity type class
  generalized.\n\n\nChanges in 0.4.1.0\n\n  * `cons` function added.\n\n  * Getter
  for `Fun` data type added.\n\n\nChanges in 0.4.0.0\n\n  * Wrapper for monomorphics
  vectors is added.\n\n  * `VecList` is reimplemented as GADT and constructors are
  exported.\n\n  * Constructor of `ContVecT` is exported\n\n  * Empty `ContVecT` is
  implemented as `empty`.\n\n  * Typeable, Foldable and Traversable instances are
  added where\n    appropriate\n\n\nChanges in 0.3.0.0\n\n  * Vector type class definition
  is moved to the D.V.F.Cont module.\n\n  * Indexing function restored.\n\n  * `unfoldr`
  added.\n\n\nChanges in 0.2.0.0\n\n  * Continuation-based vector added.\n\n  * Right
  fold added.\n\n  * tailWith, convertContinuation, and ! from\n    Data.Vector.Fixed
  removed.\n\n  * Vector instance for tuples added.\n\n\nChanges in 0.1.2\n\n  * imap,
  imapM, ifoldl, ifoldM, zipWithM, izipWithM\n    functions are added.\n\n  * VectorN
  type class added.\n\n\nChanges in 0.1.1\n\n  * foldM and tailWith added. Type synonyms
  for numbers up to 6 are\n    added. Fun is reexported from Data.Vector.Fixed.\n"

description: ! 'Generic library for vectors with statically known

  size. Implementation is based on

  <http://unlines.wordpress.com/2010/11/15/generics-for-small-fixed-size-vectors/>

  Same functions could be used to work with both ADT based vector like


  > data Vec3 a = a a a


  Tuples are vectors too:


  >>> sum (1,2,3)

  6


  Vectors which are represented internally by arrays are provided by

  library. Both boxed and unboxed arrays are supported.


  Library is structured as follows:


  * Data.Vector.Fixed

  Generic API. It''s suitable for both ADT-based vector like Complex

  and array-based ones.


  * Data.Vector.Fixed.Cont

  Continuation based vectors. Internally all functions use them.


  * Data.Vector.Fixed.Mutable

  Type classes for array-based implementation and API for working with

  mutable state.


  * Data.Vector.Fixed.Unboxed

  Unboxed vectors.


  * Data.Vector.Fixed.Boxed

  Boxed vector which can hold elements of any type.


  * Data.Vector.Fixed.Storable

  Unboxed vectors of Storable  types.


  * Data.Vector.Fixed.Primitive

  Unboxed vectors based on pritimive package.'
