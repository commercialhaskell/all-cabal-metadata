  # First-class type families [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/first-class-families.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/first-class-families) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Lysxia/first-class-families.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Lysxia/first-class-families)

  First-class type families are type-level functions that can be
  composed using higher-order functions.

  The core of the idea is an extensible kind of "type-level expressions"
  and an open type family for evaluating such expressions.

  ```haskell
  type Exp (k :: Type) :: Type
  type family Eval (e :: Exp k) :: k
  ```

  This library provides that core foundation,
  and also exports basic first-class type families.

  ## Example

  For example, consider this simple type family:

  ```haskell
  type family   FromMaybe (a :: k) (m :: Maybe k) :: k
  type instance FromMaybe a 'Nothing  = a
  type instance FromMaybe a ('Just b) = b
  ```

  With first-class-families (fcfs), it translates to a `data` declaration
  and instances for a single `Eval` family:

  ```haskell
  import Fcf

  data FromMaybe :: k -> Maybe k -> Exp k
  type instance Eval (FromMaybe a 'Nothing)  = a
  type instance Eval (FromMaybe a ('Just b)) = b
  ```

  That way, the `FromMaybe` constructor can be partially applied,
  and passed to higher-order fcfs such as `Map`:

  ```haskell
  Eval (Map (FromMaybe 0) '[ 'Just 1, 'Nothing ])  =  '[ 1, 0 ] :: [Nat]
  ```

  Essential language extensions:

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE
      DataKinds,
      PolyKinds,
      TypeFamilies,
      TypeInType,
      TypeOperators,
      UndecidableInstances #-}
  ```

  ## Overview

  - `Fcf.Core`: definition of `Exp` and `Eval`.
  - `Fcf.Combinators`: general combinators to compose first-class families.
  - `Fcf.Data.*`: first-class families on common data types.
  - `Fcf.Class.*`: overloaded first-class families.
  - `Fcf.Utils`: miscellaneous.

  The top-level module `Fcf` is a prelude to get acquainted with the library.
  For regular use, import what you need from the specialized modules
  above, preferably with explicit import lists.

  ```haskell
  import Fcf                       -- Simple but fragile

  import Fcf.Class.Functor (FMap)  -- Explicit and robust
  ```

  ## Features

  ### Overloaded type families

  Value-level functions can be overloaded using type classes.
  Type families---type-level functions---are open by design,
  so overloading is as easy as just declaring them with more general types.

  ```haskell
  data Map :: (a -> Exp b) -> f a -> Exp (f b)

  -- Instances for f = []
  type instance Eval (Map f '[]) = '[]
  type instance Eval (Map f (x ': xs)) = Eval (f x) ': Eval (Map f xs)

  -- Instances for f = Maybe
  type instance Eval (Map f 'Nothing) = 'Nothing
  type instance Eval (Map f ('Just x)) = 'Just (Eval (f x))
  ```
