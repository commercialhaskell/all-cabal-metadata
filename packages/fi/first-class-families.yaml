  # First-class type families [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/first-class-families.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/first-class-families) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Lysxia/first-class-families.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Lysxia/first-class-families)

  For example, consider this simple type family:

  ```haskell
  type family   FromMaybe (a :: k) (m :: Maybe k) :: k
  type instance FromMaybe a 'Nothing  = a
  type instance FromMaybe a ('Just b) = b
  ```

  With first-class-families, it translates to a `data` declaration
  and instances for a single `Eval` family:

  ```haskell
  import Fcf

  data FromMaybe :: k -> Maybe k -> Exp k
  type instance Eval (FromMaybe a 'Nothing)  = a
  type instance Eval (FromMaybe a ('Just b)) = b
  ```

  That way, the `FromMaybe` constructor can be passed to higher-order fcfs.

  ```haskell
  Eval (Map (FromMaybe 0) '[ 'Just 1, 'Nothing ])  =  '[ 1, 0 ] :: [Nat]
  ```

  Essential language extensions:

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE
      DataKinds,
      PolyKinds,
      TypeFamilies,
      TypeInType,
      TypeOperators,
      UndecidableInstances #-}
  ```
