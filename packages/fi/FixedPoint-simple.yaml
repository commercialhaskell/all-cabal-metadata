description: |-
  This library uses elementary techniques to implement fixed point types in terms
  of basic integrals such as Word64.  All mathematical operations are implemented
  explicilty, instead of lifting to Integer, so that this code can be used for
  educational purposes or as a basis for fixed point libraries in other languages.
