description: ! 'A general sequence representation with arbitrary

  annotations, for use as a base for implementations of

  various collection types. This is an implementation modified

  to use associated types instead of functional dependencies.

  For a tuned sequence type, see @Data.Sequence@ in the

  @containers@ package, which is a specialization of

  this structure.


  Examples are not available in this package. However I am

  working on an @fingertree-extensible@ package which will use

  an idea based on types a la carte to provide composable annotations

  and that package will include examples :D'
