  # fits-parse

  FITS - Flexible Image Transport System

  This project focuses on building a Haskell native parser for FITS files. This file format is used widely by Astronomers and those analyzing astronomical data. There is currently a C library called `fitsio` and a Haskell wrapper for the library. However, this library can be cumbersome to use and the Haskell bindings are very thin and close to the metal of the `fitsio` library. This project focuses on providing good Haskell bindings and datatypes by implementing the FITS spec directly in Haskell, without the need for a C library. The reference for this work comes from NASA in the US. Conformance is currently limited to the Version 4.0 specification with no extensions. See [the NASA site](https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_standard.html) for more details and to download the spec.

  # Reading Documentation

  The [readthedocs](https://fits-parse.readthedocs.org) pages contain documentation for the *examples*.
  The [API Haddock](https://krakrjak.github.io/fits-parse/index.html) docs for the *master* branch are
  on github.io, release documentation will be on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fits-parse).

  You can build the Haddocks for offline use with `stack build --haddock`.

  # RTD Building

  To build the [readthedocs](https://fits-parse.readthedocs.org) docs you need `sphinx`. To install it
  locally for a single user use `pip` with the `--user` option to install `sphinx` and `sphinx-rtd-theme`.
  Alternatively, on Ubuntu you can install the `python3-sphinx` and `python3-sphinx-rtd-theme` package.
