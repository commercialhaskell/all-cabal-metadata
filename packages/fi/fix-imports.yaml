synopsis: Program to manage the imports of a haskell module
changelog: ! "### 2.1.0\n\n- unqualified syntax changed to support multiple imports
  per module\n\n- add `format: leave-space-for-qualified` and `format: no-group`\n\n-
  add import-as config option\n\n    E.g. import Data.Text.Lazy as DTL, instead of
  always having to qualify\n    as a suffix, like Lazy, or Text.Lazy.\n\n- various
  bugs with unqualified imports\n\n#### 2.0.0\n\n- add support for unqualified imports
  for explicitly configured symbols, via\nthe `unqualified` field in `.fix-imports`\n\n-
  significant speed improvement, reuse the loaded pkg index instead of asking\nghc-pkg
  find-module\n\n- --debug now emits timing metrics\n\n- import-order-{first,last}
  are exact matches, or are prefix matches if they\nhave a trailing dot\n\n- prio-module-{high,low}
  are now exact matches instead of prefix\n\n#### 1.1.0\n\n- Rename import-order to
  import-order-first, and add import-order-last.\n\n#### 1.0.5\n\n- support haskell-src-exts
  > 1.16\n\n- add 'language' field to .fix-imports, to turn on local extensions\n\n####
  1.0.3 and 1.0.4\n\n- upgrade to haskell-src-exts-1.16\n\n#### 1.0.2\n\n- Fix bug
  where a qualified import with >1 dot wasn't found.  And don't\nmess with Prelude.\n\n####
  1.0.1\n\n- Fix a bunch of bugs: properly recognize unqualified imports as imports,\nnever
  import the current module, don't pick up modules with the same suffix\nbut a different
  name.\n\n#### 1.0.0\n\n- Change name from FixImports to fix-imports, which is more
  unixy.\n\n- Change ghc-pkg parsing from String to Text.  It's noticeably faster.\n\n-
  Add a more flexible system for prioritizing imports.\nWhen there are several possibilities
  for a module name, they are all given\nto a single function to decide.  The config
  file moved from\nfix-imports-priority to .fix-imports and can now specify sort orders
  for\npackages and modules by prefix.\n\n- Make -i includes for non-existent dirs
  ignored instead of causing an\nerror.\n"

description: ! '`fix-imports` is a small standalone program to manage the import block
  of a

  haskell program.  It will try to add import lines for qualified names

  with no corresponding import, remove unused import lines, and keep the

  import block sorted, with optional rules for grouping.


  Support for unqualified imports is limited to symbols you explicitly configure,

  so if you list `System.FilePath.(</>)`, it will add that import when you use

  it, or remove when it''s no longer used, but it won''t go search modules for

  unqualified imports.


  It doesn''t mess with non-managed unqualified imports, so you can still use

  unqualified imports, you just have to do it manually.


  Since it''s a unix-style filter, it should be possible to integrate into any

  editor.  There''s an example vimrc to bind to a key in vim.
