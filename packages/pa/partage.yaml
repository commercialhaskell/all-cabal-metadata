description: |-
  The library implements an Earley-style, bottom-up parser for tree adjoining
  grammars (TAGs) with special focus on structure (and, hence, computation) sharing.

  Two particular flavours of structure sharing are currently implemented:

  * Subtrees common to different elementary trees are shared amongst them.
  The input TAG, which can be seen as a set of elementary (initial and auxiliary)
  grammar trees, is in fact transformed into an equivalent DAG.

  * Flat production grammar rules representing the individual parts of the DAG
  are then compressed in the form of a minimal FSA. Other forms of
  compression are also provided by the library (e.g. prefix tree).
