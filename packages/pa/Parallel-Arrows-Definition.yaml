description: |-
  Arrows are a suitable abstraction for parallel programming. This package offers a general interface for parallelizing Arrows. This package however only contains the interface and code written against it must be used with a backend such as @Parallel-Arrows-Multicore@, @Parallel-Arrows-ParMonad@, @Parallel-Arrows-Eden@ in order to have any parallel speedup. This package also contains some parallel skeletons such as variants of parMap and some topology skeletons.
