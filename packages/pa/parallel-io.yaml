description: |-
  This package provides combinators for sequencing IO actions onto a thread pool. The
  thread pool is guaranteed to contain no more unblocked threads than a user-specified upper limit, thus
  minimizing contention.

  Furthermore, the parallel combinators can be used reentrantly - your parallel
  actions can spawn more parallel actions - without violating this property of the thread pool.

  The package is inspired by the thread <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/56499/focus=56521>.
  Thanks to Neil Mitchell and Bulat Ziganshin for some of the code this package is based on.
