description: |-
  Parsec is designed from scratch as an industrial-strength parser
  library.  It is simple, safe, well documented (on the package
  homepage), has extensive libraries and good error messages,
  and is also fast.  It is defined as a monad transformer that can be
  stacked on arbitrary monads, and it is also parametric in the
  input stream type.

  This package comes without the compatibility layer for parsec2.

  Note, that the module names overlap with those of newer parsec
  versions, therefore I do not recommend to unconditionally use parsec3
  as dependency in cabal files of packages for hackage.  But you may
  want to develop your code using this subset of parsec3 modules and
  finally change the dependency from parsec3 to parsec in order to
  avoid module ambiguities for users just installing your package.  Your
  own module ambiguities are best avoided by hiding packages.

  This version reflects the changes of parsec-3.1.8
