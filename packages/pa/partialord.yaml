  # partialord

  A data structure supporting partial orders, and some helpful
  associated routines.

  ## Other packages

  An alternative package is already available, namely
    [partial-order](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/partial-order).
  Differences include:
  * PartialOrd has a comparison valued in Maybe Ordering; we use a fresh
    type.
  * Where types have several natural partial orderings, we provide
    newtypes rather than choosing one.
