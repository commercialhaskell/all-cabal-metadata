synopsis: A fast parser combinator library backed by Typed Template Haskell
changelog: "# Revision history for `parsley-core`\n\n## 1.0.0.0  -- 2021-06-12\n\n*
  First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n* Core factored out of the main
  `parsley` package\n\n## 1.0.1.0 -- 2021-06-26\n\n* Introduced `Lam` to the API and
  conversion functions for `Core.Defunc`\n* Extra type ascriptions added to generated
  code\n\n## 1.0.1.1 -- 2021-06-27\n\n* Added input factoring to `try p <|> q` and
  also forms with `f <$> try p <|> q` and `try p $> x <|> q`\n\n## 1.1.0.0 -- 2021-07-01\n\n*
  Switched both backends to make use of `Lam` instead of `Core.Defunc`, reducing burden
  on GHC\n* Added duplication avoidance optimisation when value to be duplicated is
  `Lam.Var True`\n\n## 1.2.0.0 -- 2021-07-01\n\n* For GHC 8.10+, leveraged the static
  structure of functions:\n  * Handlers are now static functions, reducing the beta-reduction
  required by GHC, `fatal` now generates better code\n  * Return continuations are
  also static functions, reducing beta-reduction required by GHC, `halt` generates
  better code\n  * Recursive calls are also static functions, removing a lot of junk
  with the conversion from iterators to recursion\n* Registers are now bound once
  for recursive parsers, which close over their free-registers\n* Strictness has been
  updated to reflect the reduced burden on GHC to optimise: now strictness is for
  performance, and \n  not to coax GHC to optimise at the cost of performance\n* Removed
  the \"bad\" binding for `Sat`, handlers are always bound on creation, so the binding
  is basically meaningless\n* Performance on 8.10+ is anywhere from 10-20% faster
  than 1.1.0.0"

description: "# Parsley Internals\n\nThis package contains the internals for the [`parsley`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsley-core)
  library. \n\nThe version policy adheres to the regular Haskell PVP, but the two
  major versions are distinguished: \nthe first is the _Public API_ major version,
  which represents backwards incompatible changes\nin the regular PVP sense that effect
  the `parsley` package itself and its users; the second version is the\n_Internal
  API_ major version, which would only effect users who use part of the internal parsley\nmodules.
  As such, for people that are **not** explicitly importing anything from `Parsley.Internal`,
  or\nits submodules, the second major version does not matter: `0.2.0.0` and `0.3.0.0`
  would be compatible,\nfor instance."
