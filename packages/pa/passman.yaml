  ## Executive Summary

  This package is a very paranoid password manager.  It consists of two
  parts: a front-end command-line interface, and a back-end library
  (which can be used to create prettier interfaces).

  It is important to note that there is no password recovery service.
  If you enter an incorrect master password, you will simply get
  incorrect passwords from the database.  This is by design.  It makes
  the password database much more resistant to a brute-force attack.
  DON'T FORGET YOUR MASTER PASSWORD.

  Once installed, the program can be run by typing `passman` in your
  terminal.

  ## Installing

  This package uses [Haskell Stack](https://haskellstack.org).  Please
  refer to [their
  website](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install)
  for instructions on installing Haskell Stack.  Once you have done
  this, you can simply enter the command `stack install passman` in the
  terminal to install passman.
