description: "\nPalindromes\n==============================================\n\n[Palindromes]
  is a package for finding palindromes in files.\n\n[Palindromes]: http://www.jeuring.net/homepage/palindromes/index.html\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\nThe
  primary features of [Palindromes] include:\n\n*  Linear-time algorithm for finding
  exact palindromes\n*  Linear-time algorithm for finding text palindromes, \n   ignoring
  spaces, case of characters, and punctuation \n   symbols.\n*  Linear-time algorithm
  for finding word palindromes,\n   text palindromes surrounded by (if at all) non-letters.\n*
  \ Linear-time algorithm for finding palindromes in DNA.\n*  Quadratic-time algorithm
  for finding approximate \n   palindromes, in which a limited number of symbols\n
  \  may be substituted by other symbols\n*  Quadratic-time algorithm for finding
  palindromes with\n   gaps in the center.\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n[Palindromes]
  has the following requirements:\n\n*  [GHC] version 6.8.1 or later - It has been
  tested with version 7.4.1.\n*  [Cabal] library version 1.2.1 or later - It has been
  tested with version \n           1.10.2.0.\n\n[GHC]: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/\n[Cabal]:
  http://www.haskell.org/cabal/\n\n\nDownload & Installation\n-----------------------\n\n*If
  you have [cabal-install]*, you should use that to install the package,\nbecause
  it will handle everything for you.\n\n    cabal install palindromes\n\n*If you don't
  have cabal-install*, you must download the [Palindromes package] \nfrom HackageDB
  and install it manually. Get the `tar.gz` file and decompress it.\n\nOnce downloaded,
  use the following commands for configuring, building, and\ninstalling the library.\n\n
  \   runghc Setup.lhs configure\n    runghc Setup.lhs build\n    runghc Setup.lhs
  install\n\nFor more details on the general options available, refer to the [Cabal
  User's\nGuide].\n\n[Palindromes package]: \n  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/palindromes\n[cabal-install]:
  \n  http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Cabal-Install\n[Cabal User's Guide]: \n  http://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nThe
  API is documented using [Haddock] and available on the [Palindromes package] \nsite.\n\n[Haddock]:

  can find example palindromes, on which Palindromes has been tested, in the \n[`examples`
  directory] of the source distribution.\n\n[`examples` directory]: \n  https://subversion.cs.uu.nl/repos/staff.johanj.palindromes/trunk/examples/palindromes\n\n\nBugs

  Palindromes].\n\nFor general concerns and questions, [email the author].\n\n[project
