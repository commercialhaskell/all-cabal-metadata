description: |-
  Parsimony is a generalized and simplified version of the
  industrial-strength parser combinator library Parsec.
  Like Parsec, it is simple, safe, well documented, convenient,
  with good error messages, and fast.  In addition, Parsimony
  adds support for working with differet types of input such as
  byte strings (for compat input representation) and
  lazy byte strings (for parsing large amounts of data).
  It also supports working with text in different character
  encodings such as UTF8.
