changelog: |
  0.8:

  * relPath, absPath, filePath, dirPath deprecated in favor of
    Path.rel, Path.abs, Path.absRel, Path.file, Path.dir
    Same for the according type synonyms.

  * Deprecate extended path construction functions:
    mkAbsPath, mkAbsPathFromCwd, mkPathAbsOrRel, mkPathFileOrDir
    You better combine path constructors and further manipulations.

  * Deprecate functions based on path strings.
    You should better use functions from the filepath package.

  * absRel -> withAbsRel, fileDir -> withFileDir
    We do not need these functions very often
    and instead we need Path.absRel as constructor name
    that is consistent with Path.abs and Path.rel.

  * Split main module into multiple one,
    in order to use a consistent name set for every aspect.

    E.g. we have:
    Path.Abs: an absolute path
    Path.Part.Abs: absolute (drive) part of a path
    Path.PartClass.Abs: class for an absolute part

    Path.AbsRel: an absolute or relative path
    Path.Part.AbsRel: initial part of an absolute or relative path
    Path.PartClass.AbsRel: class for absolute or relative parts

    Path.Abs -> Part.Abs
    Path.AbsOrRel -> Part.AbsRel
    Path.AbsOrRelClass -> PartClass.AbsRel
    Path.FileOrDirClass -> PartClass.FileDir

  0.7:

  * Move absRel and fileDir out of their classes.
    A problem would arise if someone writes
      import System.Path (AbsRelClass(absRel))
    He would have to replace it by
      import System.Path (AbsRelClass, absRel)

  * Monoid instance for Path.RelDir
    Requires helper classes IsRel, IsDir.
    IsAbs and IsFile added for completeness.

  * Declare infix precedences of </>, <.> and <++> such that we can write:
      dir0 </> dir1 </> dir2 </> base <++> "-foo" <++> "-bar" <.> "tar" <.> "gz"
    This is similar to the fixities in the 'filepath' package,
    but differs slightly
    since in our package paths and extensions have different types.

  * Import packages 'transformers' and 'utility-ht'
    that allow for some simplifications.

  * Deprecate asPath,
      asRelFile, asRelDir, asAbsFile, asAbsDir,
      asRelPath, asAbsPath, asFilePath, asDirPath

  * Recommended are now the checking constructors 'path', maybePath, parsePath,
      relFile, relDir, absFile, absDir,
      relPath, absPath, filePath, dirPath

  * replace IsString instance for OverloadedStrings
    by an instance that cannot be implemented.

  * getDirectoryContents is no longer synonym to relDirectoryContents.
    Instead it returns the list of all directory objects as RelFileOrDir.
    This is closer to the getDirectoryContents function
    from the 'directory' package.

  * clarify meaning of AbsRel and FileDir tags of a path

  * clarify meaning of drive-relative paths on Windows

  * clarify handling of file system links

  0.6:

  * joinPath: restrict to RelPath and atomic path components

  * Add type class constraints and restrict types
    in order to make the functions work with the new datatype.
    E.g. we need to fix the type to FilePath
    wherever a function requires a non-empty path.

  * Add support for MS Windows paths with leading drive labels

  0.5.5:

  * AbsRelClass, FileDirClass: turn into closed-world classes.
    Strict accordance to PVP would require to bump version to 0.6,
    but since the user cannot write instances of this class,
    we can hardly break code.

  * instance {Show, Read} Path now emit and parse valid Haskell expressions

  * IO.withFile restricted to FilePath
    This changes API but it should only break buggy code.

  0.5.4.3:

  * Make test suite static part of the source code,
    but maintain a program to update the test suite to changed tests.

  0.5.4.1:

  * Merge git back to darcs, continue on hub.darcs.net

  0.5.4:

  * Migrated from darcs to git (on GitHub)

  0.5.3:

  * Upgrades + changes for GHC 7.6.1 - by Ben Millwood

  0.5.0:

  * Added System.Path.Windows and System.Path.Posix modules. These are modelled on the System.FilePath approach to supporting the two styles of path.

  0.0.2:

  * Split System.Path.Directory into its own module
  * Implemented covers for all the remaining System.Directory functions
  * Renamed 'hasExtension' to 'hasAnExtension', and added new 'hasExtension' fn which checks for a given extension
  * Renamed the '...FileOrDir...' functions to be 'generic...' (thanks to Neil Mitchell for the suggestion!)
  * Added support for OverloadedStrings
  * Renamed the 'mk...' unchecked construction functions to 'as...' to better reflect what they do
  * Added: makeAbsolute, makeAbsoluteFromCwd, genericMakeAbsolute, genericMakeAbsoluteFromCwd
  * Added: mkAbsPath, mkAbsPathFromCwd
  * Added System.Path.IO to cover System.IO
  * Made the internal 'Path' type strict
  * Removed 'splitDirectories' as it serves no purpose not covered by 'splitPath'
  * Changed behaviour of 'getDirectoryContents' to return relative paths
  * Fixed the type of 'setCurrentDirectory'

  # Construction of type-safe paths

  You can use the construction functions as follows:

      f :: Path.RelFile
      f = relDir "tmp" </> relFile "someFile" <.> "ext"

  or ...

      f :: Path.RelFile
      f = dirPath "tmp" </> filePath "someFile" <.> "ext"

  or ...

      f :: Path.RelFile
      f = path "tmp" </> path "someFile" <.> "ext"

  or just ...

      f :: Path.RelFile
      f = relFile "tmp/someFile.ext"

  The first and the last implementations force the most specific types
  and thus should be prefered.

  Overloaded string literals are no longer supported,
  since this extension is intended for alternative text storage types.
  It would also decrease the type safety
  if you could omit the path type and let the compiler guess its type.


  # Modules

  You will typically want to import as follows:

      import qualified System.Path.Directory as Dir
      import qualified System.Path.IO as PathIO
      import qualified System.Path as Path
      import System.Path ((</>))

  `System.Path.Generic` provides all functions with the OS as type parameter.
  `System.Path.Posix` and `System.Path.Windows`
  offers only path constructors and destructors
  fixed to the corresponding operating system.
  `System.Path` exports either `System.Path.Posix` or `System.Path.Windows`
  depending on the host system
  and additionally the manipulation functions from `System.Path.Generic`.
  This mix should be appropriate for the average use
  and should free the user from writing type annotations.


  # How to choose proper type arguments

  The `ar` and the `fd` type parameters have quite different meaning.
  The types `Abs` and `Rel` refer to a property of the path,
  whereas the type `File` and `Dir` refers to a property of a disk object.
  You can decide whether a path is absolute or relative
  by just watching (the beginning of) the path string.
  In contrast to that, you have to access the disk
  in order to check the existence and type of a disk object.
  Even more, the disk object might change at any time,
  e.g. the user might delete a file and create a directory of the same name,
  or the disk object might not exist,
  and the purpose of the path is to create an according file or directory.
  That's why even if you have a path of type `FilePath ar`,
  every function accessing the file must check
  that the refered object exists and is a file.
  Conversely, there is not much sense in checking the disk object type
  and then chosing the path accordingly.
  Instead, you must choose the path type according
  to what type of disk object your application needs.
  The reality check must be performed
  and is performed by the standard functions
  for every access to the object.
  If a disk object is not of the type required by the path type
  then this is a runtime exception that must be handled at runtime
  but it is not a programming error.

  Sometimes you have to change the type of a path
  as an intermediate step to construct a path for an object of different type.
  E.g. you may convert the path "pkg" from `DirPath` to `FilePath`
  because in the next step you like to extend it to "pkg.tar.gz".
  This is valid use of the `Path` type.
  E.g. the function `dropExtensions`
  reduces the `FilePath` "pkg.tar.gz" to the new `FilePath` "pkg"
  although no-one expects that there is or will be a file with name "pkg".
  Thus, if a function has a `FilePath` parameter
  then there is no warranty that it accesses the according file
  and does not touch related disk objects.
  It may well be that the function derives other file and directory names
  from the path and accesses them.
  That is, a `FilePath` or `DirPath` parameter
  is mainly for documentation purposes
  but it cannot prevent you seriously from any damage.


  # How to cope with user input

  You may get a path from the user, e.g. as command-line argument.
  It might be either absolute or relative
  and it might refer to an actual file or directory or
  to something yet non-existing.
  In most cases it will not be important
  whether the path is absolute or relative,
  thus you should choose the `AbsRel` type parameter.
  If somewhere in the program an `Abs` path is needed
  then you can assert that the path is actually absolutized somewhere
  e.g. by `dynamicMakeAbsolute`.
  If you prevent usage of `genericMakeAbsolute`
  then you avoid to absolutize a path that is already absolutized.

  The choice of the `fd` type parameter follows a different reasoning:
  Often you have a clear idea of
  whether the user must pass a file or directory path.
  The rule is: Just give the path the type you expect
  but do not perform any checking
  (unless you want to warn the user earlier about imminent danger).
  The disk object type must be checked for every access to the object, anyway,
  so there is no point in checking it immediately.
  With your choice of the `fd` parameter
  you just document its intended use.

  It might be that the path is only a base name
  used to construct other directory and file names.
  E.g. for an Audacity project named `music`
  you have to create the directory `music_data` and the file `music.aup`.
  In this case we recommend to give `music` the type `FilePath`.
  This type warrants that there is at least one final path component
  in contrast to a directory path that might be empty.
  You can easily convert a file path to a directory path
  using `Path.dirFromFile`.
  The reverse conversion is partial.


  # AbsRel vs. `ar` type parameter

  In your application you will often know
  whether your path denotes a file or directory,
  thus you will use the `Path.File` or `Path.Dir` type synonym.
  In contrast to that, you will often not know
  whether the path is relative or absolute
  and often it does not even matter.
  You can express this either by using the monomorphic type `Path.AbsRelFile`
  or by using the parameterized type `Path.File ar`
  with constraint `PathClass.AbsRel ar`.
  We recommend to use the first variant for command-line option parsing
  and the second one for the application functions.
  When you parse options it is the time where you know that you do not know
  whether the path is absolute or relative.
  That is, you could neither parse it as `Path.Abs` nor as `Path.Rel`.
  Thus a type variable makes no sense.
  You should always parse to type `Path.AbsRel`.
  Conversely, your application would work equally well with
  `Path.Abs`, `Path.Rel` and `Path.AbsRel`.
  Thus, using an `ar` type variable is the way to go.
  You must make sure to use different `ar`-like variables for independent paths.
  By equality of `ar`-like type variables
  you can also document dependencies of paths for the programmers.


  # Command-line argument parsing with `optparse-applicative`

  For parsing of path options with the `optparse-applicative` package
  you might use the following helper functions:

      module Option where

      import qualified System.Path.PartClass as PathC
      import qualified System.Path as Path
      import qualified Options.Applicative as OP

      path :: (PathC.FileDir fd) => OP.ReadM (Path.AbsRel fd)
      path = OP.eitherReader Path.parse

      pathArgument ::
         PathC.FileDir fd =>
         OP.Mod OP.ArgumentFields (Path.AbsRel fd) -> OP.Parser (Path.AbsRel fd)
      pathArgument = OP.argument path

      pathOption ::
         PathC.FileDir fd =>
         OP.Mod OP.OptionFields (Path.AbsRel fd) -> OP.Parser (Path.AbsRel fd)
      pathOption = OP.option path

  It performs minimal checking of path strings as part of option parsing.
  E.g. it will report a user error if the user passes "abc/" as a file path.


  # File system links

  This package does not explicitly handle file system links.
  We treat a file path containing links like any other file path.
  The same holds for directory paths.
  A link is handled like any other path component.


  # Drive-relative paths on MS Windows

  We use the `Rel` type for paths that can be relative to any directory.
  We use the `Abs` type for all other paths,
  i.e. for paths with explicit locations or
  with restrictions on the set of locations.
  Windows has a notion of drives and
  maintains a current directory for every drive.
  E.g. the path `"c:text.txt"` refers to the current directory of drive `C`.
  Since it cannot be freely combined with other directories
  we treat this path like an absolute path.
  This is consistent with the behaviour of the `filepath` package.
  E.g. `filepath` evaluates all of the expressions
  `"\\abs" </> "c:driverel"`, `"c:\\abs" </> "c:driverel"`,
  `"d:\\abs" </> "c:driverel"` to `"c:driverel"`.
  In our package you would have to use `genericMakeAbsolute`
  but we recommend to avoid its use.


  # Path format strings

  You might allow a user to pass a format string such as
  `"page%06d.png"` to your program.
  How to integrate this into the type-safe path handling?
  We recommend not to use the `Path` for the format string
  but instead to define a custom type:

      newtype Format ar fd = Format String

      printf ::
         (PathC.AbsRel ar) =>
         Format ar fd -> Int -> Either String (Path ar fd)
      printf (Format fmt) n = Path.parse (Pf.printf fmt n)

  This makes sure that you will access a path on disk
  only after formatting the path string.


  # Known problems

  ## Mac

  Currently we select the Posix module on Mac systems.
  On the one hand this choice is right
  since Mac uses slashes for path component separation.
  On the other hand it is wrong
  since Mac ignores case when comparing filepaths.
