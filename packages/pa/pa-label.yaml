  # `pa-label`

  One-module library to provide nice anonymous labelled tuples and enums.

  If you have a function:

  ```
  doBlorb
    :: Text
    -> Text
    -> Bool
    -> Bool
    -> Bool
    -> IO Text
  doBlorb username password read write insert = do …
  ```

  what do you do? At call-site you don’t see the names of any of the types.

  Before GHC 9.2, one strategy would have been to create a newtype for every single argument:

  ```
  data Username = Username Text
  data Password = Password Text
  data Read = Read Bool
  data Write = Write Bool
  data Insert = Insert Bool
  ```

  but that is very verbose and leaks into global scope!

  Instead, do this:

  ```
  doBlorb
    :: Label "username" Text
    -> Label "password" Text
    -> Label "read" Bool
    -> Label "write" Bool
    -> Label "insert" Bool
    -> IO (Label "blorb" Text)
  doBlorb username password read write insert = do …
  ```

  then it becomes clear to the call-site, what to do. In the function you can access the labels with record dots to get to the inner types, e.g. `username.username`, `read.read`.

  Even better, you can bundle things into anonymous tuples:

  ```
  doBlorb
    :: T2 "username" Text
          "password" Text
    -> T3 "read" Bool
          "write" Bool
          "insert" Bool
    -> IO (Label "blorb" Text)
  doBlorb user permission = do …
  ```

  and access inside the function like `user.username` or `permission.read`. So much nicer!

  We provide tuples up to size 3, for anything bigger the you should really just create a normal record with `data`. The great thing is that no use-site has to be adjusted as long as you name the record fields the same and use record-dot syntax everywhere.

  There’s some experimental support for anonymous enums (`E2/E3`), they are useful in some situations, but not as often as anonymous tuples in our experience.

  Approaches like [vinyl](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vinyl) or [superrecord](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/superrecord) are more general, but very hard to understand and lead to bad error messages.

  We have found that in practice it is nicer to use the a lot less magical and slightly more verbose `T2/T3` and switch to normal records once you reach 4 fields.
