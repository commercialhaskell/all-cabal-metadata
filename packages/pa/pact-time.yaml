  # Revision history for pact-time

  ## 0.3.0.0 -- 2024-06-30

  Breaking changes:

  *   Replaced dependency on the vector-spaces package by internal public
      `numeric` library.

      Most notably class method `zeroV` is now just called `zero`. Otherwise, most
      numeric operators remain identical and are now (re-)exported by the main
      module `Pact.Time`.

  Other changes:

  *   Support for builds with GHC-9.10.1.

  ## 0.2.0.2 -- 2023-05-11

  *   Support mtl-2.3

  ## 0.2.0.1 -- 2022-10-25

  *   Relax upper bound on base
  *   Support GHC versions 9.2 and 9.4

  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2021-05-07

  *   Move all modules from `Data.Time` to `Pact.Time`.

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2021-05-06

  *   First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  # Pact-Time Library

  A minimal time library for usage with the [Pact Smart Contract
  Language](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact/).

  The focus of this library is on minimality, performance, and binary level
  stability. Time is represented as a 64-bit integral value that counts nominal
  micro-seconds since the modified Julian date epoch (MJD). The implementation
  ignores leap seconds.

  While the library can parse date-time values with time zones, internally all
  date-times are represented as UTC and formatting only supports UTC. Only the
  default English language locale is supported.

  Details about supported formats can be found in the [Pact Language
  Reference](https://pact-language.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pact-reference.html#time-formats).
