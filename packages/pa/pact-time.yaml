  # Pact-Time Library

  A minimal time library for usage with the [Pact Smart Contract
  Language](https://github.com/kadena-io/pact/).

  The focus of this library is on minimality, performance, and binary level
  stability. Time is represented as a 64-bit integral value that counts nominal
  micro-seconds since the modified Julian date epoch (MJD). The implementation
  ignores leap seconds.

  While the library can parse date-time values with time zones, internally all
  date-times are represented as UTC and formatting only supports UTC. Only the
  default English language locale is supported.

  Details about supported formats can be found in the [Pact Language
  Reference](https://pact-language.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pact-reference.html#time-formats).
