  # Revision history for package-version

  All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

  The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
  and this project adheres to the [Haskell Package Versioning Policy](https://pvp.haskell.org/).

  ## [0.4] -- 2024-08-13
  ### Removed
  * `Pretty` instances removed as these were not very useful.
  * `Read` instance removed as it was of dubious utility (`fromText` is better).

  ### Changed
  * Internal representation now uses `NonEmpty Word` instead of `[Int]`.
  * Because the representation now preserves the desired invariants (non-empty
    and non-negative), the type is now fully exposed from the non-internal
    module. In particular, the original data constructor `UnsafePackageVersion`
    is replaced with `MkPackageVersion`.

  ### Added
  * Updated bounds on `base`, `bytestring`, and `template-haskell`.
  * Added `HasCallStack` to `unsafePackageVersion`.

  ## [0.3] -- 2022-10-21
  ### Changed
  * Minimum length is now 1, not 2. This is due to cabal allowing package
    versions with a single digit.
  * Accordingly, `mempty` is now `[0]`, not `[0,0]`.
  * The `ValidationErrorTooShort` data constructor renamed to `ValidationErrorEmpty`.
  * Field `unPackageVersion` removed as it allows unsafe construction via record
    update syntax. This is now an ordinary function.

  ### Added
  * GHC 9.4 support.

  ## [0.2] -- 2022-07-25
  ### Changed
  * Renamed error data constructors to improve consistency.
  * Modified errors' `Exception` instances to use `pretty` over default `show`.

  ### Added
  * Added `Generic` instance to `PackageVersion`.

  ### Fixed
  * Used `bytestring` for reading file over bespoke function.

  ## [0.1.0.0] -- 2021-12-19

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  # Package Description

  This package defines a `PackageVersion` type that represents [PVP](https://pvp.haskell.org/) version numbers. We provide functionality for reading these numbers from cabal files at both runtime and compile-time, the latter being useful when implementing `--version` options in executables. See the haddocks on hackage for more information.

  ## Alternatives

  Reading the cabal version can also be achieved by utilizing the generated `Paths_<pkg-name>` module. For instance, for a package named `foo`, we first add the generated module to our list of modules in `foo.cabal`:

  ```cabal
  cabal-version:      2.4
  name:               foo
  version:            0.1

  ...

  library
    other-modules:   Paths_foo
    autogen-modules: Paths_foo
  ```

  Then we can reference this in our code:

  ```haskell
  import Data.List (intercalate)
  import Data.Version (Version(versionBranch))
  import Paths_foo qualified as Paths

  vsn :: String
  vsn = intercalate "." $ fmap show $ versionBranch Paths.version
  ```

  See the [documentation](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/3.10/cabal-package.html#accessing-data-files-from-package-code) for more details.
