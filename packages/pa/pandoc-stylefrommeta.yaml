synopsis: Pandoc filter to customize links, images and paragraphs
changelog: |+
  ### 0.2.1.0

  - Ensure that *para_style* is always found (different versions of Pandoc may
    render contents of *MetaBlocks* as *Para* or *Plain*).

  ### 0.2.0.0

  - Render substitutions using Pandoc's writers.
  - Improved matching algorithms in metadata blocks.
  - Implemented a new method of substitution using code blocks in metadata. This
    method must be preferred for all output formats.
  - Added verbatim placeholders `$$SRC$$` and `$$TITLE$$`, and placeholder
    `$$ALT$$` in which all formatting is removed.

  ### 0.1.1.0

  - Added support for Pandoc 2.0.
  - Dropped support for GHC older than 7.8 (pattern synonyms are required).

  styleFromMeta
  =============

  Pandoc filter to apply styles found in the metadata of the document to various
  objects.

  Styling is supported for following types of objects:

  - Standalone and inlined images
  - Links
  - Paragraphs (with restrictions, see below)

  Styles are read from the metadata of the document: they may reside inside the
  document or in a separate YAML file. For example,

  ```yaml
      ---
      img_style :
        html : |
          ~~~~~
          <div style="clear: both; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 16px">
          <a href="$SRC$" style="margin-left: 10em;" alt="$ALT$">
          <img border="0" src="$SRC$" /></a></div>
          ~~~~~
        latex : |
          ~~~~~
          \begin{center}
          \includegraphics{$$SRC$$}
          \end{center}
          ~~~~~
        rst: |
          ~~~~~
          .. image:: $$SRC$$
             :height: 100px
             :width: 200 px
             :scale: 50 %
             :alt: $$ALT$$
             :align: right
          ~~~~~
        haddock: |
          ~~~~~
          <<$$SRC$$ An image $ALT$>>
          ~~~~~
      link_style :
        html : |
          ~~~~~
          <a href="$SRC$" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">$ALT$</a>
          ~~~~~
        latex : |
          ~~~~~
          \href{$SRC$}{\colorbox{green}{$ALT$}}
          ~~~~~
      para_style :
        html : |
          <span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 16px;"></span>
      ...
  ```

  declares styles `img_style`, `link_style` and `para_style`. Their names (except
  for the last) are arbitrarily chosen and may be referred from the document, for
  example

  ```markdown
      ![$img_style$](../images/an_image.png)
      [$link_style$ *here*](http://example.com/)
  ```

  Placeholders `$ALT$`, `$SRC$` and `$TITLE$` from style declarations are to be
  replaced by corresponding data found in the object declaration. In this example
  `*here*` corresponds to `$ALT$`, and `http://example.com/` corresponds to
  `$SRC$`. Placeholders `$$SRC$$` and `$$TITLE$$` are replaced verbatim, in
  `$$ALT$$` all formatting gets removed. In the example `$$SRC$$` is used to keep
  underscores unescaped as they may reside in image names.

  Notice that all metablocks contents, with the exclusion of `para_style`, are
  wrapped inside code blocks. This let the contents be substituted verbatim for
  any output format. However, raw HTML and TeX blocks are well supported by
  Pandoc, so we could rewrite parts of the example like this:

  ```yaml
      ---
      img_style :
        html : |
          <div style="clear: both; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 16px">
          <a href="$SRC$" style="margin-left: 10em;" alt="$ALT$">
          <img border="0" src="$SRC$" /></a></div>
        latex : |
          \begin{center}
          \includegraphics{$$SRC$$}
          \end{center}

      # ...

      ...
  ```

  The filter has support for raw HTML and TeX blocks, but this support is not
  complete, and in some cases substitutions may fail. In addition, Pandoc may
  re-format substitutions. That's why this method is not recommended to use.

  As soon as paragraphs do not have place where to put extra data, style
  `para_style` is applied to all paragraphs in the document. Currently, only
  transformation to a span block is supported (which is probably useful only in
  HTML). Any contents found between opening and closing span tags are ignored:
  actual paragraph contents will be inserted inside them. Notice that wrapping
  inside code blocks is not allowed in `para_style` block.
