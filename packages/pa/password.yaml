  # Changelog for `password`

  ## 3.0.1.0

  -   Argon2 hashes without a version field are interpreted as being of version 1.0
      Thanks to [@Vlix](https://github.com/Vlix)
      [#56](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/56)

  ## 3.0.0.0

  -   Split the main datatypes module (`Data.Password`) into a separate package: `password-types`.
      The new package just contains `Password`, `PasswordHash`, `Salt` and their helper functions/instances.
  -   Adjusted entire `password` package to use the `Data.Password.Types` from this new `password-types`.
      Thanks to [@Vlix](https://github.com/Vlix)
      [#40](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/40)
  -   Argon2: fixed the producing and checking of Argon2 hashes.
      The base64 padding is removed when producing hashes and when
      checking hashes it will accept hashes with or without padding.
      [#45](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/45)

  ## 2.1.1.0

  -   Fixed `homepage` links in the `.cabal` files.
      [#34](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/34)
      Thanks to [@Radicalautistt](https://github.com/Radicalautistt)
  -   Updated the `defaultPasswordPolicy` and documentation of the
      `Data.Password.Validate` module using information about research done on
      "memorized secrets" (i.e. passwords) by the NIST.
      [#31] https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/31
      Thanks to [@agentultra](https://github.com/agentultra) for pointing out
      the research and starting the PR.
      [#39](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/39)
      Thanks to [@Vlix](https://github.com/Vlix) for updating the rest of the
      documentation.
  -   Small spelling and other documentation fixes.

  ## 2.1.0.0

  -   A new `Validate` module has been added to dictate policies that passwords
      should adhere to and the necessary API to verify that they do.
      [#26](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/26)
      Huge thanks to [@HirotoShioi](https://github.com/HirotoShioi) for picking
      up the task of adding this functionality and doing most of the groundwork.
      [#27](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/27)
      Thanks to [@Vlix](https://github.com/Vlix) for finishing up the API and
      documentation.

  ## 2.0.1.1

  -   Fixed cross-module links in the haddocks.
      [#19](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/19) Thanks to
      [@TristanCacqueray](https://github.com/TristanCacqueray) for fixing this.

  ## 2.0.1.0

  -   Switched checking hashes to using `Data.ByteArray.constEq`, instead of
      the default `(==)` method of `ByteString`. This is to make it more secure
      against timing attacks. [#16](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/16)
      Thanks to [@maralorn](https://github.com/maralorn) for bringing this up.

  ## 2.0.0.1

  -   Fixed README markdown for hackage.

  ## 2.0.0.0

  -   Complete overhaul of the library to include hashing and checking
      passwords with not just `scrypt`, but also `PBKDF2`, `bcrypt` and
      `Argon2`.
      [#8](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/8)
  -   `cryptonite` is now used as a dependency, instead of the `scrypt` package.
      [#8](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/8)
  -   Done away with abbreviating "password" (`Pass/pass` -> `Password/password`)
      [#8](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/8)
  -   Removed `unsafeShowPasswordText` and changed `unsafeShowPassword` to be
      `Password -> Text`. (Anyone who needs it to be a `String` knows where to
      find `Data.Text.unpack`)
      [#8](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/8)
  -   GHC versions < 8.2 are no longer actively supported.
      (Tested to work for GHC 8.2.2)

  ## 1.0.0.0

  -   `hashPassWithSalt` has switched function arguments for better currying.
      [#6](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/6)
      Although be warned that multiple passwords
      [should not be hashed with the same salt](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/6#discussion_r370455681).
  -   Removed `Read` instance from `Pass` and added `Show` instance.
      [#6](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/6)
      See [#5](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/issues/5#issuecomment-576958351)
      for justification of this.
  -   `newSalt` is now `MonadIO m` instead of `IO`.
      [#6](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/6)
  -   `PassCheckSucc` has been renamed to `PassCheckSuccess`.
      [#6](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/6)
  -   Hide data constructor from `Pass` and add the `mkPass` function to construct a `Pass`.
      [#6](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/6)
  -   Thanks to Felix Paulusma ([@Vlix](https://github.com/Vlix)) for the above
      changes!

  ## 0.1.0.1

  -   Small fix to make sure the doctests build with stack.

  This library provides functions for working with passwords and password hashes in Haskell.

  Currently supports the following algorithms:

  * `PBKDF2`
  * `bcrypt`
  * `scrypt`
  * `Argon2`

  Also, see the [password-instances](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/password-instances)
  package for instances for common typeclasses.
