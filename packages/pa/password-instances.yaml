  # Changelog for `password-instances`

  ## 3.0.0.0

  -   The `password-instances` library now depends on the new
      `password-types` package, instead of on the `password` package.
      [#40](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/40)
      Thanks to [@Vlix](https://github.com/Vlix)
  -   Small update to the README
  -   Changed `PersistField` instance of `PasswordHash` to use
      `decodeUtf8'` for better handling of UTF8 decoding exceptions.
      [#43](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/43)

  ## 2.0.0.2

  -   Fixed `homepage` links in the `.cabal` files.

  ## 2.0.0.1

  -   Fixed README markdown for hackage.

  ## 2.0.0.0

  -   No longer re-exports anything from `password` to be

  -   Added instances for "forbidden" type classes with custom type errors.
      [#8](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/8)

  ## 1.0.0.0

  -   Various changes re-exported from the `password` package.
      [#6](https://github.com/cdepillabout/password/pull/6)

  ## 0.3.0.1

  ## 0.3.0.0
