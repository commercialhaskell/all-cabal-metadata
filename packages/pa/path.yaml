  Motivation\n\nIt was after working on a number of projects at FP Complete that use
  file\npaths in various ways. We used the system-filepath package, which was\nsupposed
  to solve many path problems by being an opaque path type. It\noccurred to me that
  the same kind of bugs kept cropping up:\n\n* Expected a path to be absolute but
  it was relative, or vice-versa.\n\n* Expected two equivalent paths to be equal or
  order the same, but they did\n  not (`/home//foo` vs `/home/foo/` vs `/home/bar/../foo`,
  etc.).\n\n* Unpredictable behaviour with regards to concatenating paths.\n\n* Confusing
  files and directories.\n\n* Not knowing whether a path was a file or directory or
  relative or absolute\n  based on the type alone was a drag.\n\nAll of these bugs
  are preventable.\n\n## Approach\n\nMy approach to problems like this is to make
  a type that encodes the\nproperties I want and then make it impossible to let those
  invariants be\nbroken, without compromise or backdoors to let the wrong value “slip\nin”.
  Once I have a path, I want to be able to trust it fully. This theme\nwill be seen
  throughout the things I lay out below.\n\n## Solution\n\nAfter having to fix bugs
  due to these in our software, I put my foot down\nand made:\n\n* An opaque `Path`
  type (a newtype wrapper around `String`).\n\n* Smart constructors which are very
  stringent in the parsing.\n\n* Make the parsers highly normalizing.\n\n* Leave equality
  and concatenation to basic string equality and\n  concatenation.\n\n* Include relativity
  (absolute/relative) and type (directory/file) in the\n  type itself.\n\n* Use the
  already cross-platform\n  [filepath](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/filepath)
  package for\n  implementation details.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### The data types\n\nHere
  is the type:\n\n```haskell\nnewtype Path b t = Path FilePath\n  deriving (Typeable)\n```\n\nThe
  type variables are:\n\n* `b` — base, the base location of the path; absolute or
  relative.\n* `t` — type, whether file or directory.\n\nThe base types can be filled
  with these:\n\n```haskell\ndata Abs deriving (Typeable)\ndata Rel deriving (Typeable)\n```\n\nAnd
  the type can be filled with these:\n\n```haskell\ndata File deriving (Typeable)\ndata
  Dir deriving (Typeable)\n```\n\n(Why not use data kinds like `data Type = File |
  Dir`? Because that imposes\nan extension overhead of adding `{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds
  #-}` to every module\nyou might want to write out a path type in. Given that one
  cannot construct\npaths of types other than these, via the operations in the module,
  it’s not\na concern for me.)\n\nThere is a conversion function to give you back
  the filepath:\n\n```haskell\ntoFilePath :: Path b t -> FilePath\ntoFilePath (Path
  l) = l\n```\n\nBeginning from version 0.5.3, there are type-constrained versions
  of\n`toFilePath` with the following signatures:\n\n```haskell\nfromAbsDir  :: Path
  Abs Dir -> FilePath\nfromRelDir  :: Path Rel Dir -> FilePath\nfromAbsFile :: Path
  Abs File -> FilePath\nfromRelFile :: Path Rel File -> FilePath\n```\n\n### Parsers\n\nTo
  get a `Path` value, you need to use one of the four parsers:\n\n```haskell\nparseAbsDir
  \ :: MonadThrow m => FilePath -> m (Path Abs Dir)\nparseRelDir  :: MonadThrow m
  => FilePath -> m (Path Rel Dir)\nparseAbsFile :: MonadThrow m => FilePath -> m (Path
  Abs File)\nparseRelFile :: MonadThrow m => FilePath -> m (Path Rel File)\n```\n\nThe
  following properties apply:\n\n* Absolute parsers will reject non-absolute paths.\n\n*
  The only delimiter syntax accepted is the path separator; `/` on POSIX and\n  `\\`
  on Windows.\n\n* Any other delimiter is rejected; `..`, `~/`, `/./`, etc.\n\n* All
  parsers normalize into single separators: `/home//foo` → `/home/foo`.\n\n* Directory
  parsers always normalize with a final trailing `/`. So `/home/foo`\n  parses into
  the string `/home/foo/`.\n\nIt was discussed briefly whether we should just have
  a class for parsing\nrather than four separate parsing functions. In my experience
  so far, I have\nhad type errors where I wrote something `like x <- parseAbsDir\nsomeAbsDirString`
  because `x` was then passed to a place that expected a\nrelative directory. In this
  way, overloading the return value would’ve just\nbeen accepted. So I don’t think
  having a class is a good idea. Being\nexplicit here doesn’t exactly waste our time,
  either.\n\nWhy are these functions in `MonadThrow`? Because it means I can have
  it\nreturn an `Either`, or a `Maybe`, if I’m in pure code, and if I’m in `IO`,\nand
  I don’t expect parsing to ever fail, I can use it in IO like this:\n\n```haskell\ndo
  x <- parseRelFile (fromCabalFileName x)\n   foo x\n   …\n```\n\nThat’s really convenient
  and we take advantage of this at FP Complete a lot.\nThe instances\n\nEquality,
  ordering and printing are simply re-using the `String` instances:\n\n```haskell\ninstance
  Eq (Path b t) where\n  (==) (Path x) (Path y) = x == y\n\ninstance Ord (Path b t)
  where\n  compare (Path x) (Path y) = compare x y\n\ninstance Show (Path b t) where\n
  \ show (Path x) = show x\n```\n\nWhich gives us for free the following equational
  properties:\n\n```haskell\ntoFilePath x == toFilePath y        ≡ x == y           --
  Eq instance\ntoFilePath x `compare` toFilePath y ≡ x `compare` y    -- Ord instance\ntoFilePath
  x == toFilePath y        ≡ show x == show y -- Show instance\n```\n\nIn other words,
  the representation and the path you get out at the end are\nthe same. Two paths
  that are equal will always give you back the same thing.\n\n### Smart constructors\n\nFor
  when you know what a path will be at compile-time, there are\nconstructors for that:\n\n```haskell\n$(mkAbsDir
  \"/home/chris\")\n$(mkRelDir \"chris\")\n$(mkAbsFile \"/home/chris/x.txt\")\n$(mkRelFile
  \"chris/x.txt\")\n```\n\nWith the [QuasiQuotes](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#ghc-flag--XQuasiQuotes)\nlanguage
  extension, paths can be written as follows:\n\n```haskell\n[absdir|/home/chris|]\n[reldir|chris|]\n[absfile|/home/chris/x.txt|]\n[relfile|chris/x.txt|]\n```\n\nThese
  will run at compile-time and underneath use the appropriate parser.\n\n### Overloaded
  strings\n\nNo `IsString` instance is provided, because that has no way to statically\ndetermine
  whether the path is correct, and would otherwise have to be a\npartial function.\n\nIn
  practice I have written the wrong path format in a `$(mk… \"\")` and been\nthankful
  it was caught early.\n\n### Operations\n\nThere is path concatenation:\n\n```haskell\n(</>)
  :: Path b Dir -> Path Rel t -> Path b t\n```\n\nGet the parent directory of a path:\n\n```haskell\nparent
  :: Path Abs t -> Path Abs Dir\n```\n\nGet the filename of a file path:\n\n```haskell\nfilename
  :: Path b File -> Path Rel File\n```\n\nGet the directory name of a directory path:\n\n```haskell\ndirname
  :: Path b Dir -> Path Rel Dir\n```\n\nStripping the parent directory from a path:\n\n```haskell\nstripDir
  :: MonadThrow m => Path b Dir -> Path b t -> m (Path Rel t)\n```\n\n## Review\n\nLet’s
  review my initial list of complaints and see if they’ve been\nsatisfied.\n\n###
  Relative vs absolute confusion\n\nPaths now distinguish in the type system whether
  they are relative or\nabsolute. You can’t append two absolute paths, for example:\n\n```haskell\nλ>
  [absdir|/home/chris|]</>[absdir|/home/chris|]\n<interactive>:23:31-55:\n    Couldn't
  match type ‘Abs’ with ‘Rel’\n```\n\n### The equality problem\n\nPaths are now stringently
  normalized. They have to be a valid path, and they\nonly support single path separators,
  and all directories are suffixed with a\ntrailing path separator:\n\n```haskell\nλ>
  $(mkAbsDir \"/home/chris//\") == $(mkAbsDir \"/./home//chris\")\nTrue\nλ> toFilePath
  $(mkAbsDir \"/home/chris//\") ==\n   toFilePath $(mkAbsDir \"/./home//chris\")\nTrue\nλ>
  ($(mkAbsDir \"/home/chris//\"),toFilePath $(mkAbsDir \"/./home//chris\"))\n(\"/home/chris/\",\"/home/chris/\")\n```\n\n###
  Unpredictable concatenation issues\n\nBecause of the stringent normalization, path
  concatenation, as seen above,\nis simply string concatenation. This is about as
  predictable as it can get:\n\n```haskell\nλ> toFilePath $(mkAbsDir \"/home/chris//\")\n\"/home/chris/\"\nλ>
  toFilePath $(mkRelDir \"foo//bar\")\n\"foo/bar/\"\nλ> [absdir|/home/chris//|]</>[reldir|foo//bar|]\n\"/home/chris/foo/bar/\"\n```\n\n###
  Confusing files and directories\n\nNow that the path type is encoded in the type
  system, our `</>` operator\nprevents improper appending:\n\n```haskell\nλ> [absdir|/home/chris/|]</>[relfile|foo//bar|]\n\"/home/chris/foo/bar\"\nλ>
  [absfile|/home/chris|]</>[relfile|foo//bar|]\n<interactive>:35:1-26:\n    Couldn't
  match type ‘File’ with ‘Dir’\n```\n\n### Self-documentation\n\nNow I can read the
  path like:\n\n```haskell\n{ fooPath :: Path Rel Dir, ... }\n```\n\nAnd know that
  this refers to the directory relative to some other path,\nmeaning I should be careful
  to consider the current directory when using\nthis in IO, or that I’ll probably
  need a parent to append to it at some\npoint.\n\n## In practice\n\nWe’ve been using
  this at FP Complete in a number of packages for some months\nnow, it’s turned out
  surprisingly sufficient for most of our path work with\nonly one bug found. We weren’t
  sure initially whether it would just be too\nmuch of a pain to use, but really it’s
  quite acceptable given the\nadvantages. You can see its use all over the\n[`stack`](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack)
  codebase.\n\n## Doing I/O\n\nCurrently any operations involving I/O can be done
  by using the existing I/O\nlibrary:\n\n```haskell\ndoesFileExist (toFilePath fp)\nreadFile
  (toFilePath fp)\n```\n\netc. This has problems with respect to accidentally running
  something like:\n\n```haskell\ndoesFileExist $(mkRelDir \"foo\")\n```\n\nBut I/O
  is currently outside the scope of what this package solves. Once you\nleave the
  realm of the `Path` type invariants are back to your responsibility.\n\nAs with
  the original version of this library, we’re currently building up a\nset of functions
  in a `Path.IO` module over time that fits our real-world\nuse-cases. It may or may
  not appear in the path package eventually. It’ll\nneed cleaning up and considering
  what should really be included.\n\n**Edit:** There is now\n[`path-io`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/path-io)
  package that\ncomplements the `path` library and includes complete well-typed interface
  to\n[`directory`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/directory) and\n[`temporary`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/temporary).
  There is work\nto add more generally useful functions from Stack's `Path.IO` to
  it and make\nStack depend on the `path-io` package.\n\n## Doing textual manipulations\n\nOne
  problem that crops up sometimes is wanting to manipulate\npaths. Currently the way
  we do it is via the filepath library and re-parsing\nthe path:\n\n```haskell\nparseAbsFile
  . addExtension \"/directory/path\" \"ext\" . toFilePath\n```\n\nIt doesn’t happen
  too often, in our experience, to the extent this needs to\nbe more convenient.\n\n##
  Accepting user input\n\nSometimes you have user input that contains `../`. The solution
  we went with\nis to have a function like `resolveDir`:\n\n```haskell\nresolveDir
  :: (MonadIO m, MonadThrow m)\n           => Path Abs Dir -> FilePath -> m (Path
  Abs Dir)\n```\n\nWhich will call `canonicalizePath` which collapses and normalizes
  a path and\nthen we parse with regular old `parseAbsDir` and we’re cooking with\ngas.
  This and others like it might get added to the `path` package.\n\n## Comparing with
  existing path libraries\n\n### filepath and system-filepath\n\nThe [filepath](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/filepath)
  package is\nintended as the complimentary package to be used before parsing into
  a Path\nvalue, and/or after printing from a Path value. The package itself contains\nno
  type-safety, instead contains a range of cross-platform textual\noperations. Definitely
  reach for this library when you want to do more\ninvolved manipulations.\n\nThe
  `system-filepath` package is deprecated in favour of `filepath`.\n\n### system-canonicalpath,
  canonical-filepath, directory-tree\n\nThe\n[`system-canonicalpath`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/system-canonicalpath)\nand
  the\n[`canonical-filepath`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/canonical-filepath)\npackages
  both are a kind of subset of `path`. They canonicalize a string\ninto an opaque
  path, but neither distinguish directories from files or\nabsolute/relative. Useful
  if you just want a canonical path but doesn’t do\nanything else.\n\nThe [`directory-tree`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/directory-tree)\npackage
  contains a sum type of dir/file/etc but doesn’t distinguish in its\noperations relativity
  or path type.\n\n### pathtype\n\nFinally, we come to a path library that path is
  similar to: the\n[`pathtype`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pathtype) library.
  There are\nthe same types of `Path Abs File` / `Path Rel Dir`, etc.\n\nThe points
  where this library isn’t enough for me are:\n\n* There is an `IsString` instance,
  which means people will use it, and will\n  make mistakes.\n\n* Paths are not normalized
  into a predictable format, leading to me being\n  unsure when equality will succeed.
  This is the same problem I encountered\n  in `system-filepath`. The equality function
  normalizes, but according to\n  what properties I can reason about? I don’t know.\n\n```haskell\nSystem.Path.Posix>
  (\"/tmp//\" :: Path a Dir) == (\"/tmp\" :: Path a Dir)\nTrue\nSystem.Path.Posix>
  (\"tmp\" :: Path a Dir) == (\"/tmp\" :: Path a Dir)\nTrue\nSystem.Path.Posix> (\"/etc/passwd/\"
  :: Path a b) == (\"/etc/passwd\" :: Path a b)\nTrue\nSystem.Path.Posix> (\"/tmp//\"
  :: Path Abs Dir) == (\"/tmp/./\" :: Path Abs Dir)\nFalse\nSystem.Path.Posix> (\"/tmp/../\"
  :: Path Abs Dir) == (\"/\" :: Path Abs Dir)\nFalse\n```\n* Empty string should not
  be allowed, and introduction of `.` due to that\n  gets weird:\n\n```haskell\nSystem.Path.Posix>
  fmap getPathString (Right (\".\" :: Path Rel File))\nRight \".\"\nSystem.Path.Posix>
  fmap getPathString (mkPathAbsOrRel \"\")\nRight \".\"\nSystem.Path.Posix> (Right
  (\".\" :: Path Rel File)) == (mkPathAbsOrRel \"\")\nFalse\nSystem.Path.Posix> takeDirectory
  (\"tmp\" :: Path Rel Dir)\n.\nSystem.Path.Posix> (getPathString (\".\" :: Path Rel
  File) ==\n                    getPathString (\"\" :: Path Rel File))\nTrue\nSystem.Path.Posix>
  ((\".\" :: Path Rel File) == (\"\" :: Path Rel File))\nFalse\n```\n\n* It has functions
  like `<.>/addExtension` which lets you insert an\n  arbitrary string into a path.\n\n*
  Some functions let you produce nonsense (could be prevented by a stricter\n  type),
  for example:\n\n```haskell\nSystem.Path.Posix> takeFileName (\"/tmp/\" :: Path Abs
  Dir)\ntmp\n```\n\nI’m being a bit picky here, a bit unfair. But the point is really
  to show\nthe kind of things I tried to avoid in `path`. In summary, it’s just hard
  to\nknow where things can go wrong, similar to what was going on in\n`system-filepath`.\n\n###
  data-filepath\n\nThe [`data-filepath`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/data-filepath)
  is\nalso very similar, I discovered it after writing my own at work and was\npleased
  to see it’s mostly the same. The main differences are:\n\n* Uses `DataKinds` for
  the relative/absolute and file/dir distinction which\n  as I said above is an overhead.\n\n*
  Uses a GADT for the path type, which is fine. In my case I wanted to\n  retain the
  original string which functions that work on the `FilePath`\n  (`String`) type already
  deal with well. It does change the parsing step\n  somewhat, because it parses into
  segments.\n\n* It’s more lenient at parsing (allowing `..` and trailing `.`).\n\nThe
  API is a bit awkward to just parse a directory, requires a couple\nfunctions to
  get it (going via `WeakFilePath`), returning only an `Either`,\nand there are no
  functions like parent. But there’s not much to complain\nabout. It’s a fine library,
  but I didn’t feel the need to drop my own in\nfavor of it. Check it out and decide
  for yourself.\n\n## Summary\n\nThere’s a growing interest in making practical use
  of well-typed file path\nhandling. I think everyone’s wanted it for a while, but
  few people have\nreally committed to it in practice. Now that I’ve been using `path`
  for a\nwhile, I can’t really go back. It’ll be interesting to see what new packages\ncrop
  up in the coming year, I expect there’ll be more.\n"
