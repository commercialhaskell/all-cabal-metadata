  ### 0.3.2.0

  - Improvement after the previous release: do not use */dev/tty* if the backend
    program is Neovim. The backend's flavor gets detected by testing against
    *has("nvim")* once at the first call.
  - As well, both the vim executable and the effective vim configuration file get
    detected once at the first call.

  ### 0.3.1.0

  - Do not throw the error if */dev/tty* cannot be open. Note that Neovim loads
    the syntax engine without *tty* emulation just fine. This allows using Neovim
    as *VIMHL_BACKEND* in environments where */dev/tty* is unavailable.

  ### 0.3.0.0

  - Support for packages *base* &lt; *4.8* and *pandoc-types* &lt; *1.20* was
    dropped.
  - If output format is *gfm*, the code block gets translated to a *RawBlock* in
    *HTML* format with style adhered to code blocks in Github README pages.
  - Use environment variable *VIMRC_PANDOC* to point to the custom vim
    configuration.
  - Cabal flag *debug* was removed.

  ### 0.2.0.1

  - Removed dependency on package *safe*.

  ### 0.2.0.0

  - Removed dependency on packages *regex-compat* and *cond*.

  ### 0.1.4.0

  - Use environment variable *VIMHL_BACKEND* to choose between vim flavors.

  ### 0.1.3.0

  - Updated after Pandoc *2.8* and the *String-to-Text* migration.

  ### 0.1.2.4

  - Removed *shebang* line as it may lead to compilation failures.

  ### 0.1.2.3

  - Added support for older GHC *7.8*.

  ### 0.1.2.2

  - Added Cabal flag *debug* (off by default) for printing how vim runs to
    *stderr*.

  ### 0.1.2.0

  - Better treatment of handles of temporary files.
  - Using *WriteMode* for vim process *std_in* prevents vim from getting
    unresponsive on *Ctrl-C* interrupts while still doing well its tasks.
  - Using */dev/null* for vim process *std_out*.
  - Exit program as soon as vim fails.
