  # Overview

  `park-bench` is a quick-and-dirty benchmarking tool for comparing the performance of Haskell functions. Specifically, it
  is designed to optimize the workflow in which a programmer makes a small change to a function and wants to measure its
  performance impact with as little friction as possible.

  # Configuration

  | Environment variable name | Type | Meaning | Default value |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | `PARK_BENCH_RUNLEN` | Float | The target number of seconds that each benchmark run takes | `0.1` |

  # Example usage

  Say I am interested in improving the performance of `fib`, which is a function defined in module `MyMathUtilities.Fib`
  in a local package called `my-math-utilities`.

  ## Step 1: Write the function you'd like to benchmark

  First, I'm going to copy the implementation of `fib` to a new top-level definition called `fastfib`, tweak its
  implementation, and export both from module `MyMathUtilities.Fib`.

  If `fib` was private before, that's ok. We only need to expose it for as long as we are interested in benchmarking.

  ```haskell
  module MyMathUtilities.Fib (fib, fastfib, ...) where
  ```

  ## Step 2: Write a standalone `bench/Main.hs` module with a `main` function

  Next, I'm going to write a standalone `Main.hs` in a subdirectory called `bench`, which will be compiled to an
  executable that runs my benchmark.

  ```haskell
  module Main where

  -- The module in my local package that I want to benchmark
  import MyMathUtilities.Fib

  -- This library
  import ParkBench

  main :: IO ()
  main =
    benchmark
      [ function "fib" fib 20
      , function "fastfib" fastfib 20
      ]
  ```

  ## Step 3: Define an executable component

  Next, I'm going to define an executable component for my benchmark in my `my-math-utilities.cabal` file.

  ```cabal
  executable bench
    build-depends:
      base,
      -- The local package that I want to benchmark
      my-math-utilities,
      -- This library
      park-bench
    default-language: Haskell2010
    ghc-options: -O -rtsopts -with-rtsopts=-T
    hs-source-dirs: bench
    main-is: Main.hs
  ```

  I need to compile the benchmark with `-rtsopts -with-rtsopts=-T`, otherwise my benchmark will not be able to get RTS
  statistics from GHC at runtime.

  Alternatively, I could compile the benchmark with only `-rtsopts`, but then I'll have to provide `+RTS -T` to the
  executable later.

  ## Step 4: Run the benchmark

  If all goes well, I'll have an executable component to run.

  ```
  cabal run my-math-utilities:exe:bench
  ```
  ```
  stack run my-math-utilities:exe:bench
  ```

  Or, if I only compiled with `-rtsopts`, but not `-with-rtsopts=-T`,

  ```
  cabal run my-math-utilities:exe:bench -- +RTS -T
  ```
  ```
  stack run my-math-utilities:exe:bench -- +RTS -T
  ```

  ## Step 5: Clean up

  After benchmarking, I can choose to keep the benchmark (and associated executable component) around, but I'll probably
  delete them instead. I've learned something, collected some sweet screenshots for my PR, and I'm ready to move on.

  # Caveat emptor

  The statistical analysis performed by `park-bench` is simplistic, written by a novice, and may have bugs. Results should
  not necessarily be trusted; please use (or at least compare to) a different tool.
