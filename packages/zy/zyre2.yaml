  # Changelog for zyre2


  ## 0.1.1.0

  Developed and tested with zyre release 2.0.1.

  Supports most functionality of zyre, excluding:

   * Draft API
   * Gossip protocol discovery

  The following zyre functions are excluded:

   * int zyre_set_endpoint (zyre_t *self, const char *format, ...) CHECK_PRINTF (2);
   * void zyre_gossip_bind (zyre_t *self, const char *format, ...) CHECK_PRINTF (2);
   * void zyre_gossip_connect (zyre_t *self, const char *format, ...) CHECK_PRINTF (2);

  # Zyre bindings for Haskell

  This is a haskell package 'zyre2' for using the C library zyre. The package requires
  'czmq' and 'zyre' to be installed on the system.

  The bindings has support for all zyre features, except the following:

   * Gossip protocol discovery
   * Binding specfic endpoints

  ## Experimental

  The package is currently in an experimental state. The bindings have been tested and validated using the standard zyre examples (minimal.c, chat.c) with 'valgrind', and no memory leaks are found. That stated, there could be issues which have not been uncovered during testing and the library could potentially leak memory or at worst segfault your entire process.

  The API may also drastically change, should the current API prove cumbersome to work with.

  Tread with care (for now).

  ## Documentation

  The package is thoroughly documented with haddock, which can be found at X or generated using 'cabal haddock' or 'stack haddock'.
