  # Release Notes

  ## 4.3

  ### Fixes

  * Fixed memory leak due to typo in ```Z3.Base.C```. (Deian Stefan)

  ### New API support

  * Added partial support for _Fixedpoint_ API. (David Heath)
  * Added more bindings to the _Models_ API. (Daniel Gröber)
  * Added _Parser interface_ API. (Tristan Knoth)

  ### Misc

  * After many requests, I have moved the repository to GitHub: https://github.com/IagoAbal/haskell-z3.
  * From now on the revision number (aka patch level) 0 will be omitted (so x.y instead of x.y.0).

  ## 4.2.0

  This release removes support for SMT-LIB 1.x in order to be compatible with Z3 4.6.

  ## 4.1.2

  This minor release extends the supported quantifiers API, and adds
  partial support for Z3's proof tactics.

  * Improved support for theorem proving with quantifiers. (Jakub Daniel)

  ## 4.1.1

  Another small release, made possible thanks to third-party contributions.

  * Added bindings for getting the accessors of datatype constructors. (William Hallahan)
  * Added bindings for declaring mutually recursive datatypes. (William Hallahan)
  * Added partial support for the _Interpolation_ API. (Jakub Daniel)
  * Added bindings for deconstructing function applications. (Jakub Daniel)
  * Added bindings for ```simplify``` and ```simplifyEx```. (Gleb Popov)
  * Some code cleanup. (Jakub Daniel and Iago Abal)

  ## 4.1.0

  Small maintenance release that however introduces one API breaking change.

  * Added bindings for the _Set_ API. (Nadia Polikarpova)
  * Fix #4: Replace the now deprecated Z3_eval with Z3_model_eval.
  * Fix #5: Check error codes right after an API call. (David Castro)

  To fix #4 we had to change the type of ```modelEval```, which now takes
  an extra ```Bool``` parameter (to force model completion).

  ## 4.0.0

  This release brings support for the new Z3 4.x API,
  and *removes* support for the old API.
  We are following a new version policy, yet compatible with Haskell's PVP.
  So new versions are of the form *x.y.z*,
  where *x* is the version of Z3 API supported,
  *y* is a major revision of the bindings,
  and *z* is a minor revision of the bindings.
  Consequently, we bumped the version to *4.0.0* :-).

  Special thanks to Nadia Polikarpova,
  who diagnosed a problem in our use of ```ForeignPtr``` finalizers,
  and proposed a fix.

  ### Cabal package

  * Relaxed dependencies, and removed upper bounds.

  ### New features and API functions

  * Switched to Z3 4.x API.
  * Reference counting is managed by the gargabe collector.
  * Algebraic datatypes. (KC Sivaramakrishnan)
  * ```Z3_get_ast_kind```, ```Z3_solver_check_assumptions```, ```Z3_solver_get_unsat_core```. (Nadia Polikarpova)
  * ```Z3_mk_fresh_const```, ```Z3_mk_fresh_func_decl```. (KC Sivaramakrishnan)
  * ```MonadFix``` instance for the ```Z3``` monad. (Pepe Iborra)
  * Hspec test-suite, with just a couple of tests, more to come...
  * A few more helpers for creating numerals, evaluating expressions, and so on.
  * Module ```Z3.Base.C```, a very low-level interface to Z3 C API, is now exported.
    Just in case you want to write your own marshaling layer ;-)

  ### Removals and API-breaking changes

  * No more support for the old Z3 3.x API.
  * Removed ```Z3.Lang``` module, this should re-appear as a separate package soon.
  * ```MonadZ3``` instances must be ```Applicative```.
  * Numerals API is now closer to Z3 C API.
    So, for instance, ```mkInt``` now takes both an integer and a sort.
    You can use ```mkInteger``` or ```mkIntNum``` instead.
  * ```Z3.Monad.assertCnstr``` is now called ```Z3.Monad.assert```.

  ### Refactoring and clean-up

  * Reduce boilerplate in Z3.Base.
  * Fix docs to distinguish Z3 API functions and helpers.

  ## 0.3.2

  Thanks to Scott West and Nadia Polikarpova for contributing to this release.

  ### Fixes

  * Fixed _solverCheckAndGetModel_ to return a model from an unknown satisfiability result, if one exists. (Nadia Polikarpova)
  * Fixed mkMap API function to do **not** take the number of arrays as an input parameter, this should be equals to the length of the input array list.
    Strictly speaking this is a minor break of the API but it was considered a but and therefore fixed.

  ### Refactoring and clean-up

  * Reduced marshalling boilerplate in Z3.Base.
    This is a very important step towards supporting Z3 4.0 API.
  * Improved API documentation.
    If you are having difficulties due to (presumably) poor API or source documentation, please let us know.

  ### New features

  * Support running multiple queries under the same logical context, using _evalZ3WithEnv_. (Scott West)

  ### Newly supported API functions

  * Many solver-related API functions (Scott West and Nadia Polikarpova).
  * z3_mk_forall_const (Scott West), z3_mk_exists_const.
  * Z3_get_version.

  ### Deprecations

  * We deprecate _showContext_, _showModel_ and _getModel_; since we prefer to avoid deviations from Z3 API names.
    Use _contextToString_, _modelToString_ and _checkAndGetModel_ instead.
  * We deprecate the Z3.Lang interface, that will be moved to a separate pacakge.
    Few people is using this (_DSL_ish) interface and it is arguably more unstable than Z3.Base or Z3.Monad.
    It also introduces dependencies with GHC extensions like type families that we prefer to avoid in a more stable package.

  ### Misc

  * Add SMT to categories in z3.cabal.

  # Haskell bindings for Microsoft's Z3 (unofficial)

  These are Haskell bindings for the Z3 theorem prover.
  We don't provide any high-level interface (e.g. in the form of a Haskell eDSL) here,
  these bindings are targeted to those who want to build verification tools on top of Z3 in Haskell.

  ## Installation

  Preferably use the [z3](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/z3) package.

  * Install a [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) *4.8.x* release.
  * Just type _cabal install z3_ if you used the standard locations for dynamic libraries (_/usr/lib_) and header files (_/usr/include_).

      * Otherwise use the _--extra-lib-dirs_ and _--extra-include-dirs_ Cabal flags when installing.

  ## Example

  Most people uses the ```Z3.Monad``` interface.
  Here is an example script that solves the 4-queen puzzle:

      import Control.Applicative
      import Control.Monad ( join )
      import Data.Maybe
      import qualified Data.Traversable as T

      import Z3.Monad

      script :: Z3 (Maybe [Integer])
      script = do
        q1 <- mkFreshIntVar "q1"
        q2 <- mkFreshIntVar "q2"
        q3 <- mkFreshIntVar "q3"
        q4 <- mkFreshIntVar "q4"
        _1 <- mkInteger 1
        _4 <- mkInteger 4
        -- the ith-queen is in the ith-row.
        -- qi is the column of the ith-queen
        assert =<< mkAnd =<< T.sequence
          [ mkLe _1 q1, mkLe q1 _4  -- 1 <= q1 <= 4
          , mkLe _1 q2, mkLe q2 _4
          , mkLe _1 q3, mkLe q3 _4
          , mkLe _1 q4, mkLe q4 _4
          ]
        -- different columns
        assert =<< mkDistinct [q1,q2,q3,q4]
        -- avoid diagonal attacks
        assert =<< mkNot =<< mkOr =<< T.sequence
          [ diagonal 1 q1 q2  -- diagonal line of attack between q1 and q2
          , diagonal 2 q1 q3
          , diagonal 3 q1 q4
          , diagonal 1 q2 q3
          , diagonal 2 q2 q4
          , diagonal 1 q3 q4
          ]
        -- check and get solution
        fmap snd $ withModel $ \m ->
          catMaybes <$> mapM (evalInt m) [q1,q2,q3,q4]
        where mkAbs x = do
                _0 <- mkInteger 0
                join $ mkIte <$> mkLe _0 x <*> pure x <*> mkUnaryMinus x
              diagonal d c c' =
                join $ mkEq <$> (mkAbs =<< mkSub [c',c]) <*> (mkInteger d)

  In order to run this SMT script:

      main :: IO ()
      main = evalZ3 script >>= \mbSol ->
              case mbSol of
                   Nothing  -> error "No solution found."
                   Just sol -> putStr "Solution: " >> print sol
