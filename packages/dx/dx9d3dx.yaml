description: "# Installing\r\n\r\n You need need recentish ghc (6.4.x should work).\r\n
  DirectX should be installed somewhere, examples assume %DXSDK%\r\n \r\n First, you
  need to prepare mingw-usable import libraries for\r\n directx DLLS.  This is easiest
  with mingw tool reimp, available on\r\n mingw-utilities on mingw site ( www.mingw.org
  )  Installing\r\n mingw and msys are beyond this simple readme.\r\n \r\n Cabal setup
  scripts assume that those libraries are situated in\r\n %DXSDK%\\Mingw.  If you
  have mingw and msys installed, doing\r\n something like:\r\n \r\n   cd $DXSDK\r\n
  \  mkdir Mingw\r\n   cd Mingw\r\n   cp ../Lib/x86/*.lib .\r\n   rm DxErr*.lib\r\n
  \  ls | xargs -n 1 reimp\r\n  \r\n This will turn all but DxErr libs into mingw-compatible
  import\r\n libraries by running reimp on each .lib\r\n DxErr-libraries are not needed
  and take quite a lot of time to go\r\n through reimp.\r\n\r\n The bindings are split
  into multiple packages.  To compile and install\r\n packages, you need to compile
  Setup.hs\r\n \r\n  ghc --make Setup.hs -o setup\r\n  \r\n After you have setup.exe,
  you need to enter a package directory and\r\n give cabal commands configure, build
  and install.\r\n  cd base\r\n  ..\\setup configure --dx-sdk=%DXSDK%\r\n  ..\\setup
  build\r\n  ..\\setup install\r\n Recommended order to build packages is base, d3d,
  d3dx so that dependencies\r\n are met.\r\n\r\n"
