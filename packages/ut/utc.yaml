description: |-
  This library aims to supply you with common
  types and operations for working with time and date.

  * Parsing and rendering common formats like ISO8601 and RFC3339.

  * Modifying dates and times in a way that is easy to understand
  and not overengineered (srsly, who needs something else than the
  Gregorian Calendar?)

  * A set of classes that provide interfaces for your own application
  specific or maybe more efficient time and date types. Implement the
  interfaces and get all the parsing and rendering functions for free!

  Bug reports or (even better) tests are appreciated.
