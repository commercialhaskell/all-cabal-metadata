description: |-
  Various small helper functions for Lists, Maybes, Tuples, Functions.
  Some of these functions are improved implementations of standard functions.
  They have the same name as their standard counterparts.
  Others are equivalent to functions from the @base@ package,
  but if you import them from this utility package
  then you can write code that runs on older GHC versions
  or other compilers like Hugs and JHC.

  All modules are plain Haskell 98.
  The package depends exclusively on the @base@ package
  and only that portions of @base@ that are simple to port.
  Thus you do not risk a dependency avalanche by importing it.
  However, further splitting the base package might invalidate this statement.

  Alternative packages: @Useful@, @MissingH@
