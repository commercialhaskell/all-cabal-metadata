  Esotericbot is a sophisticated, lightweight IRC bot, written in Haskell.

  Esotericbot launches sub-processes to respond to commands issued by users over IRC.

  Why would you use esotericbot?

  For lambdabot-4.2.2.1:

  spoon@utensil:~/esotericbot$ ps e v

  PID TTY      STAT   TIME  MAJFL   TRS   DRS   RSS %MEM COMMAND

  23433 pts/3    Sl+    0:00      0  8228 84855 33476  1.6 lambdabot

  15040 pts/5    S+     0:00      0  2171 28804  3292  0.1 ./esotericbot

  I'm not insinuating that lambdabot sucks in any way, ( lambdabot is most excellent ) however, my hope is that esotericbot could attain equal functionality through plugins, while maintaining its small memory footprint.

  Esotericbot is small ( for Haskell :), designed to run on a server with limited memory - typically running at under 5mb of private memory.

  Features:

  * Advanced memory and time management options, utilizing POSIX resource management.

  For example, the memory used by all child processes, can be limited - commands be queued until the memory usage has dropped.

  * Privileged channel operator commands ( Currently, can be disabled and enabled by channel operators, to prevent abuse. )

  * Easy to add new plugins.  A C library is included to make writing new plugins/adapting programs to be plugins easy.

  * Set up through a configuration file.

  * Multiple channels.

  * Multi-threaded

  * Lightweight, typically running at under 5mb of private memory.

  Cons:

  * POSIX memory management, process forking, and chroot means that Esotericbot is POSIX only.

  * Esotericbot is, due to the libraries and extensions used, restricted to being compiled by the Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler.


  Note: esotericbot comes with several plugins which will be installed into your cabal-bin, and libraries installed into your cabal-lib.  Check cabal-bin for 'brainfuck', 'unlambda' , 'malbolge', 'sk' and 'whirl'.  These will need libplugin and libplugin++ from your cabal-lib to function correctly.
