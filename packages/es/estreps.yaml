  SYNOPSIS

      rselect - select a random set of sequences from a FASTA file.
      reps    - extract exact k-word repeats based that occur in
                sequences grouped in different clusters.


  INSTALLATION

      You'll need GHC or possibly another Haskell system, and the
      Haskell bioinformatics library.  The Makefile should work to
      build and install (by default to your home directory) the
      executables.

  USAGE

        rselect [-r] n [m] input.seq

      Selects n sequences from the file input.seq.  If the optional
      m is given, this limits the selection to happen only from the first
      m sequences in the file, which may be more efficient.  If -r is given,
      the sequences will be reoriented randomly.

      The selected sequences are written to standard output, so you
      probably want to redirect them to a file.

        reps k clustered.seq

      Generate a list of repeated k-words (or k-grams) found in the sequences.
      The sequences are expected to be on UniGene format, i.e. a FASTA file
      with #-initiated comments separating the clusters.

      A k-word is considered repeated if it is found in more than one of the
      clusters.

        reps k clustering.lst sequences.seq

      As above, but take a separate input clustering (and ignore any #'s in the
      sequences.  The clustering should consist of one line per cluster, with each
      line containing the sequence identifier (first word after the initial '>'
      in the FASTA header).
