  `mplayer-spot` saves your spot when watching movies with `mplayer`.

  ## Usage

  You can use `mplayer-spot` on the command line just as you would use `mplayer`:

  ```console
  $ mplayer-spot Dumb-and-Dumber.mp4
  ```

  This plays the movie just like `mplayer`.

  However, if you exit part-way through the movie by pressing <kbd>q</kbd>, `mplayer-spot`
  saves your current location.  Next time you play the same file, `mplayer-spot`
  looks up how far into the movie you watched, and starts playing from that
  position.


  If instance, if you stop the movie after 45 minutes, and play it again with
  `mplayer-spot`, it will start from the 45 minute mark.

  `mplayer-spot` is convenient if you often watch long movies in parts, and want
  an easy way to restart from where you left off.

  ## How Does `mplayer-spot` Work?

  `mplayer-spot` runs `mplayer` in verbose mode, and parses the current position
  in the movie.  When exiting, it saves the position in the `~/.mplayer-spot`
  directory.

  `mplayer-spot` references files by filename, so if you rename a file, you will
  not be able to restart from the same position.
