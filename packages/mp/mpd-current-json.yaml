changelog: |
  # v2.0.0.1
  - Fix internal use of function unsupported in `base` version <4.19.
  - Add `-O2` compilation flag to cabal file that benefits from v2.0 refactor.

  # v2.0
  - Major code rewrite.
  - Add command-line flags:
    - `-n`: is an alias for `--next`
    - `-nn`: is an alias for `--next-only`
    - `--next`: Include information about the next queued song in the
      output JSON.
    - `--next-only`: Print only the next queued song's information,
      replacing the `tags` object.
  - Add support for multi-value tags such as multiple artists. If a tag
    contains multiple values it should be displayed as an array in the
    output json.
  - Major performance increase.

  # v1.5.0.1
  - Fix `next_filename` to display correct filename URI.
    - It was using Id instead of Position. Position is a 0-indexed
      number, Id is 1-indexed and it was returning one song after the
      intended one in the playlist. Oops.

  # v1.5
  - Add json keys
    - `volume`: Integer for volume percentage
    - `crossfade`: Integer seconds of crossfase
    - `mixramp_db`: Decibels for MixRamp, can use float (decimals) number
    - `mixramp_delay`: Seconds of delay for MixRamp, can use float number
    - `updating_db`: Returns `true` when updading, not present otherwise
  - More code refactoring, prepping for v2 for more abstractions :p

  # v1.4.0
  - Add "`next_filename`" for getting next song file URI relative to the
    music library.

  # v1.3.2
  - Add "`next_position`", "`id`" and "`next_id`" keys to `playlist`.

  # v1.3.1
  - Move helper function `objectJson` to lib

  # v1.3
  - Add `filename` key.
  - Add `playlist` key and move existing keys to it.
  - Customize ordering of displayed output JSON.
  - Add cabal tested-with GHC versions

  # v1.2.0.0
  - Move literate Org Mode code to LITERATE.org file
  - Move functions from executable source Main.hs to their own library
  - Bump dependency versions for `aeson` and `bytestring`
  - Changed status.state from "play" to "playing" and "pause" to
    "paused".
    The reason why it was "play" and "pause" before was because
    that was the socket answer string.

  # v1.1.0.2
  [comment]: # (2023-10-23)
  - Fixed cabal `build-depends` version bounds for Arch Linux dynamic
    building.

  # v1.1.0.1
  [comment]: # (2023-10-17)
  - Added haddock comments
  - Addressed `cabal check` warnings;
  - setup for uploading as a Hackage package.

  # v1.1.0.0
  [comment]: # (2023-06-11)
  - Remove `-h` from `--help` and use `-h` for `--host`
  - Make `--help` option hidden in the help message

  # v1.0.0.0
  [comment]: # (2023-06-08)
  Initial working version
  - Added conditional tags printing, only non-empty values are printed
  - Accept host, port and password
  - Nested json objects for `status` and `tags`
  - Added `elapsed_percent` key shortcut for `elapsed / duration * 100`

  # v0.0.1.0
  [comment]: # (2023-06-01)
  - initial connection and parsing values
  - First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.
