changelog: |
  # v1.3
  - Add `filename` key.
  - Add `playlist` key and move existing keys to it.
  - Customize ordering of displayed output JSON.
  - Add cabal tested-with GHC versions

  # v1.2.0.0
  - Move literate Org Mode code to LITERATE.org file
  - Move functions from executable source Main.hs to their own library
  - Bump dependency versions for `aeson` and `bytestring`
  - Changed status.state from "play" to "playing" and "pause" to

    that was the socket answer string.
