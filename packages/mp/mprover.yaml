  mprover-0.0.0.0
  ---------------

  This is a highly preliminary release of MProver, a simple (I hope!) proof
  checker for equational reasoning in (a subset of) Haskell. It is released
  in the spirit, though not under the exact terms, of the CRAPL[1].

  To build and install, use the standard incantation, viz.:

    $ runhaskell Setup.hs configure
    $ runhaskell Setup.hs build
    $ runhaskell Setup.hs install

  To launch the REPL (note that loading modules for use in the REPL is not
  supported yet, so you may find this a bit useless):

    $ mp

  To run the proof checker against an example MProver script:

    $ mp examples/Test.hs

  If you have any questions or comments, please write:

    Adam Procter <amp269@mail.missouri.edu>

  In particular, I'd be glad to send you a draft copy of a conference paper,
  currently under review, that outlines MProver's design.

  Enjoy at your own risk!


  Bugs/Limitations
  ----------------

  Some particular bugs/limitations/to-do items of note:

    * The guardedness check is not implemented yet.
    * Program terms are not type checked (!)
    * Type classes are not implemented yet.
    * Case-proofs must be exhaustive; this is not actually checked for yet.
