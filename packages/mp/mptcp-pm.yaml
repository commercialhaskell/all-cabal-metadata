  [![Hackage][hk-img]][hk]

  This is a userspace path manager for the [linux multipath TCP
  kernel][mptcp-fork], starting from version v0.95.

  This allows to monitor MPTCP connections and control what subflows to create and
  with a custom kernel it can even set specific values for the congestion windows.


  # Compilation

  For now we need a custom version of netlink
  With a custom netlink and kernel
  Compile the custom netlink library with
  ```
  $ cabal configure --enable-library-profiling
  ```
  You may need some headers as well (NOTE: reference cabal.project instead):
  ```
  kernel $ make headers_install
  $ cabal configure --package-db ~/netlink-hs/dist/package.conf.inplace --extra-include-dirs=~/mptcp/build/usr/include -v3 --enable-profiling
  ```

  To compile the doc (and understand why HLS fails displaying anything)
  `cabal haddock --all`

  # Usage

  The netlink module asks for `GENL_ADMIN_PERM` which requires the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` privilege.
  You can assign this privilege via:

  ```
  sudo setcap cap_net_admin+ep hs/dist-newstyle/build/x86_64-linux/ghc-8.6.3/netlink-pm-1.0.0/x/daemon/build/daemon/daemon
  ```

  Enter the development shell and start the daemon:

  ```
  $ nix develop
  $ cabal run mptcp-manager
  ```

  # TODO
  - remove the need for MptcpSocket everywhere: it's just needed to write the
  header, which could be added/modifier later instead ! (to increase purity in the
      library)
  - we need to better keep track of subflow status (established vs WIP) ?
  - pass local/server IPs as commands to the PM ?
  - generate completion scripts via --zsh-completion-script
