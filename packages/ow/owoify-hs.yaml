description: "# owoify-hs\n\nTurning your worst nightmare into a Haskell package.\n\n[![Haskell
  CI](https://github.com/deadshot465/owoify-hs/actions/workflows/haskell.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/deadshot465/owoify-hs/actions/workflows/haskell.yml)\n\nThis
  is a Haskell port of [mohan-cao's owoify-js](https://github.com/mohan-cao/owoify-js),
  which will help you turn any string into nonsensical babyspeak similar to LeafySweet's
  infamous Chrome extension.\n\nJust like my other Owoify ports, three levels of owoness
  are available. Each level has been implemented using a discriminated union, so it
  should work like enums people are used to seeing in other imperative languages.\n\n1.
  **owo (default)**: The most vanilla one.\n2. **uwu**: The moderate one.\n3. **uvu**:
  Litewawwy unweadabwal.\nPlease refer to the original [owoify-js repository](https://github.com/mohan-cao/owoify-js)
  for more information.\n\nFunctional programming is fun, so of course I'll port it
  to FP languages. \U0001F61C\n\nAlso I love Haskell. ❤️\n\n## Reason for development\n\nBecause
  I love Haskell and currently Hackage doesn't have any owoify package yet. Also PureScript
  is influenced by Haskell and they have nearly the same syntax, so it doesn't make
  sense to have a PureScript port while not having a Haskell port.\n\nThe difference
  is that owoify-hs makes use of Haskell's lazy evaluation. `Data.Text.Lazy` is used
  instead of `Data.Text`. This *possibly* solved stack overflow problem with purescript-owoify
  when owoifying very long texts (i.e. chapter 1-20 of Tolstoy's *War and Peace*).
  The reason for using `Data.Text.Lazy.Text` instead of the good old `String` is because
  `Data.Text.Lazy.Text` and the eager version `Data.Text.Text` are meant for handling
  Unicode texts.\n\nHaving said that, you would need to do `Data.Text.Lazy.pack <text>`
  before passing the text to the `owoify` function.\n\n## Install instructions\n\nAdd
  `owoify-hs` to your `package.yaml` in your Stack project:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n-
  owoify-hs == 1.0.0.1\n```\n\nIf you are using Cabal, add the package the usual way.\n\n```bash\ncabal
  install owoify-hs\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nowoify-hs is implemented as a single function.
  You will need to provide a source string and a owoify level. Due to random number
  generator and regular expressions, the result will be inside `IO` monad, so you
  will also need to handle that.\n\n```haskell\nmodule MyAwesomeModule where\n\nimport
  Prelude\n\nimport Data.Owoify.Owoify (OwoifyLevel(..), owoify)\nimport Data.Text.Lazy
  (pack, unpack)\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n  owoResult <- owoify (pack \"This is
  the string to owo! Kinda cute, isn't it?\") Owo\n  uvuResult <- owoify (pack \"This
  is the string to owo! Kinda cute, isn't it?\") Uvu\n  -- `print` won't print out
  Unicode emojis correctly.\n  putStrLn $ unpack owoResult\n  putStrLn $ unpack uvuResult\n\n--
  Possible outputs:\n-- This is teh stwing two owo! Kinda cute, isn't it?\n-- fwis
  is teh stwing two owowouvu Kinda cuteowo isn't it?\n```\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nAs usual,
  I'm writing this package for both practicing and bots' needs. Performance is **NOT**
  guaranteed.\n\nThat being said, `Data.Text.Lazy` is used, so it should be able to
  handle both short texts and long texts without any problem.\n\n## See also\n\n-
