synopsis: Low-level functions for SMT-LIB-based interaction with SMT solvers.
changelog: "see also the changelogs of `smtlib-backends-tests`, `smtlib-backends-process`
  and \n`smtlib-backends-z3`\n\n# v0.2\n- split the `Process` module into its own
  library\n- rename `SMTLIB.Backends`'s `ackCommand` to `command_`\n- remove logging

description: |-
  This library provides an extensible interface for interacting with SMT solvers
  using SMT-LIB. The smtlib-backends-process provides a backend that runs solvers
  as external processes, and the smtlib-backends-z3 package provides a backend that
  uses inlined calls to Z3's C API.
