  # Changelog

  All notable changes to the smtlib-backends library will be documented in this
  file.

  The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
  and this project adheres to [PVP versioning](https://pvp.haskell.org/).

  The same stands for the changelogs of
  [smtlib-backends-tests](smtlib-backends-tests/CHANGELOG.md),
  [smtlib-backends-process](smtlib-backends-process/CHANGELOG.md) and
  [smtlib-backends-z3](smtlib-backends-z3/CHANGELOG.md), except the version
  numbers simply follow that of `smtlib-backends`.

  ## v0.3 _(2023-02-03)_

  ### Added
  - **(breaking change)** add a datatype `Backends.QueuingFlag` to set the queuing
    mode
    - the `initSolver` function now takes this datatype as argument instead of a
      boolean
  - **(breaking change)** add a `send_` method to the `Backends.Backend` datatype
    for sending commands with no output
  - add a `Backends.flushQueue` function for forcing the content of the queue to
    be evaluated

  ### Changed
  - **(breaking change)** make the queuing functions thread-unsafe but faster

  ## v0.2 _(2022-12-16)_

  ### Changed
  - split the `Process` module into its own library
  - rename `SMTLIB.Backends`'s `ackCommand` to `command_`
  - improve read-me

  ### Removed
  - remove logging abilities
    - the user can always surround `command` or `command_` with their own logging
      functions

description: |-
  This library provides an extensible interface for interacting with SMT solvers
  using SMT-LIB. The smtlib-backends-process package provides a backend that
  runs solvers as external processes, and the smtlib-backends-z3 package
  provides a backend that uses inlined calls to Z3's C API.
