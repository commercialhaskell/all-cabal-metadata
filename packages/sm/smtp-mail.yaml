changelog: "# CHANGELOG\n\nThis package follows the Package Versioning Policy.\nRoughly
  speaking, this means that we have four digits standing for:\n\n- Major: A significant
  rewrite of the library.\n- Major: A breaking change\n- Minor: A non-breaking addition\n-
  Patch: A non-breaking bugfix\n\n## Upcoming\n\nIf you are doing a pull-request,
  please update this list.\nA template is provided:\n\n```\n- [# PR number](URL to
  pr) @your_github_username\n  - Describe change #1\n  - Describe change #2\n  - Indicate
  if changes are major, minor, or patch changes.\n```\n\n## 0.3.0.0\n\n- [#32](https://github.com/jhickner/smtp-mail/pull/32)
  @typetetris\n    - add some functions to use SMTPS, which should be preferred to\n
  \     STARTTLS for mail submissions of endusers according to RFC 8314\n    - add
  STARTTLS\n    - add integration test using nixos tests\n\n- [#30](https://github.com/jhickner/smtp-mail/pull/30)
  @typetetris\n    - Replace `cryptohash` dependency with `cryptonite`.\n      `cryptohash`
  is deprecated and `cryptonite` offers HMAC MD5\n      directly.\n\n## 0.2.0.0\n\n-
  [#25](https://github.com/jhickner/smtp-mail/pull/25) @shulhi\n    - References to
  the deprecated `Network` module were removed and replaced \n      with the new `connection`
  package. \n    - Duplicate functionality was deprecated.\n- [#23](https://github.com/jhickner/smtp-mail/pull/23)
  @alexandersgreen\n    - The `Cc` and `Bcc` fields will be sent to the SMTP server,
  and they'll \n      actually be sent now. \n"

description: "SMTP-MAIL\n=========\n\nMaking it easy to send SMTP emails from Haskell.\n\n```\ncabal
  install smtp-mail\n```\n\n### Sending with an SMTP server\n\n```haskell\n{-# LANGUAGE
  OverloadedStrings #-}\n\nimport Network.Mail.SMTP\n\nfrom       = Address Nothing
  \"email@domain.com\"\nto         = [Address (Just \"Jason Hickner\") \"email@domain.com\"]\ncc
  \        = []\nbcc        = []\nsubject    = \"email subject\"\nbody       = plainTextPart
  \"email body\"\nhtml       = htmlPart \"<h1>HTML</h1>\"\n\nmail = simpleMail from
  to cc bcc subject [body, html]\n\nmain = sendMail host mail\n```\n\nor with an attachment:\n\n```haskell\nmain
  = do\n  attachment <- filePart \"application/octet-stream\" \"path/to/attachment.zip\"\n
  \ let mail = simpleMail from to cc bcc subject [body, html, attachment]\n  sendMail
  host mail\n```\n\nor, with authentication:\n\n```haskell\nmain = sendMailWithLogin
  host user pass mail\n```\n\nor, using STARTTLS:\n\n```haskell\nmain = sendMailSTARTTLS
  host mail\n```\n\nor, using SMTPS:\n\n```haskell\nmain = sendMailTLS host mail\n```\n\nNote:
  `sendMail'` and `sendMailWithLogin'` variations are also provided if you want to
  specify a port as well as a hostname.\n\n\n### Sending with sendmail\n\nIf you'd
  like to use sendmail, the sendmail interface from ```Network.Mail.Mime``` \nis reexported
  as well:\n\n```haskell\n-- send via the default sendmail executable with default
  options\nrenderSendMail mail\n\n-- send via the specified executable with specified
  options\nrenderSendMailCustom filepath [opts] mail\n```\n\nFor more complicated
  scenarios or for adding attachments or CC/BCC\naddresses you can import ```Network.Mail.Mime```
  and construct ```Mail```\nobjects manually.\n\n### Thanks\n\nThis library is based
  on code from HaskellNet, which appears to be no longer\nmaintained. I've cleaned
  up the error handling, added some API functions to\nmake common operations easier,
  and switched to ByteStrings where applicable.\n\n### Developing\n\n`nix-integration-test/integration-test.nix`
  contains a integration test, which\nuses nixos qemu vm tests to start a qemu vm
  with a postfix and use smtp-mail to\nsend mails to that postfix.\n\nInstall [nix](https://nixos.org)
  and execute `nix-build nix-integration-test/integration-test.nix`\nto execute the
  test. Success is signalled by a return code of `0`.\n\nUnconveniently it can't be
  run via github actions or travis, as it needs kvm virtualization.\n"
