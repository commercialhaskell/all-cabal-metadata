  Smuggler2 is a Haskell GHC Source Plugin that automatically

  - rewrites module imports to produce a minimal set. This may make code easier to
    read because the provenance of imported names is explcit.

  - adds or replaces explicit exports to produce a maximalist set for hand
    pruning. All values, types and classes defined in a module are exported
    (excluding those that are imported). It does not check whether an exported
    name is used elsewhere in your package. Limiting exports may make it easier
    for `ghc` to optimise some code.

  While writing code, it may be convenient to import a complete module (by not
  specifiying what is to be imported from it) and then get Smuggler2 to limit the
  import to include only the names that are used.

  ## How to use

  Install `smuggler2` using `cabal install --lib smuggler2`.

  If you also want the `ghc` wrapper, install it using `cabal install exe:smuggler2`.

  ### Adding Smuggler2 to your dependencies

  Add `smuggler2` to the dependencies of your project and to your compiler flags.
  For example, you could include in your project `cabal` file something like

  ```Cabal
  flag smuggler2
    description: Rewrite sources to cleanup imports, and create explicit exports
    exports
    default:     False
    manual:      True

  common smuggler-options
    if flag(smuggler2)
      ghc-options: -fplugin=Smuggler2.Plugin
      build-depends: smuggler2 >= 0.3 && < 0.4
  ```

  and then `import: smuggler-options` in the appropriate `library` or `executable`
  sections.

  The use of the flag allows you to build with or without source processing. Eg,

  ```bash
  $ cabal build -fsmuggler2
  ```

  using the example above.

  You might use this approach to refine your imports or get a starting point for
  your exports, but not rewrite them every time you compile. The use of a flag
  means that you can also exclude `smuggler2` dependencies from your final builds.

  ### Alternatively, using a local version

  If you have installed `smuggler2` from a local copy of this repository, you may
  need to add `-package smuggler2` to your `ghc-options` if you did not
  install using the `--lib` flag to `cabal install`.

  ### Or use a `ghc` wrapper

  The `smuggler2` package provides an executable `ghc-smuggler2` that calls `ghc`
  with the `-fplugin=Smuggler2.Plugin` argument (followed by any others that you
  supply). This allows you to run the plugin over your sources without modifying
  your `.cabal` file:

  ```bash
  $ cabal build -with-compiler=ghc-smuggler2
  ```

  or just

  ```bash
  $ cabal build -w ghc-smuggler2
  ```

  ## Options

  `Smuggler2` has several (case-insensitive) options, which can be set by adding
  `-fplugin-opt=Smuggler2.Plugin:` flags to your `ghc-options`

  - `NoImportProcessing` - do no import processing
  - `PreserveInstanceImports` - remove unused imports, but preserve a library
    import stub. such as `import Mod ()`, to import only instances of typeclasses
    from it. (The default.)
  - `MinimiseImports` - remove unused imports, including any that may be needed
    only to import typeclass instances. This may, therefore, stop the module from
    compiling.

  - `NoExportProcessing` - do no export processing
  - `AddExplicitExports` - add an explicit list of all available exports
    (excluding those that are imported) if there is no existing export list. (The
    default.) You may want to edit it to keep specific values, types or classes
    local to the module. At present, a typeclass and its class methods are
    exported individually. You may want to replace those exports with an
    abbreviation such as `C(..)`.
  - `ReplaceExports` - replace any existing module export list with one containing
    all available exports (which, again, you can, of course, then prune to your
    requirements).

  Any other option value is used to generate a source file with a new extension of
  the option value (`new` in the following example) rather than replacing the
  original file.

  ```Cabal
      ghc-options: -fplugin=Smuggler2.Plugin -fplugin-opt=Smuggler2.Plugin:new
  ```

  This will create output files with a `.new` suffix rather the overwriting the
  originals.

  Smuggler2 tries not to change files when there is no work to do.
  So you can just run `ghcid` as usual:

  ```bash
  $ ghcid --command='cabal repl'
  ```

  ## Caveats

  Because `cabal` and `ghc` don't have full support for distinguishing dependent
  packages from plug-ins you will probably want to ensure that the build
  dependencies for your project are installed into your local package db first,
  before enabling sumuggler, otherwise they will all be processed by it too,
  as your project builds, which should do no harm, but will increase your build time.

  `Smuggler2` is robust -- it can chew through the
  [Agda](https://github.com/agda/agda) codebase of over 370 modules with complex
  interdependencies and be tripped over by only

  - a couple of ambiguous exports (are we trying to export something defined in
    the current module or something with the same name from an imported module)
  - and a couple of imports where both qualifed and unqualifed version of the
    module are imported and there are references to both qualified and unqualifed
    version of the same names
  - some qualified record fields are overlooked

  But there are some caveats, most of which are either easy enough to work around
  (and still offer the benefit of a great reduction in keyboard work):

  - `Smuggler2` rewrites the existing imports, rather than attempting to prune
    them. (This is a more aggressive approach than `smuggler` which focuses on
    removing redundant imports.) It has advantages and disadvantages.
    The advantage is that a minimal set of imports is generated in a reproducable
    format. So you can just import a library without specifying any specific
    imports and `Smuggler2` will add an explict list of things that are
    used from it. This can be a useful check and better document your modules.
    The disdvantage is that imports may be reordered, comments and
    blank lines dropped, external imports mixed with external, etc.

  - By default `Smuggler2` does not remove imports completely because an import
    may be being used to only import instances of typeclasses, So it will leave
    stubs like

    ```haskell
    import Mod ()
    ```

    that you may want to remove manually. Alternatively use the `MinimiseImports`
    option to remove them anyway, at the risk of producing code that fails to
    compile.

  - CPP files will not be processed correctly: the imports will be generated for
    current CPP settings and any CPP annotations in the import block will be
    discarded. This may be a particular problem if you are writing code for
    several generations of `ghc` and `base` for example. Nevetheless, `Smuggler2`
    will generate a new CPP preprocessed output file with a `-cpp` suffix.
    [retrie](https://github.com/facebookincubator/retrie/blob/master/Retrie/CPP.hs)
    solves this problem generating all possible versions of the module
    (exponential in the number of `#if` directives), operating on each version
    individually, and splicing results back into the original file. A tour de
    force!

  - `smuggler2` depends on the current `ghc` compiler and `base` library to check
    whether an import is redundant. Different versions of the compiler may, of
    course, need different slightly imports, typically from `base`. The
    [base library changelog](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/changelog)
    provides some details of what was made available when.

  - Multiple separate import lines referring to the same library are not
    consolidated

  - Literate Haskell `.lhs` files will procssed into ordinary haskell files a
    `-lhs` suffix.

  * `hiding` clauses may not be properly analysed. So hiding things that are not
    used may not be spotted.

  * The test suite does not seem to run reliably on Windows. This is probably more
    of an issue with the way that the tests are run, than `Smuggler2` itself.

  * Currently `cabal` does not have a particular way of specifying plugins. (See,
    eg, https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/11244 and
    https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/2965) which would allow cleaner
    separation of user code and plugin-code

  ## For contributors

  Requirements:

  - `ghc-8.6.5`, `ghc-8.8.3` and `ghc-8.10.1`: `Smuggler2` will not compile with
    earlier versions.
  - The test golden values are for `ghc-8.10.1` and `ghc-8.8.3`. Some of them fail
    on `ghc-8.6.5` because it seems to need to import `Data.Bool` whereas later
    versions of GHC don't. The results compile on `ghc-8.6.5` and later anyway,
    but the imports are not as minimal for later versions as they could be.
  - `cabal >= 3.0` (ideally `3.2`)

  ### How to build

  ```shell
  $ cabal update
  $ cabal build
  ```

  To build with debugging:

  ```shell
  $ cabal build -fdebug
  ```

  Curently this just adds an `-fdump-minimal-imports` parameter to GHC
  compilation.

  ### How to run tests

  There is a `tasty-golden`-based test suite that can be run by

  ```shell
  $ cabal test smuggler-test --enable-tests
  ```

  Further help can be found by

  ```shell
  $ cabal run smuggler-test -- --help
  ```

  (note the extra `--`)

  For example, if you are running on `ghc-8.6.5` you can

  ```shell
  $ cabal run smuggler2-test -- --accept
  ```

  to update the golden outputs to the current results of (failing) tests.

  It is sometimes necessary to run `cabal clean` before running tests to ensure
  that old build artefacts do not lead to misleading results.

  `smuggler-test` uses `cabal exec ghc` internally to run a test. The `cabal`
  command that is to be used to do that can be set using the `CABAL` environment
  variable. This may be helpful for certain workflows where `cabal` is not in the
  current path, or you want to add extra flags to the `cabal` command.

  The test suite does not seem to run reliably on Windows

  Importing a test module from another test module in the same directory is likely
  to lead to race conditions as 'Tasty' runs tests in parallel and so will try to
  generate the same `smuggler2` output both when the imported module is being
  tested directly and when it is being processed when the importing module is
  being tested. Put the imported module in a subdirectory to avoid this issue, as
  the test harness only looks for tests in `test\tests` and not its
  subdirectories.

  ## Implementation approach

  `smuggler2` uses the `ghc-exactprint`
  [library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-exactprint) to modiify the
  source code. The documentation for the library is fairly spartan, and the
  library is not widely used, at least in publicly available code, so the use here
  can, no doubt, be optimised.

  The library is needed because the annotated AST that GHC generates does not have
  enough information to reconstitute the original source. Some parts of the
  renamed syntax tree (for example, imports) are not found in the typechecked one.
  `ghc-exactprint` provides parsers that preserve this information, which is
  stored in a separate `Anns` `Map` used to generate properly formatted source
  text.

  To make manipulation of GHC's AST and `ghc-exactprint`'s `Anns` easier,
  `ghc-exactprint` provides a set of Transform functions. These are intended to
  facilitate making changes to the AST and adjusting the `Anns` to suit the
  changes.

  > These functions are
  > [said to be under heavy development](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-exactprint-0.6.3/docs/Language-Haskell-GHC-ExactPrint-Transform.html).
  > It is not entirely obvious how they are intended to be used or composed. The
  > approach provided by [`retrie`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/retrie)
  > wraps an AST and `Anns` into a single type that seems to make AST
  > transformations easier to compose and reduces the risk of the `Anns` and AST
  > getting out of sync as it is being transformed, something with which the type
  > system doesn't help you since the `Anns` are stored as a `Map`.

  ### Imports

  `smuggler2` uses GHC to generate a set of minimal imports. It

  - parses the original file
  - dumps the minimal exports that GHC generates and parses them back in (to pick
    up the annotations needed for printing)
  - drops implicit imports (such as Prelude) and, optionally, imports that are for
    instances only
  - replaces the original imports with minimal ones
  - `exactPrint`s the result back over the original file (or one with a different
    suffix, if that was specified as option to `smuggler2`)

  This round tripping is needed because the AST that `ghc` provides does not have
  enough information in it to reconstitute the source (which is why
  `ghc-exactprint` exists).

  ### Exports

  Exports are simpler to deal with as GHC's `exports_from_avail` does the work.

  ## Other projects

  - Smuggler2 was is a rewrite of
    [`smuggler`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/smuggler)
  - `retrie` a [code modding tool](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/retrie)
    that works with GHC 8.10.1
  - `refact-global-hse` an ambitious
    [import refactoring tool](https://github.com/ddssff/refact-global-hse). This
    uses `haskell-src-exts` rather than `ghc-exactprint` and so may not work with
    current versions of GHC.
  - These blog posts contain some fragments on the topic of using `ghc-exactprint`
    to manipulate import lists
    [Terser import declarations](https://www.machinesung.com/scribbles/terser-import-declarations.html)
    and [GHC API](https://www.machinesung.com/scribbles/ghc-api.html) (The site
    doesn't always seem to be up.)
