  The changes are recorded by the version control system, Darcs. To see a log
  quickly from the terminal, run:

    $ darcs changes --repo http://darcs.rel4tion.org/repos/smaoin

  There is also a web interface at <http://darcs.rel4tion.org> which, among other
  things, can display the history log.

  To see the log in a local clone, first get a copy of the repository if you
  haven't yet:

    $ darcs get http://darcs.rel4tion.org/repos/smaoin

  Then move into the newly created directory and run darcs:

    $ cd smaoin
    $ darcs changes
