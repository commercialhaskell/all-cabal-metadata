changelog: ! 'Changes

  =======


  Version 1.1.4

  -------------


  * Add instances for fixed-width Int and Word types (Int8, Word8 etc.)


  Version 1.1.3.1

  ---------------


  * Fix compatibility with GHC 7.8 and older


  Version 1.1.3

  -------------


  * Add `Serial` and `CoSerial` instances for `Word` and `Natural`


  Version 1.1.2

  -------------


  * Export the `test` function

  * Add a `listSeries` function


  Version 1.1.1

  -------------


  Export some auxiliary functions from `T.S.Series`, and document how to express

  `consN` and `altsN` for `N > 4`.


  Version 1.1.0.1

  ---------------


  Documentation fixes


  Version 1.1

  -----------


  * Add a `Serial` instance for `Ratio`

  * Add the `NonEmpty` wrapper for lists

  * Add `listM` (the monadic version of `list`)

  * Add optional explanation for test outcomes


  Version 1.0.4

  -------------


  Fix compatibility with GHC 7.4.1


  Version 1.0.3

  -------------


  Fix a bug where no test cases were generated for some functional types (#19).


  Version 1.0.2

  -------------


  Fix a bug in the generic instance


  Version 1.0.1

  -------------


  Make SmallCheck build with GHC 7.4


  Version 1.0

  -----------


  This is a major incompatible release of SmallCheck. Virtually every function has

  changed its name, type, semantics or module. So please carefully read the docs

  when upgrading.


  For some highlights, see [this blog post](http://ro-che.info/articles/2013-02-19-smallcheck.html).


  Version 0.6.2

  -----------

  * Derive Typeable Property instance

  * Add smallCheckPure


  Version 0.6.1

  -----------


  * Documentation improvements

  * Make the package build with GHC 7.4.1


  Version 0.6

  -----------


  * Default Generic implementation of Serial instance (by Bas van Dijk)

  * The code is split into modules

  * Convert much of README into haddock documentation

  * Many small API changes

  * Remove impure Testable (IO a) instance


  Version 0.5

  -----------


  Make the package build with GHC 7.2. Some cosmetic changes.


  Version 0.4

  -----------


  The module SmallCheck is now Test.SmallCheck.  Packaged with Cabal.


  Version 0.3

  -----------


  Existential quantifiers now have unique variants for which two witnesses

  are reported when uniqueness fails.  The over-generating coseries method

  for functions of functional arguments has been replaced; now ''coseries''

  and the ''alts<N>'' family take a series argument. Test counters are

  now Integers, not Ints.  Ord and Eq are now derived for the N types.

  Examples extended.


  Version 0.2

  -----------


  The ''smallCheck'' driver now takes an argument d and runs test series

  at depths 0..d without interaction, stopping if any test fails.

  The interactive variant is still available as ''smallCheckI''.  All

  Prelude numeric types now have Serial instances, including floating-point

  types. Serial types Nat and Natural are also defined.  Examples extended.


  Version 0.1

  -----------


  The differences from 0.0 are two fixes (space-fault, output buffering),

  an ''unsafe'' but sometimes useful Testable (IO a) instance and additional

  examples.

description: ! "SmallCheck: a property-based testing library for Haskell\n========================================================\n\nSmallCheck
  is a testing library that allows to verify properties for all test\ncases up to
  some depth. The test cases are generated automatically by\nSmallCheck.\n\nUsefulness
  of such an approach to testing is based on the following observation:\n\n> If a
  program fails to meet its specification in some cases, it almost always\n> fails
  in some simple case.\n\nTo get started with SmallCheck:\n\n* Read the [documentation][haddock]\n*
  If you have experience with QuickCheck, [read the comparison of QuickCheck and SmallCheck][comparison]\n*
  Install it and give it a try!  \n  `cabal update; cabal install smallcheck`\n* Read
  the [paper][paper] or [other materials][oldpage] from the original\n  authors of
  SmallCheck (note that that information might be somewhat outdated)\n* If you see
  something that can be improved, please [submit an issue][issues]\n* Check out [the
  source code][github] at GitHub\n\n[haddock]: http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/smallcheck/latest/doc/html/Test-SmallCheck.html\n[hackage]:
