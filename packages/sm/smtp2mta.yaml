description: |
  This is a simple SMTP server that forwards all mail to a
  sendmail-compatible script.

  The primary intended use is to allow broken MUAs that expect to always
  send over SMTP to send with a standard MTA script.  (This allows one
  to authenticate with a mailserver using SSH keys, for example.)

  smtp2mta can be run as a standalone server, or can serve connections
  from behind inetd.
