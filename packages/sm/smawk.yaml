  [![Hackage][hackage-shield]][hackage]

  This package implements the SMAWK algorithm by
  [Peter Shor, Shlomo Moran, Alok Aggarwal, Robert Wilber and Maria Klawe][smawk]
  for finding the minimum value in each row of an implicitly defined totally monotone matrix.

  This has many applications in computational geometry, such as finding the farthest point
  from each point in a convex polygon, finding optimal enclosing polygon. It can also be
  used to implement paragraph line breaking in a manner analogous to Knuth and Platt, but in
  linear time. It also has uses in RNA secondary structure prediction, various sequence
  alignment problems, construction of prefix codes, image thresholding, etc.
