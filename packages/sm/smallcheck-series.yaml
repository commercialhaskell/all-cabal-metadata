  # Change Log
  All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This file
  follows the formatting recommendations from [Keep a
  CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/). This project adheres to [Semantic
  Versioning](http://semver.org/).

  ## [0.6.1] - 2019-02-17
  ### Fixed
  - `base` version bump to `4.13`.
  - Conditionally exclude instances already supported by `smallcheck-1.1.3`.

  ### Added
  - Support for `base-4.9` which comes bundled with `GHC-8.0.1`.

  ### Removed
  - Support for `GHC-7.8.4`. For some reason with this version the `transformers`
    dependency is pinned to 0.3.0.0. I don't have time to fix this issue but if
    you know how to fix it PRs are welcome.
  - Support for stack.

  ## [0.5.1] - 2015-09-01
  ### Fixed
  - Intances of `Word` and `Int` now stop generating at its maxium bound.

  ## [0.5] - 2015-08-31
  ### Changed
  - `Text` and `ByteString` Serial instances are now exhaustive.

  ### Added
  - `Serial` and `CoSerial` instances for `Word`, `Word8`, `Int16`.
  - `Serial` and `CoSerial` instances for `Int8`, `Int16`.

  ## [0.4] - 2015-08-06
  ### Added
  - Support for stack.
  - `CoSerial` instances.

  ## [0.3] - 2015-05-25
  ### Added
  - Serial instance for `Map`.
  - `zipLogic` for *zipping* instances. Thanks to Roman Cheplyaka
    [@feuerbach](https://github.com/feuerbach).

  ### Fixed
  - Compatibility with GHC < 7.10.

  ## [0.2] - 2015-04-28
  ### Changed
  - General renaming to, hopefully, make functions more clear.
  ### Fixed

    reporting this issue.

  ## [0.1] - 2015-04-27
  ### Added
  - Initial set of utilities for creating `ByteString` and `Text` `Series`.
  - `Serial` `ByteString` and `Text` instances.
