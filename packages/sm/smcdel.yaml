  A symbolic model checker for [Dynamic Epistemic Logic](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dynamic-epistemic).

  You can find a complete literate Haskell documentation in the file

  ## Online

  You can try SMCDEL online here: https://w4eg.de/malvin/illc/smcdelweb/


  ## Dependencies

  - [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)
  - [dot2tex](https://github.com/kjellmf/dot2tex)

  On Debian, just do `sudo apt install graphviz dot2tex`.


  ## Basic usage

  1) Use *stack* from https://www.stackage.org

  - `stack build` will compile everything. This might fail if one of
    the BDD packages written in C and C++ is missing. In this case,
    install those manually and then try `stack build` again.

  - `stack install` will put two executables `smcdel` and `smcdel-web`
    into ~/.local/bin which should be in your `PATH` variable.

  2) Create a text file `MuddyShort.smcdel.txt` which describes the knowledge structure and the formulas you want to check for truth or validity:

      ```
      -- Three Muddy Children in SMCDEL
      VARS 1,2,3
      LAW  Top
      OBS  alice: 2,3
           bob:   1,3
           carol: 1,2
      WHERE?
        [ ! (1|2|3) ] alice knows whether 1
      VALID?
        [ ! (1|2|3) ]
        [ ! ((~ (alice knows whether 1)) & (~ (bob knows whether 2)) & (~ (carol knows whether 3))) ]
        [ ! ((~ (alice knows whether 1)) & (~ (bob knows whether 2)) & (~ (carol knows whether 3))) ]
        (alice,bob,carol) comknow that (1 & 2 & 3)
      ```

  3) Run `smcdel MuddyShort.smcdel.txt` resulting in:

      ```
      >> smcdel MuddyShort.smcdel.txt
      SMCDEL 1.0 by Malvin Gattinger -- https://github.com/jrclogic/SMCDEL

      At which states is ... true?
      []
      [1]

      Is ... valid on the given structure?
      True
      ```

      More example files are in the folder [Examples](https://github.com/jrclogic/SMCDEL/tree/master/Examples).

  4) To use the web interface run `smcdel-web` and then open <http://localhost:3000/index.html>.


  ## Advanced usage

  To deal with more complex models and formulas, use SMCDEL as a Haskell module.

  Examples can be found in the folders
    [src/SMCDEL/Examples](https://github.com/jrclogic/SMCDEL/tree/master/src/SMCDEL/Examples)
  and
    [bench](https://github.com/jrclogic/SMCDEL/tree/master/bench).


  ## Used BDD packages

  SMCDEL can be used with different BDD packages. To compile and
  run the benchmarks you will have to install all of them.

  - [Data.HasCacBDD](https://github.com/m4lvin/HasCacBDD) which runs CacBDD from <http://kailesu.net/CacBDD/>
  - [Cudd](https://github.com/davidcock/cudd) ([with some patches](https://github.com/m4lvin/cudd))
