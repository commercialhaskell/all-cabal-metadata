  Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/jrclogic/SMCDEL.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jrclogic/SMCDEL)\n\nA
  symbolic model checker for Dynamic Epistemic Logic.\n\nYou can find a complete literate
  Haskell documentation in the file\n[SMCDEL.pdf](https://github.com/jrclogic/SMCDEL/raw/master/SMCDEL.pdf).\n\n##

  Gattinger:\n*Towards Symbolic Factual Change in DEL.*\nESSLLI 2017 student session,\n2017](https://w4eg.de/malvin/illc/2017-07-symbolicfactualchange.pdf).\n\n##
  Online\n\nYou can try SMCDEL online here: https://w4eg.de/malvin/illc/smcdelweb/\n\n\n##
  Dependencies\n\n- [graphviz](http://graphviz.org/)\n- [dot2tex](https://github.com/kjellmf/dot2tex)\n\nOn
  Debian, just do `sudo apt install graphviz dot2tex`.\n\n\n## Basic usage\n\n1) Use
  *stack* from https://www.stackage.org\n\n- `stack build` will compile everything.
  This might fail if one of\n  the BDD packages written in C and C++ is missing. In
  this case,\n  install those manually and then try `stack build` again.\n\n- `stack
  install` will put two executables `smcdel` and `smcdel-web`\n  into ~/.local/bin
  which should be in your `PATH` variable.\n\n2) Create a text file which describes
  the knowledge structure and\nthe formulas you want to check for truth or validity:\n\n
  \   ```\n    -- Three Muddy Children in SMCDEL\n    VARS 1,2,3\n    LAW  Top\n    OBS
  \ alice: 2,3\n         bob:   1,3\n         carol: 1,2\n    WHERE?\n      [ ! (1|2|3)
  ] alices knows whether 1\n    VALID?\n      [ ! (1|2|3) ]\n      [ ! ((~ (alice
  knows whether 1)) & (~ (bob knows whether 2)) & (~ (carol knows whether 3))) ]\n
  \     [ ! ((~ (alice knows whether 1)) & (~ (bob knows whether 2)) & (~ (carol knows
  whether 3))) ]\n      (alice,bob,carol) comknow that (1 & 2 & 3)\n    ```\n\n3)
  Run \"smcdel textfile\" resulting in:\n\n    ```\n    >> smcdel MuddyShort.smcdel.txt\n
  \   SMCDEL 1.0 by Malvin Gattinger -- https://github.com/jrclogic/SMCDEL\n\n    At
  which states is ... true?\n    []\n    [1]\n\n    Is ... valid on the given structure?\n
  \   True\n    ```\n\nMore example files are in the folder [Examples](https://github.com/jrclogic/SMCDEL/tree/master/Examples).\n\n\n##
  Advanced usage\n\nTo deal with more complex models and formulas, use SMCDEL as a
  Haskell module.\n\nExamples can be found in `Examples.hs` and the `Bench` folder.\n\n\n##
  Used BDD packages\n\nSMCDEL can be used with different BDD packages. To compile
  and\nrun the benchmarks you will have to install all of them.\n\n- [Data.HasCacBDD](https://github.com/m4lvin/HasCacBDD)
  which runs CacBDD from <http://kailesu.net/CacBDD/>\n- [Cudd](https://github.com/davidcock/cudd)
  ([with some patches](https://github.com/m4lvin/cudd))\n\n\n## Experimental Stuff\n\n`SMCDEL.Other.NonS5`
  implements general knowledge structures. They are\nequivalent to Kripke models which
  are not based on equivalence relations.\n"
