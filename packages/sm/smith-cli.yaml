  # smith-cli

  This is a command line interface for the [Smith](https://smith.st).

  The goal is to provide a convenient interface for working with smith.

  ### Configuration

  The smith cli will source credentials configuration as follows:
   - It will check for an environment provided API key in '$SMITH_JWK'.
   - It will fall-back to looking for '$SMITH_HOME/credentials.json' if '$SMITH_HOME' is set.
   - It will fall-back to looking for '$HOME/.smith/credentials.json'.

  The smith cli will source endpoint configuration as follows:
   - It will check for an environment provided endpoint in '$SMITH_ENDPOINT'.
   - It will fall-back to the public production endpoint 'https://api.smith.st'.


  ### Stability

  This cli is new, and should have the disclaimers that normally comes
  with that. However, the command line aims to maintain compatibility
  unless there is a non-small issue that breaking compatibility will
  really address. Stable versions will always be available for
  downoad/install if you really need to lock things down.


  ### Example

  Using your ssh-agent.
  ```
  # using ssh agent
  eval $(ssh-agent)

  # issue a certificate for the muppets environment
  smith --environment muppets
  smith -e muppets
  ```

  Using smith to start ssh-agent.
  ```
  # start ssh-agent issue a certificate for the muppets environment
  eval $(smith --environment muppets)
  ```

  Running a command with access to an agent configured with your certificate.
  ```
  # start ssh-agent issue a certificate for the muppets environment
  smith --environment muppets -- ssh user@kermit
  smith --environment muppets -- rsync -aH www www@gonzo:/var/www
  ```
