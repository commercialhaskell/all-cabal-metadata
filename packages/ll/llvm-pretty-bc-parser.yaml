  # Revision history for llvm-pretty-bc-parser

  ## 0.4.1.0 (January 2024)

  * Add preliminary support for LLVM versions up through 16.
  * Require building with `llvm-pretty-0.12.*`.
  * Add preliminary support for parsing opaque pointers. For now,
    `llvm-pretty-bc-parser` will still fill in the types of certain instructions
    with non-opaque pointer types (e.g., the type of memory to store in a `store`
    instruction), so be wary of this if you are parsing a bitcode file that
    contains opaque pointers. See also the discussion in
    https://github.com/GaloisInc/llvm-pretty-bc-parser/issues/262.
  * Improve the runtime performance of the parser.
  * A variety of bugfixes. Some notable fixes include:
    * Fix a bug in which the parser would fail to parse `DIDerivedType` nodes
      produced by Apple Clang on macOS.
    * Fix a bug in which the DWARF address space field of a `DIDerivedType` node
      was parsed incorrectly.
    * Fix a bug in which constant `fcmp`/`icmp` expressions would parse their
      operands incorrectly.

  # llvm-pretty-bc-parser

  A parser for the LLVM bitcode file format, yielding a `Module` from
  [the llvm-pretty package](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/llvm-pretty).

  ## Compatibility

  The following table shows what kinds of tests have been/are being run with which
  compilers.

   - A check in the the randomized tests column indicates that such tests are
     regularly run [in Github Actions][fuzz-workflow].
   - A check in the manual tests column indicates that the parser seems to work on
     some code that was generated by this compiler.
