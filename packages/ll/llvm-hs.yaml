synopsis: General purpose LLVM bindings
changelog: |
  ## 9.0.0 (2019-09-06)

  * Support GHC 8.8
  * Update to LLVM 9.0
    * Note that this is the last LLVM release that supports the current
      OrcJIT APIs and `llvm-hs` does not yet have bindings for OrcJIT
      V2. If you are interested in working on that please get in
      touch. See https://github.com/llvm-hs/llvm-hs/issues/276 for more
      details.
    * The `sanitizeAddresses` field from `MachineCodeOptions` has been
      removed following a change in LLVM.
    * The `MemorySanitizer` now has two new options `kernel` and
      `recover` matching the options in LLVM.


  ## 8.1.0

  * Change `withHostTargetMachine` to accept the code model, relocation model,
    and optimization level as arguments. The old behaviour is available
    under the name `withHostTargetMachineDefault`.

  ## 8.0.0 (2019-03-10)

  * Upgrade to LLVM 8
  * It is now possible to define multiple variables with an empty name
    without causing a name collision. Variables with an empty name
    cannot be referenced. This fixes an issue caused by using
    IRBuilder’s `extern` helper.

  ## 7.0.1 (2018-09-29)

  * Support llvm-config executables named `llvm-config-7` in addition to
    `llvm-config-7.0` and `llvm-config`.

  ## 7.0.0 (2018-09-28)

  * Throw an `EncodeException` if a local variable is defined multiple
    times. This is consistent with `llc` which also forbids reusing
    variable names.
  * Update for LLVM 7.0:
    * The ORC JIT API has been changed to reflect the changes in LLVM
      itself. The test suite should give you a good idea of how to adapt
      your code but here is a summary:
      * There is now a separate `ExecutionSession` that tracks module handles.
      * `SymbolResolver` only has a single resolver function.
      * Creating an `ObjectLinkingLayer` requires a way to get the
        symbol resolver for a module.
      * Creating a `CompileOnDemandLayer` requires a way to set and get
        the symbol resolver for a module.

  ## 6.3.0 (2018-06-12)

  * `findSymbol` and `findSymbolIn` now return `Either JITSymbolError
    JITSymbol` if the JIT symbol has the error flag set or the address
    is 0. (This is consistent with how LLVM treats JIT symbols).
  * The return type of `SymbolResolverFn` has been changed to `Either
    JITSymbolError JITSymbol`. It is fine to return a 0 address in
    `Right` so existing resolvers can be adapted by wrapping the result
    in `Right`.
  * Fixed a bug where instructions were constant-folded during
    encoding. This caused problems since the API available on a Constant
    is not the same as the one on an Instruction (e.g., we cannot set
    metadata on a Constant).
  * Fix use-after-free in `createObjectFile`.
  * Add `withObjectFile` wrapper for `createObjectFile` and
    `disposeObjectFile`.
  * Add API for looking up symbols in the `LinkingLayer`.
  * Add `LLVM.OrcJIT.CompileLayer` and `LLVM.OrcJIT.LinkingLayer`
    modules that reexport the internal modules. The
    `findSymbol/findSymbolIn` methods that have previously been exported
    from `LLVM.OrcJIT` can now be found in `LLVM.OrcJIT.CompileLayer`.

  ## 6.2.0 (2018-05-08)

  * Remove field prefixes from `DIDerivedType`, `DIBasicType` and
    `DISubroutineType` to make the API consistent with the other debug
    metadata types.
  * Change the type of the scope fields in `DIModule` and `DINamespace`
    to `Maybe (MDRef DIScope)` to reflect that they can be optional.

  ## 6.1.1 (2018-05-06)

  * Fix the source distribution by adding missing files to extra-source-files.

  ## 6.1.0 (2018-05-05)

  * Remove the `MetadataNodeReference` constructor. References to
    metadata nodes are now encoded using the polymorphic `MDRef` type.
  * Add support for encoding and decoding debug metadata. Thanks to
    @xldenis who started that effort!
  * Drop support for GHC 7.10.
  * Support decoding/encoding of metadata in `GlobalVariable` and `Function`.
  * Fix check that the type of `GlobalReference` is correct in the
    presence of automatic renamings due to name collisions.
  * Extract LinkingLayer into a separate module.

  ## 6.0.0 (2018-03-06)

  * Support for LLVM 6.0, take a look at the changelog of llvm-hs-pure for details.
  * Add `AggregateZero` for zero-initializing structs, arrays and vectors. Previously `Null`
    was used for null pointers as  well as zero-inializing aggregates. The new behavior reflects
    LLVM’s internal representation and the C++-API.
  * Enforce that `Null` is only used on pointer types. Existing uses of `Null` on arrays, structs and
    vector must be changed to the newly introduced `AggregateZero`.

  ## 5.1.3 (2018-01-06)

  * Add bindings to `loadLibraryPermamently` and `getSymbolAddressInProcess`.

  ## 5.1.2 (2017-12-19)

  * Reupload of 5.1.1 since [Hackage broke](https://github.com/haskell/hackage-server/issues/643) during the original upload.

  ## 5.1.1 (2017-12-16)

  * Fix argument order in `LLVM_Hs_CreateTargetMachine`. This affects `withTargetMachine` and `withHostTargetMachine`.
  * Add support for `MCTargetOptions`.

  ## 5.1.0 (2017-10-12)

  ### Bugfixes

  * Set target options in `withTargetMachine`. Previously the options
    passed there were simply ignored.
  * Fix decoding of constant vectors.
  * Fix decoding of function attributes in calls.

  ### Enhancements

  * Support for more target options.
  * Suport string attributes as parameter attributes.
  * Support more calling conventions.
  * Support `NoTail` `TailCallKind`.

  ## 5.0.0 (2017-09-07)

  * Support for LLVM 5.0

      We only give a summary of the changes affecting the public API of `llvm-hs` here.
      Please refer to the official
      [release notes for LLVM 5.0](http://releases.llvm.org/5.0.0/docs/ReleaseNotes.html)
      for an overview of all changes in LLVM 5.0.

      * The `X86_64_Win64` calling convention is now called `Win64`.
      * There is a new `Speculatable` function attribute.
      * The `CrossThread` synchronization scope has been removed. There is
        now a new `System` synchronization scope.
      * The `OrcJIT`-API now operates on individual modules instead of
        sets of modules.
      * The `lessPreciseFloatingPointMultiplyAddOption` field has been
        removed from the target options.
      * The `compressDebugSections` option field is now of type
        `DebugCompressionType` instead of `Bool`.
      * The `BasicBlockVectorize` pass has been removed. You should use
        `SuperwordLevelParallelismVectorize` instead.

  * Throw 'EncodeException' when the type supplied in a
    'GlobalReference' does not match the type of the expression.
  * Throw 'EncodeException' when the result of instructions returning
    void is named using ':='.

  ## 4.2.0 (2017-06-20)

  * Revamp OrcJIT API
    * The user facing API is now exposed using `LLVM.OrcJIT`.
    * All user facing functions have been documented.
    * In addition the bracket-style API, there are now `new*` and
      `dispose*` functions making it easier to ingegrate OrcJIT in
      custom monad transformer stacks.
    * There is a new `CompileLayer` typeclass which abstracts over the
      various compile layers in `OrcJIT`.
  * Support QuickCheck 2.10

  ## 4.1.0 (2017-05-17)

  * Switch most of the API from `String` to `ByteString`.
  * Switch from ExceptT to using exceptions.
    See `LLVM.Exception` for an overview of the exceptions potentially thrown.

  ## 4.0.1

  * Fix linking of system libraries

  ## 4.0.0 (initial release, changes in comparison to llvm-general)

  * Move modules from `LLVM.General*` to `LLVM.*`
  * Support for LLVM 4.0
  * Improved support for LLVM’s exception handling instructions
  * `-fshared-llvm` is now supported on windows (thanks to @RyanGLScott)
  * Default to `-fshared-llvm`
  * Expose `LLVM.Internal.*` modules.

  llvm-hs is a set of Haskell bindings for LLVM <http://llvm.org/>. Unlike other current Haskell bindings,
  it uses an ADT to represent LLVM IR (<http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html>), and so offers two advantages: it
  handles almost all of the stateful complexities of using the LLVM API to build IR; and it supports moving IR not
  only from Haskell into LLVM C++ objects, but the other direction - from LLVM C++ into Haskell.
