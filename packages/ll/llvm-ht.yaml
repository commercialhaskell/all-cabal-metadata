  Haskell LLVM bindings
  ---------------------

  This package provides Haskell bindings for the popular LLVM compiler
  infrastructure project.  If you don't know what LLVM is, the main LLVM
  home page is here:

    http://llvm.org/


  Configuration
  -------------

  By default, when you run "runghc Setup configure", the Haskell
  bindings will be configured to install to /usr/local.  The configure
  script will look for your LLVM installation in that same directory.

  If you have LLVM installed in a different location, e.g. /usr, you can
  tell the configure script where to find it as follows:

    runghc Setup configure --configure-option=--with-llvm-prefix=/usr


  Package status - what to expect
  -------------------------------

  This package is still under development.

  The high level bindings are currently incomplete, so there are some
  limits on what you can do.  Adding new functions is generally easy,
  though, so don't be afraid to get your hands dirty.

  The high level interface is mostly safe, but the type system cannot
  protect against everything that can go wrong, so take care.  And, of
  course, there's no way to guarantee anything about the generated code.
