  # `llvm-pretty`

  A pretty printing library that was inspired by the LLVM binding by Lennart
  Augustsson. The library provides a monadic interface to a pretty printer, that
  allows functions to be defined and called, generating the corresponding LLVM
  assembly when run.

  ## LLVM language feature support

  Currently, `llvm-pretty` supports LLVM versions up through 17. As a result of
  the broad version coverage, the `llvm-pretty` AST is a superset of all versions
  of the LLVM AST. This means that the manner in which certain information is
  presented in the `llvm-pretty` AST (e.g., during pretty printing) will be
  different depending on the LLVM version used to originate the information.
  Conversely, it is possible to construct an `llvm-pretty` AST that cannot be
  represented in a specific (or any) LLVM version.

  `llvm-pretty` strives to support a reasonable variety of [LLVM language
  features](https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html), but there are places where our
  coverage of the LLVM language is incomplete. If you need a LLVM feature that is
  not currently supported by `llvm-pretty`, please [file an
  issue](https://github.com/GaloisInc/llvm-pretty/issues/new).

  ## `llvm-pretty` versus `llvm-pretty-bc-parser`

  `llvm-pretty` supports almost everything that one would want to do with LLVM
  ASTs. One notable exception is parsing: `llvm-pretty` deliberately does not
  support parsing an LLVM module AST from a bitcode file. This functionality is
  factored out into a separate
  [`llvm-pretty-bc-parser`](https://github.com/GaloisInc/llvm-pretty-bc-parser)
  library. `llvm-pretty-bc-parser` generally tries to stay in sync with all of
  the LLVM language features that `llvm-pretty` supports, but it may be the case
  that some valid `llvm-pretty` ASTs cannot be parsed by `llvm-pretty-bc-parser`.
  If you encounter an occurrence of this issue, please [file an
  issue](https://github.com/GaloisInc/llvm-pretty-bc-parser/issues/new) at the
  `llvm-pretty-bc-parser` issue tracker.
