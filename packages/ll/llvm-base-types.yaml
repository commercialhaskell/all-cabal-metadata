description: |
  This package defines types used in the llvm-analysis and
  llvm-data-interop packages.

  This is a separate package mostly because llvm-data-interop needed to
  be split out due to C++ linkage issues.  llvm-data-interop needs the
  definitions in this packages but cannot depend on llvm-analysis (which
  also needs these types).

  Further, to avoid code duplication some of the C++ enumeration values
  used in llvm-data-interop are actually included with this package.
  The definitions in this package are used (via c2hs) to build Haskell
  equivalents.  The base types need these definitions, but the
  llvm-data-interop package also needs to be able to find the header.
  This is handled in Setup.hs in llvm-data-interop with cooperation from
  this package (which exports the cabal-generated path to the installed
  header).

  Only llvm-data-interop and llvm-analysis should ever need to reference
  this package since llvm-analysis re-exports all of the definitions.
