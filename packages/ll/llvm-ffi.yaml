  FFI bindings to the LLVM compiler toolkit.

  Installation cannot be done fully automatically.
  It would require Cabal code that is bound to certain Cabal versions
  and is prone to fail.
  We give several non-automatic ways
  that also allow you to choose a particular LLVM version.

  First possibility is to point Cabal
  to the LLVM installation directories manually.
  On Ubuntu this would look like this:

  > cabal install --extra-include-dirs=/usr/lib/llvm-9/include --extra-lib-dirs=/usr/lib/llvm-9/lib llvm-ffi

  For @cabal new-build@ this does not work,
  because every package build is bound to all influencing flags.
  That is, if you build, say @llvm-tf@,
  it depends on @llvm-ffi@ without the extra-lib-dirs flag.
  In order to solve this problem,
  you may specify the extra directories in the global Cabal configuration.
  I.e. you may add the following lines to @.cabal/config@:

  > extra-include-dirs: /usr/lib/llvm-9/include
  > extra-lib-dirs: /usr/lib/llvm-9/lib

  You can store such paths permanently in a @pkg-config@ file like @llvm.pc@.
  The optimal way would be if LLVM installations or GNU/Linux distributions
  would contain such a file, but they don't.
  Instead, you may generate it using the @llvm-pkg-config@ package
  or write one manually.
  Then you run

  > cabal install -fpkgConfig

  We try to stay up to date with LLVM releases.
  The current version of this package is compatible with LLVM 3.9-9.
  Please understand that the package may or may not work
  against older LLVM releases.

  Warning for inplace builds:
  Re-configuring the package using, say -fllvm600,
  and re-buildung it might result in corrupt code.
  You must make sure that the stuff in @cbits@ is re-compiled.
  Cabal or GHC may forget about that.
  You are safe if you run @cabal clean@.
