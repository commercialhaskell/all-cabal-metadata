description: |
  This package converts the LLVM IR (either bitcode files or LLVM
  assembly) into a Haskell data type (defined in llvm-base-types).  The
  conversion uses the LLVM libraries to read bitcode.  It then traverses
  the IR and produces a Haskell structure that can be pattern matched
  against in pure code.

  After the conversion, no C++ data is referenced and no C++ code is
  called.  This library does link against LLVM directly, and therefore
  also uses libstdc++.  This can make linking tricky sometimes.  For
  example, mixing template-haskell with C++-linked code does not seem to
  work.

  Note that this library only works with LLVM 3.0-3.3, and will try to
  retain as much compatibility with future and past versions as is
  reasonable.

  # Installation Notes

   * Currently, this library is set up to link against the LLVM shared
     library (libLLVM-3.X.so).  Most distro packages build the LLVM
     shared library.  If you make a custom build, be sure to configure
     with `--enable-shared`.

  ## Debian and Ubuntu

  You need the development libraries and headers, so be sure to install
  the llvm-3.X-dev package, where X is the version you would like to
  use.  You will also need clang.

  # Changes

  ## v0.3.0

   * Support LLVM-3.3 (contributed by Patrick Hulin)
   * Minor breaking change in MetaDW*Type.  These no longer have a
     MetaDWFile; instead, they directly contain their file and directory
     information.
