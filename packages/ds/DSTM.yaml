  The Cabal library package
  =========================

  Installation instructions for the DSTM library
  ===============================================

  Installing as a user (no root or administer access)
  ---------------------------------------------------

      ghc --make Setup
      ./Setup configure --user
      ./Setup build
      ./Setup install

  Note the use of the `--user` flag at the configure step.

  Compiling Setup rather than using `runghc Setup` is much faster and works on
  Windows. For all packages other than Cabal itself it is fine to use `runghc`.

  This will install into `$HOME/.cabal/` on unix and into
  `$Documents and Settings\$User\Application Data\cabal\` on Windows
  If you want to install elsewhere use the `--prefix=` flag at the
  configure step.


  Installing as root / Administrator
  ----------------------------------

      ghc --make Setup
      ./Setup configure
      ./Setup build
      sudo ./Setup install

  Compiling Setup rather than using `runghc Setup` is much faster and works on
  Windows. For all packages other than Cabal itself it is fine to use `runghc`.

  This will install into `/usr/local` on unix and on Windows it will
  install into `$ProgramFiles/Haskell`. If you want to install
  elsewhere use the `--prefix=` flag at the configure step.
