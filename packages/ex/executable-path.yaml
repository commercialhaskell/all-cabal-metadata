  The documentation of "System.Environment.getProgName" says that
  \"However, this is hard-to-impossible to implement on some non-Unix OSes,
  so instead, for maximum portability, we just return the leafname
  of the program as invoked.\"
  This library tries to provide the missing path.
  Note: Since base 4.6.0.0, there is also a function
  "System.Environment.getExecutablePath".
