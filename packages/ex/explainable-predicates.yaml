description: |-
  Explainable predicates are essentially functions from types
  to 'Bool' which can additionally describe themselves and
  explain why an argument does or doesn't match.  They are
  intended to be used during unit tests to provide better
  error messages when tests fail.  For example, if a
  collection is missing an element, an explainable predicate
  can tell you which element is missing.
