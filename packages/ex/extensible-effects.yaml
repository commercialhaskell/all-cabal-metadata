  effectful computations in a modular way!*\n\nThe main monad of this package is `Eff`
  from `Control.Eff`.\n`Eff r a` is parameterized by the effect-list `r` and the monadic-result
  type\n`a` similar to other monads.\nIt is the intention that all other monadic computations
  can be replaced by the\nuse of `Eff`.\n\nIn case you know monad transformers or
  `mtl`:\nThis library provides only one monad that includes all your effects instead
  of\nlayering different transformers.\nIt is not necessary to lift the computations
  through a monad stack.\nAlso, it is not required to lift every `Monad*` typeclass
  (like `MonadError`)\nthough all transformers.\n\n## Quickstart\n\nTo experiment
  with this library, it is suggested to write some lines within\n`ghci`.\n\nRecommended
  Procedure:\n\n1. get `extensible-effects` by doing one of the following:\n  * add
  `extensible-effects` as a dependency to a existing cabal or stack project\n  * `git
  clone https://github.com/suhailshergill/extensible-effects.git`\n2. start `stack
  ghci` or `cabal repl` inside the project\n3. import `Control.Eff` and `Control.Eff.QuickStart`\n4.
  start with the examples provided in the documentation of the `Control.Eff.QuickStart`
  module\n\n## Tour through Extensible Effects\n\nThis section explains the basic
  concepts of this library.\n\n### The Effect List\n\n```haskell\nimport Control.Eff\n```\n\nThe
  effect list `r` in the type `Eff r a` is a central concept in this library.\nIt
  is a type-level list containing effect types.\n\nIf `r` is the empty list, then
  the computation `Eff r` (or `Eff '[]`) does not\ncontain any effects to be handled
  and therefore is a pure computation.\nIn this case, the result value can be retrieved
  by `run :: Eff '[] a -> a`\n\nFor programming within the `Eff r` monad, it is almost
  never necessary to list\nall effects that can appear.\nIt suffices to state what
  types of effects are at least required.\nThis is done via the `Member t r` typeclass.
  It describes that the type `t`\noccurs inside the list `r`.\nIf you really want,
  you can still list all Effects and their order in which\nthey are used (e.g. `Eff
  '[Reader r, State s] a`).\n\n### Handling Effects\n\nFunctions containing something
  like `Eff (x ': r) a -> Eff r a` handle effects.\n\nThe transition from the longer
  list of effects `(x ': r)` to just `r`\nis a type-level indicator that the effect
  `x` has been handled.\nDepending on the effect, some additional input might be required
  or some\ndifferent output than just `a` is produced.\n\nThe handler functions typically
  are called `run*`, `eval*` or `exec*`.\n\n### Most common Effects\n\nThe most common
  effects used are `Writer`, `Reader`, `Exception` and `State`.\n\nFor the `Writer`,
  `Reader` and `State`, there are lazy and a strict variants.\nEach has its own module
  that provide the same interface.\nBy importing one or the other, it can be controlled
  if the effect is strict or\nlazy in its inputs and outputs.\nUnless required otherwise,
  it is suggested to use the lazy variants.\n\nIn this section, only the core functions
  associated with an effect are\npresented.\nHave a look at the modules for additional
  details.\n\n#### The Exception Effect\n\n```haskell\nimport Control.Eff.Exception\n```\n\nThe
  exception effect adds the possibility to exit a computation preemptively\nwith an
  exception.\nNote that the exceptions from this library are handled by the programmer
  and\nhave nothing to do with exceptions thrown inside the Haskell run-time.\n\n```haskell\nthrowError
  :: Member (Exc e) r => e -> Eff r a\nrunError :: Eff (Exc e ': r) a -> Eff r (Either
  e a)\n```\n\nAn exception can be thrown using the `throwError` function.\nIts return
  type is `Eff r a` with an arbitrary type `a`.\nWhen handling the effect, the result-type
  changes to `Either e a` instead of\njust `a`.\nThis indicates how the effect is
  handled: The returned value is either the\nthrown exception or the value returned
  from a successful computation.\n\n#### The State Effect\n\n```haskell\nimport Control.Eff.State.{Lazy
  | Strict}\n```\n\nThe state effect provides readable and writable state during a
  computation.\n\n```haskell\nget :: Member (State s) r => Eff r s\nput :: Member
  (State s) r => s -> Eff r ()\nmodify :: Member (State s) r => (s -> s) -> Eff r
  ()\nrunState :: s -> Eff (State s ': r) a -> Eff r (a, s)\n```\n\nThe `get` functions
  accesses the current state and makes it usable within the\nfurther computation.\nThe
  `put` function sets the state to the given value.\n`modify` updates the state using
  a mapping function by combining `get` and\n`put`.\n\nThe state-effect is handled
  using the `runState` function.\nIt takes the initial state as an argument and returns
  the final state and\neffect-result.\n\n#### The Reader Effect\n\n```haskell\nimport
  Control.Eff.Reader.{Strict | Lazy}\n```\n\nThe reader effect provides an environment
  that can be read.\nSometimes it is considered as read-only state.\n\n```haskell\nask
  :: Member (Reader e) r => e -> Eff r e\nrunReader :: e -> Eff (Reader e ': r) a
  -> Eff r a\n```\n\nThe environment given to the handle the reader effect is the
  one given during\nthe computation if asked for.\n\n#### The Writer Effect\n\n```haskell\nimport
  Control.Eff.Writer.{Strict | Lazy}\n```\n\nThe writer effect allows to output messages
  during a computation.\nIt is sometimes referred to as write-only state, which gets
  retrieved at the\nend of the computation.\n\n```haskell\ntell :: Member (Writer
  w) r => w -> Eff r ()\nrunWriter :: (w -> b -> b) -> b -> Eff (Writer w ': r) a
  -> Eff r (a, b)\nrunListWriter :: Eff (Writer w ': r) a -> Eff r (a, [w])\n```\n\nRunning
  a writer can be done in several ways.\nThe most general function is `runWriter`
  that folds over all written values.\nHowever, if you only want to collect the the
  values written, the `runListWriter`\nfunction does that.\n\nNote that compared to
  mtl, the value written has no Monoid constraint on it and\ncan be collected in any
  way.\n\n### Using multiple Effects\n\nThe main benefit of this library is that multiple
  effects can be included\nwith ease.\n\nIf you need state and want to be able exit
  the computation with an exception,\nthe type of your effectful computation would
  be the one of `myComp` below.\nThen, both the state and exception effect-functions
  can be used.\nTo handle the effects, both the `runState` and `runError` functions
  have to be\nprovided.\n\n```haskell\nmyComp :: (Member (Exc e) r, Member (State
  s) r) => Eff r a\n\nrun1 :: (Either e a, s)\nrun1 = run . runState initalState .
  runError $ myComp\n\nrun2 :: Either e (a, s)\nrun2 = run . runError . runState initalState
  $ myComp\n```\n\nHowever, the order of the handlers does matter for the final result.\n`run1`
  and `run2` show different executions of the same effectful computation.\nIn `run1`,
  the returned state `s` is the last state seen before an eventual\nexception gets
  thrown (similar to the semantics in typical imperative\nlanguages), while in `run2`
  the final state is returned only if the whole\ncomputation succeeded - transaction
  style.\n\n### Tips and tricks\n\nThere are several constructs that make it easier
  to work with the effects.\n\nIf only a part of the result is necessary for the further
  computation, have a\nlook at the `eval*` and `exec*` functions, which exist for
  some effects.\nThe `exec*` functions discard the result of the computation (the
  `a` type).\nThe `eval*` functions discard the final result of the effect.\n\nInstead
  of writing\n`(Member (Exc e) r, Member (State s) r) => ...` it is\npossible to use
  the type operator `<::` and write\n`[ Exc e, State s ] <:: r => ...`, which has
  the same meaning.\n\nIt might be convenient to include the necessary language extensions
  and the\ndisabling of the class-constriant warnings in the cabal-file of your project.\n*Explanation
  is work in progress*\n\n## Other Effects\n\n*work in progress*\n\n## Integration
  with IO\n\n`IO` as well as any other monad can be used as a base type for `Lift`
  effect.\nThere may be at most one instance of `Lift` effect in the effects list,
  and it\nmust be handled the last. `Control.Eff.Lift` exports `runLift` handler and\n`lift`
  function, that provides an ability to run arbitrary monadic actions.\nAlso, there
  are convenient type aliases, that allow for shorter type constraints.\n\n```haskell\nf
  :: IO ()\nf = runLift $ do printHello\n                 printWorld\n\n-- These two
  functions' types are equivalent.\n\nprintHello :: SetMember Lift (Lift IO) r =>
  Eff r ()\nprintHello = lift (putStr \"Hello\")\n\nprintWorld :: Lifted IO r => Eff
  r ()\nprintWorld = lift (putStrLn \" world!\")\n```\n\nNote that, since `Lift` is
  a terminal effect, you do not need to use `run` to\nextract pure value. Instead,
  `runLift` returns a value wrapped in whatever monad\nyou chose to use.\n\nIn addition,
  `Lift` effect provides `MonadBase`, `MonadBaseControl`, and `MonadIO`\ninstances,
  that may be useful, especially with packages like [lifted-base](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lifted-base),\n[lifted-async](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lifted-async),
  and other\ncode that uses those typeclasses.\n\n## Integration with Monad Transformers\n\n*work

  Other packages\n\nSome other packages may implement various effects. Here is a rather
  incomplete\nlist:\n\n* [log-effect](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/log-effect)\n\n##
  Background\n\nextensible-effects is based on the work\n[Extensible Effects: An Alternative
  to Monad Transformers](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/).\nThe [paper](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/exteff.pdf)
  and\nthe followup [freer paper](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/more.pdf)\ncontain
  details. Additional explanation behind the approach can be found on [Oleg's website](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/).\n\n##
  Limitations\n\n### Ambiguity-Flexibility tradeoff\nThe extensibility of `Eff` comes
  at the cost of some ambiguity. A useful pattern\nto mitigate the ambiguity is to
  specialize the call to the handler of effects\nusing [type application](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/TypeApplication)\nor
  type annotation. Examples of this pattern can be seen in\n[Example/Test.hs](./test/Control/Eff/Example/Test.hs).\n\nNote,
  however, that the extensibility can also be traded back, but that detracts\nfrom
  some of the advantages. For details see section 4.1 in the\n[paper](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/exteff.pdf).\n\nSome
  examples where the cost of extensibility is apparent:\n\n  * Common functions can't
  be grouped using typeclasses, e.g.\n    the `ask` and `getState` functions can't
  be grouped with some\n\n    ```haskell\n    class Get t a where\n      ask :: Member
  (t a) r => Eff r a\n    ```\n\n    `ask` is inherently ambiguous, since the type
  signature only provides\n    a constraint on `t`, and nothing more. To specify fully,
  a parameter\n    involving the type `t` would need to be added, which would defeat
  the\n    point of having the grouping in the first place.\n  * Code requires greater
  number of type annotations. For details see\n    [#31](https://github.com/suhailshergill/extensible-effects/issues/31).\n\n###
  Current implementation only supports GHC version 7.8 and above\nThis is not a fundamental
  limitation of the design or the approach, but there is\nan overhead with making
  the code compatible across a large number of GHC\nversions. If this is needed, patches
  are welcome :)\n"
