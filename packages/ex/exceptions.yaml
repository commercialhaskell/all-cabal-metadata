synopsis: Extensible optionally-pure exceptions
changelog: ! "0.10.0\n------\n* Fix a regression in 0.9.0 whereby the non-IO effects
  in `bracket`'s `use`\n  action were not visible to the `release` action, and the
  non-IO effects in the\n  `release` action were not visible after the `bracket` call.\n*
  The type of `generalBracket` was changed in order to restore those non-IO\n  effects,
  so if you are a library author that provides a `MonadMask` instance,\n  you will
  need to update your implementation of this method.\n* Add `MonadMask` instance for
  `MaybeT`\n* Add `onError` function whose action also runs on errors which are not\n
  \ exceptions, such as a `Nothing` or a `Left`.\n\n0.9.0\n-----\n* Add `generalBracket`
  to the `MonadMask` typeclass, allowing more\n  valid instances.\n\n  Note that functions
  such as `bracket` and `finally` are now based off of\n  `generalBracket`, so if
  you are a library author that provides a `MonadMask`\n  instance, you will need
  to provide an implementation of this method.\n* Add `MonadMask` instances for `ExceptT`
  and `ErrorT`\n\n0.8.3\n-----\n* `MonadCatch` and `MonadMask` instances for `Either
  SomeException`\n\n0.8.1\n-----\n* Support for throwing in the `template-haskell`
  `Q` monad\n* Support for `transformers` 0.5\n\n0.8.0.1\n-------\n* Resolved warnings
  on GHC 7.10 and with transformers 0.4.\n\n0.8\n---\n* Use `transformers-compat`
  to allow support for `ExceptT` even on older `transformers` versions.\n\n0.7\n---\n*
  `stm` support\n\n0.6\n---\n* Split out `MonadMask`\n* Added `transformers` 0.4 support\n\n0.5\n---\n*
  Added instances of `MonadThrow` for `ListT`, `MaybeT`, `ErrorT` and `ContT`.\n\n0.4\n---\n*
  Factored out a separate `MonadThrow`.\n\n0.3.3.1\n-------\n* QuickCheck dependency
  bump\n\n0.3.3\n-----\n* Relicensed under the 3-clause BSD license.\n\n0.3.2\n-----\n*
  Better documentation for `CatchT`.\n* Added `handle`-like analogues for parity with
  `Control.Exception`.\n\n0.3.1\n-----\n* Fixed test suite.\n\n0.3\n---\n* Moved `CatchT`
  to `Control.Monad.Catch.Pure` to make it clear it isn't required for working with
  `IO`.\n\n0.2.1\n---\n* Added `mask_` and `uninterruptibleMask_` to `Control.Monad.Catch`.\n\n0.2\n---\n*
  Added `uninterruptibleMask` to `MonadCatch`.\n\n0.1.1\n-----\n* Flagged `Control.Monad.Catch`
  as `Trustworthy`\n\n0.1.0.1\n-----\n* License fix. We were accidentally listing
  both an APL and BSD3 license in the same module\n\n0.1\n---\n* Repository initialized\n"

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/exceptions.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/exceptions)
  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ekmett/exceptions.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ekmett/exceptions)


  This package provides (optionally pure) extensible exceptions that are compatible
  with the monad transformer library.
