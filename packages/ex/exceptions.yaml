changelog: |
  0.10.4 [2019.12.26]
  -------------------
  * Allow building with `template-haskell-2.16.*`.
  * Only depend on `transformers-compat` on old versions of GHC.

  0.10.3 [2019.08.27]
  -------------------
  * `MonadThrow` instance for the strict `ST` monad.

  0.10.2 [2019.05.02]
  -------------------
  * Allow building with `base-4.13`/`template-haskell-2.15`.

  0.10.1 [2019.03.26]
  -------------------
  * Define a `MonadFail` instance for `CatchT`.
  * Allow `QuickCheck-2.13` in the test suite.

  0.10.0
  ------
  * Fix a regression in 0.9.0 whereby the non-IO effects in `bracket`'s `use`
    action were not visible to the `release` action, and the non-IO effects in the
    `release` action were not visible after the `bracket` call.
  * The type of `generalBracket` was changed in order to restore those non-IO
    effects, so if you are a library author that provides a `MonadMask` instance,
    you will need to update your implementation of this method.
  * Add `MonadMask` instance for `MaybeT`
  * Add `onError` function whose action also runs on errors which are not
    exceptions, such as a `Nothing` or a `Left`.

  0.9.0
  -----
  * Add `generalBracket` to the `MonadMask` typeclass, allowing more
    valid instances.

    Note that functions such as `bracket` and `finally` are now based off of
    `generalBracket`, so if you are a library author that provides a `MonadMask`
    instance, you will need to provide an implementation of this method.
  * Add `MonadMask` instances for `ExceptT` and `ErrorT`

  0.8.3
  -----
  * `MonadCatch` and `MonadMask` instances for `Either SomeException`

  0.8.1
  -----
  * Support for throwing in the `template-haskell` `Q` monad
  * Support for `transformers` 0.5

  0.8.0.1
  -------
  * Resolved warnings on GHC 7.10 and with transformers 0.4.

  0.8
  ---
  * Use `transformers-compat` to allow support for `ExceptT` even on older `transformers` versions.

  0.7
  ---
  * `stm` support

  0.6
  ---
  * Split out `MonadMask`
  * Added `transformers` 0.4 support

  0.5
  ---
  * Added instances of `MonadThrow` for `ListT`, `MaybeT`, `ErrorT` and `ContT`.

  0.4
  ---
  * Factored out a separate `MonadThrow`.

  0.3.3.1
  -------
  * QuickCheck dependency bump

  0.3.3
  -----
  * Relicensed under the 3-clause BSD license.

  0.3.2
  -----
  * Better documentation for `CatchT`.
  * Added `handle`-like analogues for parity with `Control.Exception`.

  0.3.1
  -----
  * Fixed test suite.

  0.3
  ---
  * Moved `CatchT` to `Control.Monad.Catch.Pure` to make it clear it isn't required for working with `IO`.

  0.2.1
  ---
  * Added `mask_` and `uninterruptibleMask_` to `Control.Monad.Catch`.

  0.2
  ---
  * Added `uninterruptibleMask` to `MonadCatch`.

  0.1.1
  -----
  * Flagged `Control.Monad.Catch` as `Trustworthy`

  0.1.0.1
  -----
  * License fix. We were accidentally listing both an APL and BSD3 license in the same module

  0.1
  ---
  * Repository initialized

  exceptions
  ==========

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/exceptions.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/exceptions) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ekmett/exceptions.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ekmett/exceptions)

  This package provides (optionally pure) extensible exceptions that are compatible with the monad transformer library.
