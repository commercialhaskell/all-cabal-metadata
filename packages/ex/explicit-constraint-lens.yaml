description: |-
  A snowclone of the great <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens>
  library. It implements the full hierarchy from isomorphisms to
  setters and folds, but instead of the Van Laarhoven implementation with
  universally-quantified functor mappings (powerful and elegant, but
  infamously beginner-scaring), it encapsulates the various
  realworld-usecase signatures like get+set or build+distinguish
  in a well-confined type family and expresses the relations between the
  different optics explicitly, with a dedicated class hierarchy.

  See <https://github.com/leftaroundabout/explicit-constraint-lens/blob/master/README.md the Readme>
  for details on how this library differs from the alternatives. See
  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/explicit-constraint-lens/docs/Lens-Explicit.html the Haddocks>
  to learn how to use it.
