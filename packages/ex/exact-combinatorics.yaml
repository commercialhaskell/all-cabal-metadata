changelog: |
  0.2.0.11 (2021-11-02):
      - Added `Tested-With: GHC == 9.2.1` (didn't actually need to
        nudge the upper bound on 'base', because it's already lenient)
  0.2.0.10 (2021-10-16):
      - Changed from TravisCI to GithubActions
  0.2.0.9 (2019-04-13):
      - Changed cabal to use Simple build type, to support cabal's new-build.
      - Removed the CPP hack for Haddock documentation, as part
        of switching to the Simple build type.
      - Using BangPatterns in lieu of the old seq-undefined-guard trick.
      - Added TravisCI integration
  0.2.0.8 (2015-05-30):
      - Moved VERSION to CHANGELOG
  0.2.0.4 (2012-09-26):
      - Math.Combinatorics.Exact.Binomial: added OEIS link
  0.2.0 (2012-02-02):
      - renamed to exact-combinatorics.
      - moved Math.Combinatorics.* to Math.Combinatorics.Exact.*

  0.1.0 (2011-12-04):
      - init.

description: "exact-combinatorics\n===================\n[![Hackage version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/exact-combinatorics.svg?style=flat)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/exact-combinatorics)
  \n[![Build Status](https://github.com/wrengr/exact-combinatorics/workflows/ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wrengr/exact-combinatorics/actions?query=workflow%3Aci)\n[![Dependencies](https://img.shields.io/hackage-deps/v/exact-combinatorics.svg?style=flat)](http://packdeps.haskellers.com/specific?package=exact-combinatorics)\n\nEfficient
  exact computation of combinatoric functions.\n\n\n## Install\n\nThis is a simple
  package and should be easy to install via the\nstandared method:\n\n    $> cabal
  install exact-combinatorics\n\n\n## Portability\n\nAn attempt has been made to keep
  this library as portable as possible.\nIt is entirely Haskell98 with the exception
  of one use of BangPatterns.\nBangPatterns are supported in GHC as far back as [version\n6.6.1][ghc-bangpatterns],
  and are also supported by [JHC][jhc-bangpatterns]\nand [UHC][uhc-bangpatterns].
  As of 2010, they were [not supported\nby Hugs][hugs-bangpatterns]; but alas Hugs
  is pretty much dead now.\n\n[ghc-bangpatterns]: \n    https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/6.6.1/docs/html/users_guide/sec-bang-patterns.html\n[jhc-bangpatterns]:\n
