  # ex-pool

  A fork of [resource-pool](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/resource-pool)
  providing a high-performance striped resource pooling implementation for
  Haskell.

  The package is intended to be a drop-in replacement for the original
  version, for when the following properties seem useful:

    * Unlike the original implementation, this library enables actions to be run
      in `MonadIO` (instead of plain `IO`), and uses
      [exceptions](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/exceptions) for exception
      handling.

    * Also, a number of yet-to-be-released enhancements and fixes to the original
      library are included (namely [#11](https://github.com/bos/pool/pull/11),
      [#15](https://github.com/bos/pool/pull/15),
      [#16](https://github.com/bos/pool/pull/16)).

  That is, if you don't need any of the above, use the original package :)
