synopsis: Dependent pairs and their instances.
changelog: ! "# Version 0.6\n\n* The `binary` and `deepseq` Cabal flags were removed
  since these two packages\n  are always included with the GHC distribution, so it
  doesn't make sense to\n  make them optional.\n\n* The optional dependencies hidden
  behind Cabal flags now apply to the test\n  suite as well.\n\n* Builds with GHC
  8.4.\n\n\n# Version 0.5\n\n* BREAKING: Depend on `singletons == 2.3.*`.\n\n* Add
  `same{1,2,3,4}`.\n\n* Add dependencies on `cborg` and `serialise`\n\n* Add instances
  for `serialise` (binary CBOR encoding/decoding)\n\n\n# Version 0.4\n\n* BREAKING:
  Decouple `binary` and `cereal` instances from `bytes`. This\n  introduces a slight
  backwards incompatible change if you were using some\n  `Serial` instances that
  depended on host endianness (such as `Int`).\n\n* Add `P1`, `P2`, `P3`, `P4`.\n\n*
  Add `S1`, `S2`, `S3`, `S4`.\n\n* Add `Read` instances for `Some{1,2,3,4}`.\n\n*
  Moved documentation from `README.md` into the top-level `Exinst` module.\n\n\n#
  Version 0.3.0.1\n\n* Removed dependency on `generic-random`.\n\n* Correctly deal
  with cabal flags for `deepseq` and `hashable`.\n\n* Add `binary`'s `Data.Binary.Binary`
  and `cereal`'s `Data.Serialize.Serialize`\n  instances for `Some{1,2,3,4}`. These
  instances are compatible with each other\n  and rely on the `Data.Bytes.Serial`
  instances.\n\n\n# Version 0.3\n\n* BREAKING: Renamed module `Exinst.Singletons`
  to  `Exinst`.\n\n* BREAKING: The `Exinst.Instances.Base` module is gone. The `base`
  instances are\n  now exported from `Exinst`.\n\n* Add `Dict0`.\n\n* Re-export `Constraint`
  from `base`.\n\n* Add `Dict{0,2,3,4}` instances for `Bool`.\n\n* Add `GHC.Generics.Generic`
  support for `Some{1,2,3,4}`. This only works for\n  indexes with `PEnum` and `PBounded`
  instances.\n\n* Added tests.\n\n* Added `Test.QuickCheck.Arbitrary` instances for
  `Some{1,2,3,4}` in\n  `Exinst.Instances.QuickCheck`. These instances and their dependency
  on\n  `QuickCheck` can be toggled with the `quickcheck` Cabal flag.\n\n* Added `Data.Aeson.{FromJSON,ToJSON}`
  instances for `Some{1,2,3,4}` in\n  `Exinst.Instances.Aeson`. These instances and
  their dependency on\n  `aeson` can be toggled with the `aeson` Cabal flag. These
  instances used to\n  exist in now-deprecated the `exinst-aeson` package, and are
  compatible with\n  them.\n\n* Added `Bytes.Serial.Serial` instances for `Some{1,2,3,4}`
  in\n  `Exinst.Instances.Bytes`. These instances and their dependency on `bytes`
  can\n  be toggled with the `bytes` Cabal flag. These instances used to exist in\n
  \ now-deprecated the `exinst-bytes` package, and are compatible with them.\n\n*
  Added `Control.DeepSeq.NFData` instances for `Some{1,2,3,4}` in\n  `Exinst.Instances.DeepSeq`.
  These instances and their dependency on `deepseq`\n  can be toggled with the `deepseq`
  Cabal flag. These instances used to exist in\n  now-deprecated the `exinst-deepseq`
  package, and are compatible with them.\n\n* Added `Data.Hashable.Hashable` instances
  for `Some{1,2,3,4}` in\n  `Exinst.Instances.DeepSeq`. These instances and their
  dependency on `hashable`\n  can be toggled with the `hashable` Cabal flag. These
  instances used to exist\n  in now-deprecated the `exinst-hashable` package, and
  are compatible with them.\n\n\n# Version 0.2\n\n* Depend on `singletons-2.2`, which
  means `KProxy` is gone.\n\n* Add `_Some{1,2,3,4}` prisms.\n\n* Add `Dict1` instance
  for `Bool`.\n\n* Add `some{1,2,3,4}SingRep`.\n\n* Thanks to Sandy Maguire for having
  contributed to this release.\n\n\n# Version 0.1.2\n\n* Export the `Some{1,2,3,4}`
  constructors.\n\n* Make all the fields in `Some{1,2,3,4}` strict.\n\n* Relax upper
  bound on `base`, `singletons`, `constraints`.\n\n* Re-export `Dict(Dict)` from `constraints`.\n\n\n#
  Version 0.1.1\n\n* Relax upper bound on `singletons` dependency.\n\n* `withSome{1,2,3,4}Sing`
  brings `SingI` instances to scope.\n\n* Generalized the `(* -> Constraint)` parameter
  in `Dict{1,2,3,4}`\n  to `(k -> Constraint)`.\n\n\n# Version 0.1\n\n* Initial release.\n"
