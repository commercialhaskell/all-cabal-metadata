changelog: ! "# Version 0.3\n\n* BREAKING: Renamed module `Exinst.Singletons` to  `Exinst`.\n\n*
  BREAKING: The `Exinst.Instances.Base` module is gone. The `base` instances are\n
  \ now exported from `Exinst`.\n\n* Add `Dict0`.\n\n* Re-export `Constraint` from
  `base`.\n\n* Add `Dict{0,2,3,4}` instances for `Bool`.\n\n* Add `GHC.Generics.Generic`
  support for `Some{1,2,3,4}`. This only works for\n  indexes with `PEnum` and `PBounded`
  instances.\n\n* Added tests.\n\n* Added `Test.QuickCheck.Arbitrary` instances for
  `Some{1,2,3,4}` in\n  `Exinst.Instances.QuickCheck`. These instances and their dependency
  on\n  `QuickCheck` can be toggled with the `quickcheck` Cabal flag.\n\n* Added `Data.Aeson.{FromJSON,ToJSON}`
  instances for `Some{1,2,3,4}` in\n  `Exinst.Instances.Aeson`. These instances and
  their dependency on\n  `aeson` can be toggled with the `aeson` Cabal flag. These
  instances used to\n  exist in now-deprecated the `exinst-aeson` package, and are
  compatible with\n  them.\n\n* Added `Bytes.Serial.Serial` instances for `Some{1,2,3,4}`
  in\n  `Exinst.Instances.Bytes`. These instances and their dependency on `bytes`
  can\n  be toggled with the `bytes` Cabal flag. These instances used to exist in\n
  \ now-deprecated the `exinst-bytes` package, and are compatible with them.\n\n*
  Added `Control.DeepSeq.NFData` instances for `Some{1,2,3,4}` in\n  `Exinst.Instances.DeepSeq`.
  These instances and their dependency on `deepseq`\n  can be toggled with the `deepseq`
  Cabal flag. These instances used to exist in\n  now-deprecated the `exinst-deepseq`
  package, and are compatible with them.\n\n* Added `Data.Hashable.Hashable` instances
  for `Some{1,2,3,4}` in\n  `Exinst.Instances.DeepSeq`. These instances and their
  dependency on `hashable`\n  can be toggled with the `hashable` Cabal flag. These
  instances used to exist\n  in now-deprecated the `exinst-hashable` package, and
  are compatible with them.\n\n\n# Version 0.2\n\n* Depend on `singletons-2.2`, which
  means `KProxy` is gone.\n\n* Add `_Some{1,2,3,4}` prisms.\n\n* Add `Dict1` instance
  for `Bool`.\n\n* Add `some{1,2,3,4}SingRep`.\n\n* Thanks to Sandy Maguire for having
  contributed to this release.\n\n\n# Version 0.1.2\n\n* Export the `Some{1,2,3,4}`
  constructors.\n\n* Make all the fields in `Some{1,2,3,4}` strict.\n\n* Relax upper
  bound on `base`, `singletons`, `constraints`.\n\n* Re-export `Dict(Dict)` from `constraints`.\n\n\n#
  Version 0.1.1\n\n* Relax upper bound on `singletons` dependency.\n\n* `withSome{1,2,3,4}Sing`
  brings `SingI` instances to scope.\n\n* Generalized the `(* -> Constraint)` parameter
  in `Dict{1,2,3,4}`\n  to `(k -> Constraint)`.\n\n\n# Version 0.1\n\n* Initial release.\n"

description: ! "# exinst\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/k0001/exinst.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/k0001/exinst)\n\n>
  See the [BSD3 LICENSE](https://github.com/k0001/exinst/blob/master/exinst/LICENSE.txt)\n>
  file to learn about the legal terms and conditions for this library.\n\nExinst is
  a library providing you with tools to automatically derive instances for\ntype-indexed
  types whose type-indexes have been existentialized. Currently it only\nsupports
  using [`singleton`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/singletons) types as\ntype-indexes.\n\n>
  TODO: Support for non-singleton-types types with kind `*` using `Typeable` should\n>
  be possible, but I haven't worked on that yet. It's on the roadmap.\n\nIn short,
  what `exinst` currently gives you is: For any type ``t :: k -> *``,\nif `k` is a
  singleton type and `c (t k) :: Constraint` is satisfied, then you can\nexistentialize
  away the `k` parameter with `Some1 t`, and have `c (Some1 t)`\nautomatically satisfied.
  Currently, up to 4 type indexes can be existentialized\nusing `Some1`, `Some2`,
  `Some3` and `Some4` respectively.\n\n> NOTE: This tutorial asumes some familiarity
  with singleton types as implemented\n> by the [`singleton`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/singletons)
  library.\n> A singleton type is, in very rough terms, a type inhabited by a single
  term,\n> which allows one to go from its term-level representation to its type-level\n>
  representation and back without much trouble. A bit like the term `()`, which\n>
  is of type `()`: whenever you have the type `()` you know what that its\n> term-level
  representation must be `()`, and whenever you have the term `()`\n> you know that
  its type must be `()`.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs a motivation, let's consider the following
  example:\n\n```haskell\n{-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}\n{-#
  LANGUAGE KindSignatures #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE StandaloneDeriving
  #-}\n\ndata Size = Big | Small\n\ndata Receptacle (a :: Size) :: * where\n  Vase
  :: Receptacle 'Small\n  Glass :: Receptacle 'Small\n  Barrel :: Receptacle 'Big\n\nderiving
  instance Show (Receptacle a)\n```\n\n`Receptacle` can describe three types of receptacles
  (`Vase`, `Glass` and\n`Barrel`), while at the same time being able to indicate,
  at the type level,\nwhether the size of the receptacle is `Big` or `Small`. Additionally,
  we've\nprovided `Show` instances for `Receptacle`.\n\nNow, if we want to put `Receptacle`s
  in a container, for example in `[]`, we can\ndo so only as long as the `Receptacle`
  type is fully applied and monomorphic. That is, we can\nhave `[Receptacle 'Small]`
  and `[Receptacle 'Big]`, but we can't have\n`[Receptacle]` nor `[forall a. Receptacle
  a]`. So, if we want to have `Receptacle`s of different sizes in a\ncontainer like
  `[]`, we need a different solution.\n\nAt this point we need to ask ourselves why
  we need to put `Receptacle`s of\ndifferent sizes in a same container. If the answer
  is something like “because we\nwant to show all of them, no matter what size they
  are”, then we should realize\nthat what we are actually asking for is that no matter
  what `Size` our\n`Receptable` has, we need to be able to find a `Show` instance
  for that\n`Receptacle`. In Haskell, we can express just that using existential types\nand
  constraints hidden behind a data constructor.\n\n```haskell\n--We need to add these
  language extensions to the ones in the previous example\n--{-# LANGUAGE ExistentialQuantification
  #-}\n--{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-}\n\ndata ReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown\n
  \ = forall a. (Show (Receptacle a))\n      => MkReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown
  (Receptacle a)\n```\n\nWe can construct values of type `ReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown`
  only as long\nas there exist a `Show` instance for the `Receptacle a` we give to
  the\n`MkReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown` constructor. In our case, both `Receptacle\n'Small`
  and `Receptacle 'Big` have `Show` instances, so all of `Vase`, `Glass` and\n`Barrel`
  can be used successfully with `MkReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown`.\n\nNow, `ReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown`
  on itself doesn't yet have a `Show`\ninstance, and we can't derive one automatically
  using the `deriving` mechanism,\nbut we can give an explicit `Show` instance that
  just forwards the work to the\n`Show` instance of the underlying `Receptacle a`.\n\n```haskell\ninstance
  Show ReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown where\n  show (MkReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown
  a) = show a\n```\n\nThat works as intended:\n\n```\n> show (MkReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown
  Vase)\n\"Vase\"\n> show (MkReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown Barrel)\n\"Barrel\"\n```\n\nAnd
  now, as we wanted, we can put `Receptacle`s of different sizes in a `[]` and\nshow
  them (as long as we wrap each of them as\n`ReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown`, that
  is).\n\n```\n> map show [MkReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown Vase, MkReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown
  Barrel]\n[\"Vase\", \"Barrel\"]\n```\n\nHowever, the above solution is unsatisfying
  for various reasons: For one, the\n`Show` instance for `ReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown`
  works only as long as\nthe `ReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown` itself carries a
  witness that the `Show`\nconstraint for `Receptacle a` is satisfied, which means
  that if we want to write\nyet another instance for `ReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown`
  that simply forwards\nits implementation to the underlying `Receptacle a`, say `Eq`,
  then the\n`MkReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown` constructor would need to be modified
  to witness\nthe `Eq (Receptacle a)` instance too:\n\n```haskell\ndata ReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown\n
  \ = forall a. (Show (Receptacle a), Eq (Receptacle a))\n      => MkReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown
  (Receptacle a)\n```\n\nWith that in place we can provide an `Eq` instance for\n`ReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown`
  as we did for `Show` before, but if we pay\nclose attention, we can see how the
  implementation of\n`ReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown` starts to become a bottleneck:
  Every\ninstance we want to provide for `ReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown` that
  simply\nforwards its work to the underlying `Receptacle a` needs to be witnessed
  by\n`MkReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown` itself, it is not enough that there exists\nan
  instance for `Receptacle a`. Moreover, even the name\n`ReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown`
  that we chose before isn't completely\naccurate anymore, and will become less and
  less accurate as we continue adding\nconstraints to `MkReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown`.\n\nAdditionally,
  everywhere we use the `MkReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown`\nconstructor we need
  to witness that the existentialized `Receptacle a` satisfies\nall the required constraints,
  which means that, if the `Receptacle a` we pass to\n`MkReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown`
  is being received, say, as a parameter to\na function, then the type of that function
  will also require that its caller\nsatisfies all of the same constraints, even though
  it is obvious to us,\nstatically, that the instances exist. We can now see how all
  of this becomes\nunmanegeable, or at least very *boilerplatey*, as those constraints
  start to\npropagate through our code base.\n\nWhat we need is a way for instances
  such as the `Show` instance for\n`ReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown` to find the
  `Show` instance for `Receptacle\na` without it being explicitely witnessed by the\n`MkReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown`
  constructor. That is exactly the problem\nthat `exinst` solves: allowing *exi*stentials
  to find their *inst*ances.\n\n\n## Usage\n\nGiven the code for `Size`, `Receptacle`
  and its `Show` instances above, we can\nachieve the same functionality as our initial
  `ReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown` by\nexistentializing the type indexes of `Receptacle
  'Small` and `Receptacle 'Big`\nas `Some1 Receptacle`. In order to do that, we must
  first ensure that `Size` and its\nconstructors can be used as singleton types (as
  supported by the `singletons` library),\nfor which we can use some TH provided by
  `Data.Singletons.TH`:\n\n```haskell\nimport Data.Singletons.TH\n\nData.Singletons.TH.genSingletons
  [''Size]\n```\n\nAnd we'll also need a `Show` instance for `Size` for reasons that
  will become\napparent later:\n\n```haskell\nderiving instance Show Size\n```\n\nNow
  we can construct a `Show1 Size` and `show` achieving the same results as we\ndid
  with `ReceptacleOfAnySizeThatCanBeShown` before.\n\nNote: this code won't work yet.
  Keep reading.\n\n```\n> import Exinst (some1)\n> import Exinst.Instances.Base ()\n>
  :t some1 Glass\n:t some1 Glass :: Some1 Receptacle\n> show (some1 Glass)\n\"Some1
  Small Glass\"\n```\n\nWell, actually, the default `Show` instance for `Some1` shows
  a bit more of\ninformation, as it permits this string to be `Read` back into a `Some1\nReceptacle`
  if needed, but displaying just `\"Glass\"` would be possible too, if\ndesired.\n\n>
  TODO: Implement said `Read` instance.\n\nThe important thing to notice in the example
  above is that `some1` does not\nrequire us to satisfy a `Show (Receptacle 'Small)`
  constraint, it just requires\nthat the type index for the type-indexed type we give
  it as argument is a\nsingleton type:\n\n```haskell\nsome1 :: forall (f1 :: k1 ->
  *) (a1 :: k1). SingI a1 => f1 a1 -> Some1 f1\n```\n\nIt is the application of `show`
  to `some1 Glass` which will fail to compile if\nthere isn't a `Show` instance for
  `Receptacle 'Small`, complaining that a `Show`\ninstance for `Some1 Receptable`
  can't be found. The reason for this is that even\nif `Show` instances for `Some1`
  are derived for free, they are only derived for\n`Some1 (t :: k1 -> *)` where a
  `Show (t a)` for a specific but statically\nunknown `a` can be found at runtime
  (mostly, there are other minor requirements too).\nThe mechanism through which instances
  are found at runtime relies on `Dict` from the\n[`constraints`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/constraints)
  library, which\n`exinst` wraps in a `Dict1` typeclass to be instantiated once per
  singleton\ntype.\n\n```haskell\n-- The Exinst.Dict1 class\nclass Dict1 (c :: * ->
  Constraint) (f1 :: k1 -> *) where\n  dict1 :: Sing (a1 :: k1) -> Dict (c (f1 a1))\n```\n\nWhat
  `Dict1` says is that: for a type-indexed type `f1`, given a term-level\nrepresentation
  of the singleton type that indexes said `f1`, we can obtain a\nwitness that the
  constraint `c` is satisfied by `f1` applied to the singleton\ntype.\n\nThat class
  seems to be a bit too abstract, but the instances we as users need to\nwrite for
  it are quite silly and straightforward. Even *boilerplatey* if you\nwill; they could
  even be generated using TH\n\n> TODO: Write the TH for deriving the `Dict{1,2,3,4}`
  implementation.\n\nHere's an example of how to provide `Show` support for `Some1
  Receptacle` via\n`Dict1`:\n\n```\ninstance (Show (Receptacle 'Small), Show (Receptacle
  'Big)) => Dict1 Show Receptacle where\n  dict1 = \\x -> case x of\n    SSmall ->
  Dict\n    SBig -> Dict\n```\n\nThe implementation of `dict1` looks quite silly,
  but it has to look like that as\nit is only by pattern-matching on each of the `Sing
  Size` constructors that we\nlearn about the type level representation of a singleton
  type, which we then use\nto select the proper `Show` instance among all of those
  listed in the instance head.\n\nGiven this `Dict1` instance, we can proceed to excecute
  the REPL example mentioned before\nand it will work just fine.\n\nHowever, that
  `Dict1` instance is still a bit insatisfactory: If we wanted,\nagain, to provide
  `Eq` support for our `Some1 Receptacle` type, we would need to\nwrite yet another
  `Dict1` instance like the one above, but mentioning `Eq`\ninstead of `Show`. We
  can do better.\n\nThe trick, when writing `Dict1` instances such as the one above,
  is to leave `c`\nand `f1 :: k1 -> *` completely polymorphic, and instead only talk
  concretely\nabout the singleton type with kind `k1`. This might sound strange at
  first, as\n`c` and `f1` are the only two type parameters to `Dict1`. But as it often
  happens\nwhen working with singleton types, we are not particularly interested in
  the\ntypes involved, but in their kinds instead. So, this is the `Dict1` instance\nyou
  often want to write:\n\n```haskell\ninstance (c (f1 'Small), c (f1 'Big)) => Dict1
  c f1 where\n  dict1 = \\x -> case x of\n    SSmall -> Dict\n    SBig -> Dict\n```\n\nThat
  instance says that for any choice of `c` and `f1 :: Size -> *`, if an\ninstance
  for `c (f1 a)` exists for a specific choice of `a`, then, given a term\nlevel representation
  for that `a` and the aid of `dict1`, said instance can be\nlooked up at runtime.\n\nNotice
  that `Some1` itself doesn't have any requirements about `Dict1`, it's the\nvarious
  instances for `Some1` who rely on `Dict1`. `Dict1` has nothing to do\nwith `Some1`,
  nor with the choice of `f` nor with the choice of `c`; it is only\nrelated to the
  singleton type used as a type-index for `f`.\n\nThe `Exinst` module exports ready-made
  instances for `Some1`, `Some2`, `Some3`\nand `Some4` (they can be enabled with some
  cabal flags).\n\n* `Eq`, `Ord`, `Show` from the `base` package.\n\n* `FromJSON`
  and `ToJSON` from the `aeson` package.\n\n* `Serial` from the `bytes` package.\n\n*
  `Hashable` from the `hashable` package.\n\n* `NFData` from the `deepseq` package.\n\n*
  `Arbitrary` from the `QuickCheck` package.\n\nYou are invited to read the instance
  heads for said instances so as to understand\nwhat you need to provide in order
  to get those instances “for free”. As a rule of\nthumb, most instances will require
  this: If you expect to have an instance for\n`class Y => Z a` satisfied for `Some1
  (f :: k -> *)`, then make sure an instance\nfor `Z` is available for the `DemoteRep
  ('KProxy :: KProxy k)`, that a `Dict1 Z\n(f :: k -> *)` or more general instance
  exists, and that the `Y` instance for\n`Some1 (f :: k -> *)` exists too.\n\nHere
  is the full code needed to have, say, the `Eq`, `Show`, `ToJSON` and\n`FromJSON`
  instances available for `Some1 Receptacle`:\n\n```haskell\n{-# LANGUAGE ConstraintKinds

  provided that we import `Exinst.Instances.Base` and\n`Exinst.Instances.Aeson`, `Some1
  Receptacle` will have `Eq`, `Show`, `FromJSON`\nand `FromJSON` instances:\n\n```\n>

  Ae.decode (Ae.encode (some1 Vase)) == Just (some1 Vase)\nTrue\n> Ae.decode (Ae.encode
  (some1 Vase)) == Just (some1 Glass)\nFalse\n```\n\n\n## About `Some2`, `Some3` and
  `Some4`.\n\nJust like `Some1` hides the last singleton type index from fully applied\ntype-indexed
  type, `Some2` hides the last two type indexes, `Some3` hides the\nlast three, and
  `Some3` hides the last four. They can be used in the same way as\n`Some1`.\n\nLike
  as most instances for `Some1` require `Dict1` instances to be present for\ntheir
  singleton type-index, most instances for `Some2`, `Some3` and `Some4` will\nrequire
  that `Dict2`, `Dict3` or `Dict4` instances exist, respectively. Writing\nthese instances
  is very straightforward. Supposing you have a type `X :: T4 ->\nT3 -> T2 -> T1 ->
  *` and want to existentialize all of the four type indexes yet\nbe able to continue
  using all of its instances, we can write something like\nthis:\n\n```haskell\ninstance
  (c (f1 'T1a), c (f1 'T1b)) => Dict1 c (f1 :: T1 -> *) where\n  dict1 = \\x -> case
  x of { ST1a -> Dict; ST1b -> Dict }\ninstance (Dict1 c (f2 'T2a), Dict1 c (f2 'T2b))
  => Dict2 c (f2 :: T2 -> k1 -> *) where\n  dict2 = \\x -> case x of { ST2a -> dict1;
  ST2b -> dict1 }\ninstance (Dict2 c (f3 'T3a), Dict2 c (f3 'T3b)) => Dict3 c (f3
  :: T3 -> k2 -> k1 -> *) where\n  dict3 = \\x -> case x of { ST3a -> dict2; ST3b
  -> dict2 }\ninstance (Dict3 c (f4 'T4a), Dict3 c (f4 'T4b)) => Dict4 c (f4 :: T4
  -> k3 -> k2 -> k1 -> *) where\n  dict4 = \\x -> case x of { ST4a -> dict3; ST4b
  -> dict3 }\n```\n\nThat is, assuming the following `T1`, `T2`, `T3` and `T4`:\n\n```haskell\ndata
  T4 = T4a | T4b\ndata T3 = T3a | T3b\ndata T2 = T2a | T2b\ndata T1 = T1a | T1b\n```\n\nEffectively,
  we wrote just one instance per singleton type per type-index\nposition, each of
  them promoting a term-level representation of a singleton\ntype to its type-level
  representation and forwarding the rest of the work to\na “smaller” dict. That is,
  `dict4` reifies the type of the fourth-to-last\ntype-index of `X` and then calls
  `dict3` to do the same for the third-to-last\ntype-index of `X` and so on. Notice,
  however, how we didn't need to mention `X`\nin none of the instances above: As we
  said before, these instances are\nintended to work for any choice of `c`, `f4`,
  `f3`, `f2` and `f1`.\n\n> TODO: See if instead of having `Some1`, `Some2`, `Some3`,
  `Some4`, and their\n> respective `Dict1`, `Dict2`, `Dict3` and `Dict4`, etc., we
  can have a single\n> `SomeN` and a single `DictN` working out the number of parameters
  using\n> type-level natural numbers.\n\n## Converting `Some1 (f :: k -> *)` to `f
  (a :: k)`.\n\nIf you have a `Some1 (f :: k -> *)` and you know, statically, that
  you need an\nspecific `f (a :: k)`, then you can use `fromSome1` which will give
  you an\n`f (a :: k)` only if `a` was the type that was existentialized by `Some1`.\nUsing
  `fromSome1` requires that the singleton type-index implements\n`Data.Singletons.Decide.SDecide`,
  which can be derived mechanically with TH by\nmeans of `Data.Singletons.TH.singInstance`.\n\nIf
  you don't know, statically, the type of `f (a :: k)`, then you can use\n`withSome1Sing`
  or `withSome1` to work with `f (a :: k)` as long as `a` never\nleaves their scope
  (don't worry, the compiler will yell at you if you try to do\nthat).\n\n\n# Library
  implementors: Writing instances for `Some1` and friends.\n\nInstances for `Some1`
  seem to come out of thin air, but the truth is that they\nneed to be written at
  least once by library authors so that, provided all its\nrequirements are satisfied,
  they are made available.\n\nWhen we imported `Exinst.Instances.Base` before, we
  brought to scope, among\nother things, the `Show` instance for `Some1`, which is
  defined as this:\n\n```haskell\n-- Internal wrapper so that we don't have to write
  the string manipulation parts\n-- in the 'Show' instance by hand.\ndata Some1'Show
  r1 x = Some1 r1 x deriving (Show)\n\ninstance forall (f1 :: k1 -> *)\n  . ( SingKind
  ('KProxy :: KProxy k1)\n    , Show (DemoteRep ('KProxy :: KProxy k1))\n    , Dict1
  Show f1\n    ) => Show (Some1 f1)\n  where\n    showsPrec n = \\some1 -> withSome1Sing
  some1 $ \\sa1 (x :: f1 a1) ->\n       case dict1 sa1 :: Dict (Show (f1 a1)) of\n
  \         Dict -> showsPrec n (Some1 (fromSing sa1) x)\n```\n\nThis code should
  be relatively straightforward if you are familiar with uses of\nthe `singletons`
  and `constraints` libraries. We are simply reifying singleton\ntypes from their
  term-level representation to their type-level representation,\nand afterwards using
  the `Dict1` mechanism to lookup the required instances\nduring runtime. Additionaly,
  this instance requires that the term level\nrepresentation of the singleton type
  implements `Show` too, as, like we saw in a\nprevious example, the type index itself
  is shown in this `Show` implementation,\nin the hope that it can be later recovered
  and reified to the type level when\nusing `Read`.\n\n\n"
