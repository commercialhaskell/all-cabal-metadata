  This package wraps the venerable eggtraymanager code, which implements
  the freedesktop.org
  [system tray protocol](http://standards.freedesktop.org/systemtray-spec/systemtray-spec-0.2.html).
  The code seems to have originated somewhere in the GNOME project a
  long time ago; I took it from
  [trayer-srg](https://github.com/sargon/trayer-srg/).  The only change
  I made was to cast a few `long` variables in parameters to `uint64_t`
  to make interoperability with Haskell easier.

  By itself, this code is not a system tray widget.  It is, however, an
  integral part of one.  This package exports a simple GObject (for use
  with gtk2hs) that emits events when system tray events occur.  A
  system tray widget would listen for these events and respond.  See the
  haddock documentation for details.
