description: |-
  This package contains a type class called Cast with a function cast, that is a
  wrapper for all the castTo* functions of gtk2hs.  It makes it easier to write
  other functions that require a castTo* as a parameter, like xmlGetWidget from
  glade.  The main utility of these packages is to use xmlGetWidgetCast, a
  version of xmlGetWidget defined in gtk2hs-cast-glade, which has the type:
  xmlGetWidgetCast :: (Cast widget, WidgetClass widget) => GladeXML -> String ->
  IO widget.

  This is the gtkglext package of gtk2hs-cast, which contains the instances of
  Cast for the types in the gtkglext package from gtk2hs.
