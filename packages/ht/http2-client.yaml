description: "# http2-client\n\nAn native-Haskell HTTP2 client library based on `http2`
  and `tls` packages.\n\nHackage: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/http2-client
  .\n\n## General design\n\nHTTP2 is a heavy protocol. HTTP2 features pipelining,
  query and responses\ninterleaving, server-pushes, pings, stateful compression and
  flow-control,\npriorization etc. This library aims at exposing these features so
  that library\nusers can integrate `http2-client` in a variety of applications. In
  short, we'd\nlike to expose as many HTTP2 features as possible. Hence, the `http2-client`\nprogramming
  interface can feel low-level for users with expectations to get an\nAPI as simple
  as in HTTP1.x.\n\nExposing most HTTP2 primitives as a drawback: the library allows
  a client to\nbehave abnormally with-respect to the HTTP2 spec. That said, we try
  to prevent\nnotoriously-difficult errors such as concurrency bugs by coercing users
  with\nthe programming API following Haskell's philosophy to factor-out errors at\ncompile
  time. For instance, a client can send DATA frames on a stream after\nclosing it
  with a RST (easy to spot). However, a multi-threaded client will not\nbe able to
  interleave DATA frames with HEADERS and their CONTINUATIONs and the\nlocking required
  to achieve this invariant is hidden (hard to implement).\n\nFollowing this philosophy,
  we prefer to offer a somewhat low-level API in\n`Network.HTTP2.Client` and higher-level
  APIs (with a different performance\ntrade-off) in `Network.HTTP2.Client.Helpers`.
  For instance,\n`Network.HTTP2.Client.Helpers.waitStream` will consume a whole stream
  in memory\nbefore returning whereas `Network.HTTP2.Client` users will have to take
  chunks\none at a time. We look forward to the linear arrows extension for improving
  the\nlibrary design.\n\n### Versioning and GHC support\n\nWe try to follow https://pvp.haskell.org/
  as `a.b.c.d` with the caveat that if\n`a=0` then we are still slightly unhappy with
  some APIs and we'll break things\narbitrarily.\n\nWe aim at supporting GHC-8.x,
  contributions to support GHC-7.x are welcome.\n\n### Installation\n\nThis package
  is a standard `Stack` project, please also refer to Stack's\ndocumentation if you
  have trouble installing or using this package.  Please\nalso have a look at the
  Hackage Matrix CI:\nhttps://matrix.hackage.haskell.org/package/http2-client .\n\n##
  Usage\n\nFirst, make sure you are somewhat familiar with HTTP and HTTP2 standards
  by\nreading RFCs or Wikipedia pages. If you use the library, feel free to shoot
  me\nan e-mail (cf. commits) or a tweet @lucasdicioccio .\n\n### Help and examples\n\nPlease
  see some literate Haskell documents in the `examples/` directory.  For\na more involved
  usage, we currently provide a command-line example client:\n`http2-client-exe` which
  I use as a test client and you could use to test\nvarious flow-control parameters.
  This binary lives in a separate package\nat https://github.com/lucasdicioccio/http2-client-exe
  .\n\nThe Haddocks, at https://hackage.haskell.org/package/http2-client, should have\nplenty
  implementation details, so please have a look.  Otherwise, you can ask\nhelp by
  creating an Issue on the bug-tracker.\n\n### Opening a stream\n\nFirst, you open
  a (TLS-protected) connection to a server and configure the\ninitial SETTINGS to
  advertise. Then you can open and consume streams. Opening\nstreams takes a stream-definition
  and expresses two sequential parts. First,\nsending the HTTP headers, which reserves
  an increasing stream-ID with the\nserver. Second, you consume a stream by sending
  DATA chunk or receiving DATA\nchunks. One thing that can prevent concurrency is
  if you have too many opened\nstreams for the server. The `http2-client` library
  tracks server's max\nconcurrency preference and will prevent you from opening too
  many streams.\n\n### Sending chunked data\n\nSent data must be chunked according
  to server's preferences. A function named\n`sendData` performs the chunking but
  this chunking could have some suboptimal\noverhead if you want to repeatedly call
  sendData with a buffer size that is not\na multiple of the server's preferred chunk
  size.\n\n### Flow control\n\nHTTP2 mandates a flow-control system that cannot be
  disabled. DATA chunks\nconsume credit from the flow-control system. The standard
  defines a\nflow-control context per stream plus one global per-connection. \n\n**
  Received DATA flow control ** In order to keep receiving data you need to\nperiodically
  transfer credit to the server. One transfers credit to server by\ncalling `_updateWindow`,
  which transfers locally-accumulated credit (you\naccumulate credit with `addCredit`).
  The current implementation already follows\na \"zero-sum\" credit where received
  DATA is immediately consumed and\nre-credited.  That is, if you only keep calling
  `_updateWindow` at some\nfrequency the stream will progress. You can also `_addCredit`
  to permit\nreceiving more DATA on a stream/connection (e.g., if you want to implement\nsomething
  like TCP slow-start).\n\n** Sent DATA flow control ** A server following the HTTP2
  specification\nstrictly will kick you for sending too much data. The `http2-client`
  library\nallows you to be more aggressive than the server allows and you have to
  care\nfor your streams. We provide an incoming flow-control context that will allow\nyou
  to call `_withdrawCredit` to wait until some credit is available. At the\ntime of
  this writing, the `sendData` function does not call `_withdrawCredit`\nand we provide
  no equivalent. Note that the chunking and flow-control\nmechanisms have interesting
  interactions in HTTP2 in a multi-threaded context.\nPay attention to always take
  credit in the per-stream flow-control context\nbefore taking it from the global
  per-connection flow-control context.\nOtherwise, you risk starving the global per-connection
  flow-control with no\nguarantee that you'll be allowed to send a DATA frame.\n\n##
  Settings changes\n\nThe HTTP2 RFC acknowledges the inherent race conditions that
  may occur when\nchanging SETTINGS. The `http2-client` library should be rather permissive
  and\naccept rather than reject frames caught violating inconsistent settings once\nclient
  settings are made stricter. Conversely, the `http2-client` library tries\nto enforce
  server-SETTINGS strictly before ACKnowledging the setting changes.\nThis configuration
  can lead to problems if the server send more-permissive\nSETTINGS (e.g., allowing
  a large default window size -> which recredits all\nstreams) but if the server applies
  this change locally only after receiving the\nclient ACK. One way to be double-sure
  the `http2-client` library is always\nstrict would be to apply settings changes
  in two steps: settings that move in\nthe \"stricter direction\" (e.g., fewer concurrency,
  smaller initial window)\nshould be applied _before_ ACK-ing the SETTING frame. Meanwhile
  settings that\nmove in the \"looser direction\" (e.g., more concurrency) should
  be applied\n_after_ ACK-ing the SETTINGS frame.\n\nThe current design apply SETTINGS:\n-
  (client prefs) after receiving a ACK for sent SETTINGS, you get the choice to\n
  \ wait for an ACK or wait in a thread, but you must wait for an ACK to apply\n  changed
  settings (the `_settings` function will return an IO to wait for the\n  ACK and
  apply settings). Note that the initial SETTINGS change frame is\n  waited for in
  a thread without library's user intervention (if you feel\n  strongly against this
  choice, please open a bug).\n- (server prefs) immediately after receiving and hence
  before sending ACK-SETTINGS\n\nFortunately, changing settings mid-stream is probably
  a rare behavior and the\ndefault SETTINGS are large enough to avoid creating fatal
  errors before\nsending/receiving the initial SETTINGS frames.\n\n## Things that
  are hardcoded\n\nA number of HTTP2 features are currently hardcoded:\n- PINGs are
  replied-to immediately (i.e., a server could hog a connection with PINGs)\n- the
  initial SETTINGS frame sent to the server is waited-for in a separate\n  thread,
  settings are applied to the connection when the server ACKs the frame\n- flow-control
  from DATA frames is decremented immediately when received (in a\n  separate thread)
  rather than when consumed from the client\n- similarly, flow-control re-increment
  every DATA received as soon as it is\n  received\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions
  are welcome. As I start integrating external contribution I plan\nto follow the
  following procedure:\n- stop pushing directly into master\n- develop any patch in
  a new branch, branched from master\n- merge requests target master\n\nPlease pay
  attention to the following:\n- avoid introducing external dependencies, especially
  if dependencies are not in stackage\n- avoid reformatting-only merge requests\n-
  please verify that you can `stack clean` and `stack build --pedantic`\n\nGeneral
  mindset to have during code-reviews:\n- be kind\n- be patient\n- surpass egos and
  bring data if there is a disagreement\n\n## Bugtracker\n\nMost of the following
  points have their own issues on the issue tracker at\nGitHub: https://github.com/lucasdicioccio/http2-client/issues
  .\n\n### Things that will likely change the API\n\nI think the fundamentals are
  right but the following needs tweaking:\n\n- function to reset a stream will likely
  be blocking until a RST/EndStream is\n  received so that all DATA frames are accounted
  for in the flow-control system\n- need a way to hook custom flow-control algorithms\n\n###
  Support of the HTTP2 standard\n\nThe current implementation follows the HTTP2 standard
  except for the following:\n- does not handle `PRIORITY`\n- does not expose padding\n-
  does not handle `SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE`\n  * it's unclear to me whether
  this limitation is applied per frame or in total\n  * the accounting is done before
  compression with 32 extra bytes per header\n- does not implement most of the checks
  that should trigger protocol errors\n  * unwanted frames on idle/closed streams\n
  \ * increasing IDs only\n  * invalid settings\n  * invalid window in flow-control\n
  \ * invalid frame sizes\n  * data-consumed out of flow-control limits\n  * authority
  of push promise https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-http2-17#section-10.1\n
  \ * ...\n"
