synopsis: An HTTP client using io-streams
changelog: "* _v0.8.6_  \n\tInternal modules are exposed. Mostly so the test suite
  would only\n\tdepend on the library and not the code directly, but occasionally\n\tsomeone
  needed to poke at the internals. Usual warning against\n\tdoing that applies. They
  are _not_ visible in the generated Haddock\n\tdocumentation.\n\n* _v0.8.4_  \n\tSupport
  GHC 8.0\n\n* _v0.8.3_  \n\tA pure version of `buildRequest` is now available as
  `buildRequest1`.\n\tSupport for connecting to Unix domain sockets has been added.\n\n*
  _v0.7.0_  \n\tThe Request, Response, Headers, and RequestBuilder types have been\n\tfactored
  out and moved to **http-common**. They are still exported\n\tby **http-streams**.\n\n*
  _v0.6.0_  \n\tEntity body lengths (both for Requests and Responses) now Int64.\n\tLibrary
  depends on **io-streams** 1.1.\n\n* _v0.5.0_  \n\tDefinition of Hostname and Port
  have been changed to ByteString\n\tand Word16, respectively.\n\n* _v0.4.0_  \n\tType
  signature of `buildRequest` changed, removing the Connection\n\tparameter. This
  allows you to construct Request objects before\n\topening a connection to the web
  server if you wish.\n\n* _v0.3.1_  \n\tInitial public release\n"

description: "An HTTP client\n==============\n\nAn HTTP client library for Haskell
  using the Snap Framework's\n[io-streams](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/io-streams)
  library to handle\nthe streaming IO.\n\nA common case in writing RESTful web services
  is needing to make onward calls\nto further servers. This package is intended to
  make this easy to do.\nThough originally written for making calls from web apps
  written with\nSnap, you can use this from any library or framework.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nExample\n-------\n\nThe
  underlying API is very simple:\n\n```haskell\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n    c <-
  openConnection \"www.example.com\" 80\n    \n    let q = buildRequest1 $ do\n                http
  GET \"/\"\n                setAccept \"text/html\"\n    \n    sendRequest c q emptyBody\n
  \   \n    receiveResponse c (\\p i -> do\n    \tputStr $ show p\n\n    \tx <- Streams.read
  i\n    \tS.putStr $ fromMaybe \"\" x)\n    \n    closeConnection c\n```\n\nThere
  are also convenience functions for the common case of making\nstraight-forward GET
  and POST requests; for instance:\n\n```haskell\n    get \"http://www.example.com/\"
  (\\_ i -> Streams.connect i stdout)\n```\n\nwill _{ahem}_ stream the response body
  to stdout. Perhaps more\ninteresting (though less streams-oriented), is simply getting
  the\nresponse as a ByteString using one of the pre-defined handlers:\n\n```haskell\n
  \   x' <- get \"https://secure.example.com/\" concatHandler\n```\n\nSee the documentation
  in\n[Network.Http.Client](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-streams/docs/Network-Http-Client.html)\nfor
  further examples and details of usage of the API. There's also a [blog\npost](http://blogs.operationaldynamics.com/andrew/software/haskell/http-streams-introduction)\nintroducing
  the library with a discussion of the design and usage.\n\nChange Log\n----------\n\nNow
  included in separate file [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).\n\nAfC\n\n"
