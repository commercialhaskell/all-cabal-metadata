synopsis: An HTTP client using io-streams
changelog: ! "* _v0.8.4_  \n\tSupport GHC 8.\n\n* _v0.8.3_  \n\tA pure version of
  `buildRequest` is now available as `buildRequest1`.\n\tSupport for connecting to
  Unix domain sockets has been added.\n\n* _v0.7.0_  \n\tThe Request, Response, Headers,
  and RequestBuilder types have been\n\tfactored out and moved to **http-common**.
  They are still exported\n\tby **http-streams**.\n\n* _v0.6.0_  \n\tEntity body lengths
  (both for Requests and Responses) now Int64.\n\tLibrary depends on **io-streams**
  1.1.\n\n* _v0.5.0_  \n\tDefinition of Hostname and Port have been changed to ByteString\n\tand
  Word16, respectively.\n\n* _v0.4.0_  \n\tType signature of `buildRequest` changed,
  removing the Connection\n\tparameter. This allows you to construct Request objects
  before\n\topening a connection to the web server if you wish.\n\n* _v0.3.1_  \n\tInitial
  public release\n"

description: ! "An HTTP client\n==============\n\nAn HTTP client library for Haskell
  using the Snap Framework's\n[io-streams](https://github.com/snapframework/io-streams)
  library to\nhandle the streaming IO.\n<!-- replace with link to hackage when it
  is released -->\n\nA common case in writing RESTful web services is needing to make
  onward calls\nto further servers. This package is intended to make this easy to
  do.\nThough originally written for making calls from wep apps written with\nSnap,
  you can use this from any library or framework.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nExample\n-------\n\nThe
  underlying API is very simple:\n\n```haskell\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n    c <-
  openConnection \"www.example.com\" 80\n    \n    let q = buildRequest1 $ do\n                http
  GET \"/\"\n                setAccept \"text/html\"\n    \n    sendRequest c q emptyBody\n
  \   \n    receiveResponse c (\\p i -> do\n    \tputStr $ show p\n\n    \tx <- Streams.read
  i\n    \tS.putStr $ fromMaybe \"\" x)\n    \n    closeConnection c\n```\n\nThere
  are also convenience functions for the common case of making\nstraight-forward GET
  and POST requests; for instance:\n\n```haskell\n    get \"http://www.example.com/\"
  (\\_ i -> Streams.connect i stdout)\n```\n\nwill _{ahem}_ stream the response body
  to stdout. Perhaps more\ninteresting (though less streams-oriented), is simply getting
  the\nresponse as a ByteString using one of the pre-defined handlers:\n\n```haskell\n
  \   x' <- get \"https://secure.example.com/\" concatHandler\n```\n\nSee the documentation
  in\n[Network.Http.Client](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-streams/docs/Network-Http-Client.html)\nfor
  further examples and details of usage of the API. There's also a [blog\npost](http://blogs.operationaldynamics.com/andrew/software/haskell/http-streams-introduction)\nintroducing
  the library with a discussion of the design and usage.\n\nChange Log\n----------\n\nNow
  included in separate file [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.markdown).\n\nAfC\n\n"
