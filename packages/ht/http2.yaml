  # ChangeLog for http2

  ## 5.3.3

  * Enclosing IPv6 literal authority with square brackets.
    [#143](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/143)

  ## 5.3.2

  * Avoid unnecessary empty data frames at end of stream
    [#140](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/140)
  * Removing unnecessary API from ServerIO

  ## 5.3.1

  * Fix treatment of async exceptions
    [#138](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/138)
  * Avoid race condition
    [#137](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/137)

  ## 5.3.0

  * New server architecture: spawning worker on demand instead of the
    worker pool. This reduce huge numbers of threads for streaming into
    only 2. No API changes but workers do not terminate quicly. Rather
    workers collaborate with the sender after queuing a response and
    finish after all response data are sent.
  * All threads are labeled with `labelThread`. You can see them by
    `listThreas` if necessary.

  ## 5.2.6

  * Recover rxflow on closing.
    [#126](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/126)
  * Fixing ClientSpec for stream errors.
  * Allowing negative window. (h2spec http2/6.9.2)
  * Update for latest http-semantics
    [#122](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/124)

  ## 5.2.5

  * Setting peer initial window size properly.
    [#123](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/123)

  ## 5.2.4

  * Update for latest http-semantics
    [#122](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/122)
  * Measuring performance concurrently for h2c-client

  ## 5.2.3

  * Update for latest http-semantics
    [#120](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/120)
  * Enable containers 0.7 (ghc 9.10)
    [#117](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/117)

  ## 5.2.0

  * Using http-semantics
    [#114](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/114)
  * `Header` of `http-types` should be used as high-level header.
  * `TokenHeader` of `http-semantics` should be used as low-level header.
  * Breaking change: `encodeHeader` takes `Header` of `http-types`.
  * Breaking change: `decodeHeader` returns `Header` of `http-types`.
  * Breaking change: `HeaderName` as `ByteString` is removed.

  ## 5.1.4

  * Fixing two bugs of HPACK pointed out by h2spec v2.

  ## 1.6.2

  * Improving the performance of HPACK.
  * Huffman encoding is now based on H2O's one.

  ## 1.6.1

  * Improving the performance of HPACK.

  ## 1.6.0

  * Reverse indices of HPACK are now based on tokens.
  * New APIs: encodeTokenHeader and decodeTokenHeader.
  * Deleted API: encodeHeaderBuffer -- use encodeTokenHeader instead.

  * Adding debug information.

  ## 1.5.2

  * Minor optimization for HPACK.

  ## 1.5.1

  * Adding a missing file for testing.

  ## 1.5.0

  * New API for HPACK. HPACK is much faster than 1.4.x (roughly x3.2).
    The default encoding is now Linear instead of LinearH.

  ## 1.4.5

  * Removing zero reset from priority queues.

  ## 1.4.4

  * Fixing a bug of reverse index.

  ## 1.4.3

  * Priority benchmark is now external information versions.
  * Using proper baseDeficit for deletion.

  ## 1.4.2

  * Test files are now self-contained.

  ## 1.4.1

  * The reverse indices for static and dynamic are combined for performance.

  ## 1.4.0

  * Providing dequeueSTM, isEmpty and isEmptySTM. Users can compose
    their own control queue with dequeueSTM and isEmptySTM.

  * Removing enqueueControl: it appeared that PriorityTree is not
    suitable for control frames. 　For example, the dependency of all
    control frames is stream 0.  So, PSQ does not contain multiple
    control frames at the same time.  We removed enqueueControl. Users
    should prepare a queue for control frames by themselves.

  ## 1.3.1

  * Defining IllegalTableSizeUpdate.

  ## 1.3.0

  * APIs `Network.HTTP2.Priority` are changed again. `Precedence` is introduced.

  ## 1.2.0

  * APIs of `Network.HTTP2.Priority` are changed. `delete` is provided. Internal data structure is changed from random skew heap to priority search queue.
