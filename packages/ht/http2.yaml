changelog: |
  ## 4.1.0

  * Implementing streaming from the client side.
    [#41](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/41)
  * Making use of SettingsMaxFrameSize
    [#44](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/44)
    [#57](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/57)
  * Disabling flow control
    [#55](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/55)
  * Fixing buffer overrun by trailers
    [#52](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/52)
  * Proper use of settings
  * Breaking change: the data structure of `Next` was changed.
    The `http3` package is influenced.

  ## 4.0.0

  * Breaking change: `HTTP2Error` is redefined.
  * Breaking change: `FrameTypeId`, `SettingsKeyId` and `ErrorCodeId` are removed.
    Use `FrameType`, `SettingsKey` and `ErrorCode` instead.
  * A client can receive a concrete `HTTP2Error`.
  * Catching up RFC 9113. Host: and :authority cannot disagree.
  * Breaking change: `Network.HTTP2` and `Network.HTTP2.Priority` are removed.
  * Breaking change: obsoleted stuff are removed.

  ## 3.0.3

  * Return correct status messages in HTTP2 client
    [#31](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/31)
  * Follow changes in Aeson 2
    [#32](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/32)
  * Make sure connection preface is always sent first
    [#33](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/33)
  * Avoid empty data
    [#34](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/34)

  ## 3.0.2

  * Skip inserting entries that do not fit in the encoding table
    [#28](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/28)

  ## 3.0.1

  * Including a necessary file for testing.

  ## 3.0.0

  * DOS preventions.
  * Providing Network.HTTP.Client.
  * `Internal` modules are exported.
  * Dropping the priority feature from Network.HTTP.Server.
  * `Network.HTTP2.Priority` is deprecated.
  * `Network.HTTP2` module is deprecated. Use `Network.HTTP2.Frame` instead.
  * Adding some tokens.

  ## 2.0.6

  * Dropping support of GHC 7.x

  ## 2.0.5

  * Passing the correct request

  ## 2.0.4

  * Freeing dynamic tables.

  ## 2.0.3

  * Using shutdown instead of close in the example. This is important to
    send GOAWAY properly.

  ## 2.0.2

  * Bug fix of flush limit.

  ## 2.0.1

  * Bug fix for defaultReadN.
  * Providing allocSimpleConfig and freeSimpleConfig.
  * Deprecating makeSimpleConfig.

  ## 2.0.0

  * Providing Network.HTTP.Server.

  ## 1.6.5

  * Deny shrink of dynamic table to zero size
    [#17](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/17)

  ## 1.6.4

  * checkFrameHeader for FrameHeaders.
    [#15](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/15)

  ## 1.6.3

  * Fixing two bugs of HPACK pointed out by h2spec v2.

  ## 1.6.2

  * Improving the performance of HPACK.
  * Huffman encoding is now based on H2O's one.

  ## 1.6.1

  * Improving the performance of HPACK.

  ## 1.6.0

  * Reverse indices of HPACK are now based on tokens.
  * New APIs: encodeTokenHeader and decodeTokenHeader.
  * Deleted API: encodeHeaderBuffer -- use encodeTokenHeader instead.
  * New module: Network.HPACK.Token

  ## 1.5.4

  * Fixing a bug due to misuse of memcpy(). (#8)

  ## 1.5.3

  * Adding debug information.

  ## 1.5.2

  * Minor optimization for HPACK.

  ## 1.5.1

  * Adding a missing file for testing.

  ## 1.5.0

  * New API for HPACK. HPACK is much faster than 1.4.x (roughly x3.2).
    The default encoding is now Linear instead of LinearH.

  ## 1.4.5

  * Removing zero reset from priority queues.

  ## 1.4.4

  * Fixing a bug of reverse index.

  ## 1.4.3

  * Priority benchmark is now external information versions.
  * Using proper baseDeficit for deletion.

  ## 1.4.2

  * Test files are now self-contained.

  ## 1.4.1

  * The reverse indices for static and dynamic are combined for performance.

  ## 1.4.0

  * Providing dequeueSTM, isEmpty and isEmptySTM. Users can compose
    their own control queue with dequeueSTM and isEmptySTM.

  * Removing enqueueControl: it appeared that PriorityTree is not
    suitable for control frames. ã€€For example, the dependency of all
    control frames is stream 0.  So, PSQ does not contain multiple
    control frames at the same time.  We removed enqueueControl. Users
    should prepare a queue for control frames by themselves.

  ## 1.3.1

  * Defining IllegalTableSizeUpdate.

  ## 1.3.0

  * APIs `Network.HTTP2.Priority` are changed again. `Precedence` is introduced.

  ## 1.2.0

  * APIs of `Network.HTTP2.Priority` are changed. `delete` is provided. Internal data structure is changed from random skew heap to priority search queue.
