  Changelog
  =========

  - [Version 0.8.0.0](https://github.com/zmthy/http-media/releases/tag/v0.8.0.0)

    Removed official support for GHC 7.8.

    A separate `QualityOrder` type can now be extracted from a `Quality`
    value for performing comparisons without the attached data value.

    The most specific match will now be used to assign a quality value to
    each server option, ensuring that less specific matches cannot
    override lower quality values on more specific matches. In particular,
    if a type is considered unacceptable by the client, then a separate
    match with a non-zero quality value cannot make it acceptable.

    Numeric characters are now permitted in the tail of a Language value.

    Added support for Accept-Encoding and Content-Encoding.

    Added support for Accept-Charset and Content-Charset.

    The bounds for QuickCheck have been updated to include the latest
    version.

  - [Version 0.7.1.3](https://github.com/zmthy/http-media/releases/tag/v0.7.1.3)

    Package bounds have been updated for GHC 8.6.

  - [Version 0.7.1.2](https://github.com/zmthy/http-media/releases/tag/v0.7.1.2)

    The bounds for QuickCheck have been updated to include the latest
    version.

  - [Version 0.7.1.1](https://github.com/zmthy/http-media/releases/tag/v0.7.1.1)

    The bounds for base have been updated to include support for GHC 8.2.

  - [Version 0.7.1](https://github.com/zmthy/http-media/releases/tag/v0.7.1)

    Travis now tests against a range of Stackage LTS environments, instead
    of using multi-ghc.

    Support for base-4.6 has now been correctly removed in the Cabal file.

  - [Version 0.7.0](https://github.com/zmthy/http-media/releases/tag/v0.7.0)

    The Travis configuration has dropped support for GHC 7.6 and added
    support for 8.0.

    More direct constructors for quality values are now available, to
    avoid having to deal with `Maybe` results when you are certain parsing
    a quality string will not fail.

    The bounds for QuickCheck have been updated to include the latest
    version.

  - [Version 0.6.4](https://github.com/zmthy/http-media/releases/tag/v0.6.4)

    The bounds for QuickCheck have been updated to include the latest
    version.

  - [Version 0.6.3](https://github.com/zmthy/http-media/releases/tag/v0.6.3)

    Parse failures more regularly return a `Maybe` value instead of
    raising an exception.

    The `(//)` smart constructor now accepts wildcard arguments, but only
    in the correct order.

    Most tests will now emit a counter example if their relevant
    properties are violated.  Some tests which were not correctly covering
    their properties have been fixed.

    The `-Werror` flag has been removed from the test suite.

  - [Version 0.6.2](https://github.com/zmthy/http-media/releases/tag/v0.6.2)

    The test suite now uses the test-framework library instead of
    cabal-test-quickcheck, and the package no longer depends on Cabal.

  - [Version 0.6.1](https://github.com/zmthy/http-media/releases/tag/v0.6.1)

    The type errors and build warnings caused by the BBP have been fixed
    for GHC 7.10.

  - [Version 0.6.0](https://github.com/zmthy/http-media/releases/tag/v0.6.0)

    All of the publicly exposed data types now derive an `Ord` instance.

description: |-
  This library is intended to be a comprehensive solution to parsing and
  selecting quality-indexed values in HTTP headers.  It is capable of
  parsing both media types and language parameters from the Accept and
  Content header families, and can be extended to match against other
  accept headers as well.  Selecting the appropriate header value is
  achieved by comparing a list of server options against the
  quality-indexed values supplied by the client.

  In the following example, the Accept header is parsed and then matched
  against a list of server options to serve the appropriate media using
  'mapAcceptMedia':

  > getHeader >>= maybe send406Error sendResourceWith . mapAcceptMedia
  >     [ ("text/html",        asHtml)
  >     , ("application/json", asJson)
  >     ]

  Similarly, the Content-Type header can be used to produce a parser for
  request bodies based on the given content type with 'mapContentMedia':

  > getContentType >>= maybe send415Error readRequestBodyWith . mapContentMedia
  >     [ ("application/json", parseJson)
  >     , ("text/plain",       parseText)
  >     ]

  The API is agnostic to your choice of server.
