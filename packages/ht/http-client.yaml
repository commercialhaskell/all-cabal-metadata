description: ! "http-client\n===========\n\nFull tutorial docs are available at:\nhttps://haskell-lang.org/library/http-client\n\nAn
  HTTP client engine, intended as a base layer for more user-friendly packages.\n\nThis
  codebase has been refactored from [http-conduit](http://www.stackage.org/package/http-conduit).\n\nNote
  that, if you want to make HTTPS secure connections, you should use\n[http-client-tls](https://www.stackage.org/package/http-client-tls)
  in addition\nto this library.\n\nBelow is a series of cookbook recipes. A number
  of recipes exist elsewhere,\nincluding `Network.HTTP.Client` and `Network.HTTP.Conduit`.
  The goal is to\nexpand this list over time.\n\n## Proxy environment variable\n\nUse
  the following approach to get proxy settings from the `http_proxy` and\n`https_proxy`
  environment variables.\n\n```haskell\n{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}\nimport
  Network.HTTP.Client\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n    let settings = managerSetProxy\n
  \           (proxyEnvironment Nothing)\n            defaultManagerSettings\n    man
  <- newManager settings\n    let req = \"http://httpbin.org\"\n            -- Note
  that the following settings will be completely ignored.\n            { proxy = Just
  $ Proxy \"localhost\" 1234\n            }\n    httpLbs req man >>= print\n```\n"
