  # http-client-overrides

  A library for applying overrides to [`ManagerSettings`][manager-settings]
  when using the [`http-client`][http-client] Haskell library.

  ## Usage

  You probably have some `IO` do notation hidden somewhere which looks like this:

  ```haskell
  manager <- newManager tlsManagerSettings
  ```

  Replace it with this:

  ```haskell
  settings <- withHttpClientOverridesThrow tlsManagerSettings
  manager  <- newManager settings
  ```

  Set the `HTTP_CLIENT_OVERRIDES` environment variable to the location of your
  configuration file. When this environment variable is not set there is no
  additional overhead for HTTP requests as the `ManagerSettings` will not be
  modified. Refer to the [example](./example/) directory for a sample Haskell
  program and configuration file.

  ## Features

  ### Log HTTP requests and responses

  The following fields can be used to print log messages for all HTTP responses,
  requests and request overrides:

  ```yaml
  version: v1
  logOptions:
    responses: simple
    requests: simple
    requestOverrides: simple
  ```

  The currently supported log formats are `simple` and `detailed`. Sample output
  for the `simple` log format is shown below:

  ```
  Overriding request: https://unreachable.domain/ -> https://github.com/
  Request: GET https://github.com/ HTTP/1.1
  Response: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  ```

  ### Override HTTP requests

  Match HTTP requests corresponding to a match URL and transform the request
  according to an override URL:

  ```yaml
  version: v1
  requestOverrides:
  - match: unreachable.domain
    override: github.com
  ```

  #### Match semantics

  Matches the first HTTP request which:
  - has the same scheme, host and port as the match URL
  - has a path which is a suffix of the path in the match URL

  Any URL segments ommitted from the match URL are not required for matching.

  #### Override semantics

  Overrides an HTTP request with:
  - the scheme, host and port specified in the override URL
  - replaces the prefix of a matched path with the path in the override URL

  Any URL segments ommitted from the override URL will not be applied to the HTTP
  request.

  #### Examples

  Override all HTTP requests on port 80 to use HTTPS on port 443 (note: the port
  is never automatically interpreted from the scheme):

  ```yaml
  version: v1
  requestOverrides:
  - match: http://:80
    override: https://:443
  ```

  Override all requests to the host `github.com` which have a path prefix of
  `/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/` to use a path prefix of
  `/robbiemcmichael/dhall-lang/` instead.

  ```yaml
  version: v1
  requestOverrides:
  - match: https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/
    override: https://github.com/robbiemcmichael/dhall-lang/
  ```

  #### Debugging

  Set `logOptions.requestOverrides` to `detailed` to see how the URLs have been
  parsed and how any matched HTTP requests are being overridden.
