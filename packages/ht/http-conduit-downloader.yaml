description: |-
  HTTP/HTTPS downloader built on top of @http-client@
  and used in <https://bazqux.com> crawler.

  Previously it was based on @http-conduit@ (hence the name) but since
  all the necessary parts are in @http-client@ now @http-conduit@ is no
  longer used.

  * Handles all possible http-client exceptions and returns
  human readable error messages.

  * Handles some web server bugs (returning 'deflate' data instead of 'gzip',
  invalid 'gzip' encoding).

  * Uses OpenSSL instead of 'tls' package (since 'tls' doesn't handle all sites and works slower than OpenSSL).

  * Ignores invalid SSL sertificates.

  * Receives data in 32k chunks internally to reduce memory fragmentation
  on many parallel downloads.

  * Download timeout.

  * Total download size limit.

  * Returns HTTP headers for subsequent redownloads and handles
  'Not modified' results.

  * Can be used with external DNS resolver (e.g. @concurrent-dns-cache@).
