synopsis: The Haskell Test Framework
changelog: |
  * 0.15.0.0
    - Remove macros for assertions, location information is now provided
      via HasCallStack. For most users, this change should be backwards compatible.
      However, if you imported Test.Framework qualified, then all assert macros
      where previously in scope unqualified, through macros. In this case, you need to
      import Test.Framework unqualified or qualify all uses of assert macros.
    - The modules Test.Framework.CmdlineOptions, Test.Framework.Colors,
      and Test.Framework.TestReporter are no longer exposed. I don't think that
      anyone depends on these internal modules. Let me know I am wrong.

      machine-readable output in a simple JSON-based format
    - support for subAssert (allows abstraction over assertions but keeps error locations)
    - don't depend on unix under Windows
    - added timing information to the output

    - several bugfixes, especially related to location information in presence
      of an extra cpp invocation
    - HTF itself now has a test suite
    - removed upper bounds from .cabal files
    - backwards incompatibilities:
      + Test.Framework now longer exports all of Test.Framework.TestManager and
        Test.Framework.BlackBoxTest. For modules that only define tests, no changes
        should be necessary. However, you likely need to adjust your test runner
        module by importing Test.Framework.TestManager and possibly Test.Framework.BlackBoxTest.
      + Some reorganization in Test.Framework.TestManager and related modules, introduction
        of Test.Framework.TestTypes. Usually, your code should not be affected
        by these changes.

  * 0.9.0.0 (2012-09-26)
    NOTE: this version is NOT backwards compatible with 0.8.*. The documentation on
    hackage describes what you need to do in order to upgrade.

    - Totally reworked how tests are collected
    - Greatly improved documentation (fixes issue #2)
    - Added assertThrowsIO and similar functions (fixes issue #6)
    - Added htfMain function

  * 0.8.2.0 (2012-01-30)
    - Assertions can be run via runTest
    - Support for assertNotEqual
    - Bugfixes

  * 0.8.1.1 (2011-11-07)
    - Bugfixes

  * 0.8.1.0 (2011-11-07)
    - fixed build dependencies to include process 1.1.*

  * 0.8.1.0 (2011-10-01)
    - multi-line diff with pretty-printing
    - bugfixes
    - build support for GHC 7.2.1

  * 0.8.0.0 (2011-09-20)
    - support for `--quiet' option to report failures only
    - color support
    - diff support: if an equality assertions fails, HTF shows a diff of
      the expected and the given value
    - more uniform output
    - tests to execute are now given by a regular expression,
      tests to ignored are prefixed with `--not'

  * 0.7.1.0 (2011-07-08)
    - support for pending tests and quick check properties
    - support for ignoring certain tests in the argument list of
      Test.Framework.TestManager.runTestWithArgs (simply prefix the
      test names with a '-')

  * 0.7.0.1 (2011-05-21)
    - minor fix for the tutorial (thanks to Marnix)

  * 0.7.0.0 (2011-01-25)
    - htfpp parses extension from pragmas
    - runTest, runTestWithArgs, runTestWithFilter return an appropriate exit
      code

  * 0.6.0.1 (2010-12-05)
    - support for GHC 7, QuickCheck 2.3, containers 0.4 and directory 1.1
      (thanks to David Leuschner)

  * 0.6.0.0 (2010-11-12)
    - generalized mtl dependency to accept version 1.1* and 2.0.*.

  * 0.5.0.1 (2010-10-11)
    - preprocessor now parses bang patterns

  * 0.5.0.0 (2010-10-05)
    - added `--hunit' flag to htfpp. (The `--hunit' flag causes assert-like
      macros to be expanded in a way that is backwards-compatible with the
      corresponding functions of the HUnit library.)
    - Some functions in Test.Framework.HUnitWrapper were renamed in a
      non-backwards compatible way. The assert*P functions are now called
      assert*Pretty, and the function assertSetEqual is now called
      assertListsEqualAsSet

  * 0.4.0.0 (2010-09-02)
    - More specific version constraints in .cabal file

  * 0.3.5.0 (2010-08-30)
    - Testable instance for lists

  * 0.3.4.0 (2010-08-30)
    - htfpp now accepts code subject to preprocessing with cpp

  ## Summary

  The Haskell Test Framework (HTF for short) lets you define and organize unit tests
  (http://hackage.haskell.org/package/HUnit), QuickCheck properties
  (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck), and black box tests in an
  easy and convenient way. HTF uses a custom preprocessor that collects
  test definitions automatically.

  HTF produces highly readable output
  for failing test cases: it provides exact file name and line number
  information,
  it colors and pretty prints expected and
  actual results, and it displays a diff highlighting the mismatching parts.

  ## Getting started

  * Read the [tutorial](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/HTF/latest/doc/html/Test-Framework-Tutorial.html).
  * Experiment with the sample project located in the `sample` directory of HTF's source tree.
