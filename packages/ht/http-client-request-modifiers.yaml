description: |
  This package contains simple, monadic functions that modify an HTTP `Request`
  from `http-client`. They make it easy to chain request updates and allow for
  arbitrary monadic effects.

  There are certainly useful functions that are currently not provided. Please
  create an issue or a pull request if you have suggestions.
