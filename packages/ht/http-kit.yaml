description: |-
  A low-level HTTP library that can be used to build more
  sophisticated applications on top of it.

  The design goals are:

  [secure] To mitigate denial-of-service attacks, everything is
  bounded.

  [efficient] Message bodies are read in chunks, so that they
  can be processed in constant space.

  [universal] No framework for streaming @IO@ is used.  This
  allows you to build on top of it, using the libraries that
  fit your purpose.
