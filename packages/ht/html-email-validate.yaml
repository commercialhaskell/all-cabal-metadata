  The library allows to validate and parse an email address
  as it's defined in <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#valid-e-mail-address HTML standard>.
  Note that HTML specification of a valid email address is a
  'willful violation' of RFC 5322. If you want to validate
  an address against RFC 5322 you should use <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/email-validate email-validate>.
