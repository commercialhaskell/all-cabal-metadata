description: |-
  HTestU is a library for testing correctness of presudo random number generators (PRNGs) written in Haskell.
  HTestU uses a library TestU01 based on a paper "TestU01: A C Library for Empirical Testing of Random Number Generators" by P. L'Ecuyer and R. Simard.
  Basically HTestU performs a wrapping of a member of the RandomGen typeclass (any reasonable PRNG can be made a member of it) and
  feeds a wrapped generator into a C library which calls the wrapped generator to fill the buffer with pseudo random numbers and then
  perform tests on the generated numbers.
  HTestU offers three batteries: smallCrush, crush and bigCrush (as they were specified in TestU01 paper) and a number of
  streaming functions which allow one to wrap the PRNG differently for the purpose of testing different patterns of PRNG usage.
