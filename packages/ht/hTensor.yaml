description: |-
  This is an experimental library for multidimensional arrays,
  oriented to support simple tensor computations and multilinear
  algebra.

  Array dimensions have an \"identity\" which is preserved
  in data manipulation. Indices are explicitly selected by name in
  expressions, and Einstein's summation convention for repeated indices
  is automatically applied.

  The library has a purely functional interface: arrays are immutable,
  and operations typically work on whole structures which can be assembled
  and decomposed using simple primitives. Arguments are automatically made conformant
  by replicating them along extra dimensions appearing in an operation.
  There is preliminary support for Geometric Algebra and for solving multilinear systems.

  A tutorial can be found in the website of the project.
