description: ! 'Addition to the http-client and http-client-tls

  libraries, that restricts the HTTP servers that can be used.


  This is useful when a security policy needs to eg, prevent connections to

  HTTP servers on localhost or a local network, or only allow connections

  to a specific HTTP server.


  It handles restricting redirects as well as the initial HTTP connection,

  and it also guards against DNS poisoning attacks.'
