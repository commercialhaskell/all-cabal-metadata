description: |-
  Addition to the http-client and http-client-tls
  libraries, that restricts the HTTP servers that can be used.

  This is useful when a security policy needs to eg, prevent connections to
  HTTP servers on localhost or a local network, or only allow connections
  to a specific HTTP server.

  It handles restricting redirects as well as the initial HTTP connection,
  and it also guards against DNS poisoning attacks.
