  Http client with time-limited brRead
  ====================================

  [![Build Status](https://github.com/lyokha/http-client-brread-timeout/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lyokha/http-client-brread-timeout/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)
  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/http-client-brread-timeout.svg?label=hackage%20%7C%20http-client-brread-timeout&logo=haskell&logoColor=%239580D1)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-client-brread-timeout)

  Http client with timeouts applied in between body read events.

  Note that the response timeout in
  [*http-client*](https://github.com/snoyberg/http-client) is applied only when
  receiving the response headers which is not always satisfactory given that a
  slow server may send the rest of the response very slowly.

  ### How do I test this?

  A slow server can be emulated in *Nginx* with the following configuration.

  ```nginx
  user                    nobody;
  worker_processes        2;

  events {
      worker_connections  1024;
  }

  http {
      default_type        application/octet-stream;
      sendfile            on;

      server {
          listen          8010;
          server_name     main;

          location /slow {
              echo 1; echo_flush;
              # send extra chunks of the response body once in 20 sec
              echo_sleep 20; echo 2; echo_flush;
              echo_sleep 20; echo 3; echo_flush;
              echo_sleep 20; echo 4;
          }

          location /very/slow {
              echo 1; echo_flush;
              echo_sleep 20; echo 2; echo_flush;
              # chunk 3 is extremely slow (40 sec)
              echo_sleep 40; echo 3; echo_flush;
              echo_sleep 20; echo 4;
          }
      }
  }
  ```

  Here, the first request comes from the standard `httpLbs` which, after timely
  receiving of the first chunk of the response (including headers and the first
  chunk of the body), no longer applies any timeouts and may last as long as the
  response endures: in this case, it lasts 80 seconds and successfully returns.
  In the second request, `httpLbsBrReadWithTimeout` timely receives the first
  chunk of the response too, the second chunk comes in 20 seconds, and finally,
  as the third chunk is going to come in 40 seconds which exceeds the default
  response timeout value (30 seconds), the function throws `ResponseTimeout`
  exception after 50 seconds from the start of the request. In the third request,
  `httpLbsBrReadWithTimeout` returns successfully after 60 seconds because every
  extra chunk of the response was coming every 20 seconds without triggering the
  timeout.
