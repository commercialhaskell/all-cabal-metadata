  http barf\n\nHTTP barf is a dead simple library to make http requests. It provides
  helper functions to use different http methods, it supports \nboth insecure and
  secure connections without having to deal with managers and the requests can be
  trivially modified using a monoidal\ncombinator library. \n\nYou may use it if you
  just have to vomit out a quick script and don't want to deal with all the complexities
  of involving a library \nthat provides more features or more safety guarantees.\n"
