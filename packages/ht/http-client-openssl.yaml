changelog: |
  ## 0.3.3

  * Use `hostAddress` from `Request`.

  ## 0.3.2.0

  * http-client-openssl: added reasonable OpenSSL default settings

  ## 0.3.1.0
  * Fix a bug with http-proxy that would cause SNI to be set incorrectly; (would
    use the domain of the proxy, instead of the server we're trying to reach
    _through_ the proxy)

  ## 0.3.0.0

  * Wrap HsOpenSSL specific exceptions into http-clients own `HttpExceptionRequest`. This is a breaking change and might need adjustment with respect to exception handling in user code.
  * More robust handling of unexpectedly closed connections

  ## 0.2.2.0

  * Tell OpenSSL what host is being contacted, so it can use the SNI extension for certificate selection if the server requires it.

  ## 0.2.1.1

  * Fix a connection-bug with http-proxy(Previous version closes a connection before reading all respose-data.)

  ## 0.2.1.0

  * Add support for http-proxy

  ## 0.2.0.5

  * Use different domain name so tests pass

  ## 0.2.0.4

  * Minor doc updates

  ## 0.2.0.3

  * Simplified a test case

  ## 0.2.0.1

  [Expand hints for getAddrInfo. More exception safety.](https://github.com/snoyberg/http-client/pull/91)
