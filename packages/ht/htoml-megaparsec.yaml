  [![Latest version on Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/htoml-megaparsec.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/htoml-megaparsec)
  [![Dependencies of latest version on Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage-deps/v/htoml-megaparsec.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/htoml-megaparsec)

  A [TOML](https://github.com/mojombo/toml) parser library in
  [Haskell](http://haskell-lang.org).

  TOML is the obvious, minimal configuration language by
  [Tom Preston-Werner](https://github.com/mojombo).
  It is an alternative to the [XML](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/),
  [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) and
  [INI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) formats mainly for the purpose of
  configuration files. Many will find that XML and YAML are too heavy for
  the purpose of configuration files prupose while INI is underspecified.
  TOML is to configuration files, like what Markdown is for rich-text.

  This library aims to be compatible with the latest version of the
  [TOML spec](https://github.com/mojombo/toml).
  Compatibility between `htoml` version and TOML (as proven by
  [BurntSushi's language agnostic TOML test suite](https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml-test))
  is as follows:

  * [TOML v0.4.0](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/releases/tag/v0.4.0)
  is implemented by  `htoml >= 1.0.0.0`
  * *(currently only one item in this mapping, more will follow)*


  ### Documentation

  Apart from this README, documentation for this package may
  (or may not) be found on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/htoml).


  ### Quick start

  Installing `htoml` is easy. Either by using
  [Stack](http://haskellstack.org) (recommended):

      stack install htoml

  Or by using Cabal:

      cabal install htoml

  In order to make your project depend on it you can add it as a
  dependency in your project's `.cabal` file, and since it is not
  yet on [Stackage](https://www.stackage.org/) you will also have
  to add it to the `extra-deps` section of your `stack.yaml` file
  when using Stack.

  To quickly show some features of `htoml` we use Stack to start a
  GHCi-based REPL. It picks up configuration from the `.ghci` file
  in the root of the repository.

      git clone https://github.com/cies/htoml.git
      cd htoml
      stack init
      stack --install-ghc ghci

  Add a `--resolver` flag to the `stack init` command to specify
  a specific package snapshot, e.g.: `--resolver lts-4.1`.

  In case you have missing dependencies (possibly `file-embed`),
  they can be added to the `extra-deps` in `stack.yaml`
  automatically with:

      stack solver --update-config

  We can now start exploring `htoml` from a GHCi REPL. From the
  root of this repository run:

      stack ghci

  Now read a `.toml` file from the benchmark suite, with:

  ```haskell
  txt <- readFile "benchmarks/example.toml"
  let r = parseTomlDoc "" txt
  r
  ```

  ...which prints:

      Right (fromList [("database",VTable (fromList [("enabled",VBoolean True),("po [...]

  Then convert it to [Aeson](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson) (JSON), with:

  ```haskell
  let Right toml = r
  toJSON toml
  ```

  ...which prints:

      Object (fromList [("database",Object (fromList [("enabled",Bool True),("po [...]

  Finally trigger a parse error, with:

  ```haskell
  let Left err = parseTomlDoc "" "== invalid toml =="
  err
  ```

  ...it errors out (as it should), showing:

      (line 1, column 1):
      unexpected '='
      expecting "#", "\n", "\r\n", letter or digit, "_", "-", "\"", "'", "[" or end of input

  **Note:** Some of the above outputs are truncated, indicated by `[...]`.


  ### How to pull data from a TOML file after parsing it

  Once you have sucessfully parsed a TOML file you most likely want to pull
  some piecces of data out of the resulting data structure.

  To do so you have two main options. The first is to use pattern matching.
  For example let's consider the following `parseResult`:

  ```haskell
  Right (fromList [("server",VTable (fromList [("enabled",VBoolean True)] ) )] )
  ```

  Which could be pattern matched with:

  ```haskell
  case parseResult of
    Left  _ -> "Could not parse file"
    Right m -> case m ! "server" of
      VTable mm -> case mm ! "enabled" of
        VBoolean b -> "Server is " ++ (if b then "enabled" else "disabled")
        _ -> "Could not parse server status (Boolean)"
      _ -> "TOML file does not contain the 'server' key"
  ```

  The second main option is to use the `toJSON` function to transform the data
  to an [Aeson](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson) data structure,
  after which you can use your Aeson toolbelt to tackle the problem. Since
  TOML is intended to be a close cousin of JSON this is a very practical
  approach.

  Other ways to pull data from a parsed TOML document will most likely
  exist; possible using the `lens` library as
  [documented here](https://github.com/cies/htoml/issues/8).


  ### Compatibility

  Currently we are testing against several versions of GHC with
  [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/cies/htoml) as defined in the `env` section of our
  [`.travis.yml`](https://github.com/cies/htoml/blob/master/.travis.yml).
  `lts-2` implies GHC 7.8.4, `lts-3` implies GHC 7.10.2, `lts-4`/`lts-5`
  imply GHC 7.10.3, and `nightly` is build with a regularly updated version of GHC.


  ### Version contraints of `htoml`'s dependencies

  If you encounter any problems because `htoml`'s dependecies are
  constrained either too much or too little, please
  [file a issue](https://github.com/cies/htoml/issues) for that.
  Or off even better submit a PR.


  ### Tests and benchmarks

  Tests are build and run with:

      stack test

  [BurntSushi's language agnostic test suite](https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml-test)
  is embedded in the test suite executable.  Using a shell script (that
  lives in `test/BurntSushi`) the latest tests can be fetched from
  its Github repository.

  The benchmarks, that use the amazing [`criterion`](http://www.serpentine.com/criterion)
  library, are build and run with:

      stack build :benchmarks


  ### Contributions

  Most welcome! Please raise issues, start discussions, give comments or
  submit pull-requests.
  This is one of the first Haskell libraries I wrote, feedback is
  much appreciated.


  ### Features

  * Compatibility to the TOML spec is proven by an extensive test suite
  * Incorporates [BurntSushi's language agnostic test suite](https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml-test)
  * Has an internal representation that easily maps to JSON
  * Provides an [Aeson](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson)-style JSON interface (suggested by Greg Weber)
  * Useful error messages (thanks to using Parsec over Attoparsec)
  * Understands arrays as described in [this issue](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/254)
  * Fails on mix-type arrays (as per spec)
  * Comes with a benchmark suite to make performance gains/regressions measurable
  * Tries to be well documented (please raise an issue if you find documentation lacking)
  * Available on [Stackage](http://stackage.org) (see top of this README for badges
    indicating TOMLs *inclusion in Stackage status*)


  ### Todo

  * More documentation and start to use the proper Haddock idioms
  * Add property tests with QuickCheck (the internet says it's possible for parsers)
  * Extensively test error cases (probably improving error reporting along the way)
  * See how lenses may (or may not) fit into this package, or an additional package
  * Consider moving to [one of the more modern parser combinators](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/46u45o/what_is_the_current_state_of_parser_libraries_in)
    in Haskell (`megaparsec` maybe?) -- possibly wait until a clear winner shows

  Do you see todo that looks like fun thing to implement and you can spare the time?
  Please knoe that PRs are welcome :)


  ### Acknowledgements

  Originally this project started off by improving the `toml` package by
  Spiros Eliopoulos.

  [HuwCampbell](https://github.com/HuwCampbell) helped a lot by making tests
  pass and implementing "explicitness tracking" in Parsec's parser state.
