changelog: "# Revision history for phladiprelio-ukrainian-simple\n\n## 0.1.0.0 --
  2023-03-12\n\n* First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n## 0.1.0.1
  -- 2023-03-12\n\n* First version revised A. Some documentation improvements.\n\n##
  0.1.0.2 -- 2023-03-12\n\n* First version revised B. Some documentation improvements.\n\n##
  0.1.1.0 -- 2023-03-12\n\n* First version revised C. Switched to another version
  of rhythmic-sequences package that changes\n  the behaviour.\n\n## 0.1.2.0 -- 2023-03-12\n\n*
  First version revised D. Added documentation and video examples of usage. See the
  README.md.\n\n## 0.2.0.0 -- 2023-03-17\n\n* Second version. Added help message (phladiprelioUkr
  -h). Changed the +h argument group to +c\n  argument group. Updated the dependency
  boundaries.\n\n## 0.3.0.0 -- 2023-03-19\n\n* Third version. Added new possibilities
  for reverse order and a new test for 'smoothness'\nof the line. The latter one works
  for most cases because of the highly not equal pairwise \nvalues for the syllable
  durations.\n\n## 0.3.0.1 -- 2023-03-19\n\n* Third version revised A. Some minor
  code improvements.\n\n## 0.3.1.0 -- 2023-03-27\n\n* Third version revised B. Added
  the \"-t 2\" command line options with weaker and permissive\ntest for irregularities
  that influences prosody.\n\n## 0.3.2.0 -- 2023-03-29\n\n* Third version revised
  C. Added the possibility to specify custom hash step. Added the possibility\nto
  run test for average values - with \"-t 3\" command line options that can give more
  information\non potentially irregular or unstable line options. Updated the dependency
  boundaries of \nrhythmic-sequences.\n\n## 0.3.3.0 -- 2023-04-04\n\n* Third version
  revised D. Added the possibility to see example lines for minimum and maximum values\n
  \ for the properties in the test mode using the \"-t <one of 4, 5, or 6>\" command
  line arguments.\n\n## 0.3.4.0 -- 2023-04-17\n\n* Third version revised E. Added
  the possibility to see example lines for minimum and maximum values\nfor the properties
  in  the test mode using the \"-t <one of 7, 8, or 9>\" command line arguments.\n\n##
  0.4.0.0 -- 2023-05-13\n\n* Fourth version. Added two new command line groups of
  arguments - \"-p\" (no Ukrainian minimal grammar\nrules application) and \"+a ...
  -a\" (constraints). Updated documentation (especially new pdfs). \nAdded new lightweight
  dependencies. \n\n## 0.5.0.0 -- 2023-05-25\n\n* Fifth version. Added two new command
  line groups of arguments - \"+l\" (add empty line to output for \nnot test option)
  and +b ... -b with the extended group of constraints handling. Extended the \nset
  of constraints with new ones and now  there are 12 types of them. Some documentation\nimprovements.
  Fixed issues with the numbering in the constraints. \nUpdated the documentation
  and dependencies boundaries. \n\n## 0.5.0.1 -- 2023-05-25\n\n* Fifth version revised
  A. Fixed issue with inaccurate help message. \n\n## 0.5.1.0 -- 2023-05-25\n\n* Fifth
  version revised B. Fixed issues with operator precedence (&&) and (||). Now should
  behave \nas defined in Haskell itself (as usual). \n\n## 0.5.1.1 -- 2023-05-25\n\n*
  Fifth version revised C. Fixed minor inaccuracy in the README.md file. \n\n## 0.5.2.0
  -- 2023-06-01\n\n* Fifth version revised D. Updated the dependency boundaries so
  that to include the fixes for them.\nSome documentation update. This is an intermediate
  release mostly for testing. \n\n## 0.5.3.0 -- 2023-06-01\n\n* Fifth version revised
  E. Fixed issue with incorrect work with spaces inside the +b ... -b\n  algebraic
  constraints arguments. The parentheses usage inside the +b ... -b is still not working\n--
  it is a known issue to be fixed in the further releases. It is also an intermediate
  release \nfor testing.\n\n## 0.6.0.0 -- 2023-06-02\n\n* Sixth version. Fixed issues
  with the incorrect work of the parentheses inside the +b ... -b \ncommand line arguments
  group. Added much more tests to -t parameters. Some performance improvements. Updated
  the\ndocumentation of the help menu and general documentation. Updated the dependecy
  boundaries for the\nnew version of phonetic-languages-constraints-array to fix functionality.\n\n##
  0.7.0.0 -- 2023-06-15\n\n* Seventh version. Fixed some issues with tests output
  for all platforms and issues with output for\n  Windows users for non-tests functionality.
  Added new constraint of U. Updated the documentation.\nAdded two new command line
  options - +w and +f which allows to specify the output mode for \nprinting in the
  terminal window and printing the result to the file. Added new dependencies. \nSwitched
  to the two-column ouput as a usual one for non-tests functionality. For more information,\nsee
  phladiprelioUkr -h and / or README.md.\n\n## 0.8.0.0 -- 2023-06-23\n\n* Eigth version.
  Splitted executable code into executable and library code. Updated dependencies.\nFixed
  some issues with printing the resulting information. Some documentation improvements.\n\n##
  0.8.1.0 -- 2023-06-24\n\n* Eigth version revised A. Switched to the updated version
  of dependencies so that it can be built\non the GHC-9.6.* series of compiler.\n\n##
  0.9.0.0 -- 2023-07-30\n\n* Ninth version. Added asynchronous concurrent calculations
  and async as a package dependency. Added\n  the possibility to calculate for the
  text with maximum 9 words or their combinations (using +x\ncommand line option).
  Added new draft papers with improved theory about the usage of the software.\n\n"
