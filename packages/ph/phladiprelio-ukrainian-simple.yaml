  meter to print additional information about\npoints of incongruences of the line
  for +f group of command line arguments (using +f <filename for saving> <code> where
  code is in the range of (10..19) inclusively). \nAdded the possibility to work with
  multiline files as the input of the program on the per line basis using +m group\ncommand
  line arguments. Moved the shared with phladiprelio-general-simple code to the new
  package \nphladiprelio-tests to reduce code duplication. Updated the dependencies.\n\n##
  0.11.0.0 -- 2023-10-01\n\n* Eleventh version. Added the \"music\" mode of processment
  that allows to create better lyrics and\n  music. Some documentation improvements.
  Updated the dependencies. Now the text does not filter out the\nunderscores and
  digits. Nevertheless, they are treated only in the music mode as really meaningful\nsymbols,
  otherwise, they are treated as spaces.\n\n## 0.11.0.1 -- 2023-10-01\n\n* Eleventh
  version revised A. Fixed issue with documentation for README.md file.\n\n## 0.12.0.0

  -- 2023-11-17\n\n* Fourteenth version. Added a possibility to change the durations
  of the selected syllables\nusing the ={set of digits} precisely after the needed
  syllable. For more information, see the output\nof the call of the program with
  the -h command line argument. This significantly extends the general\npossibilities
  of the program, especially for the music composing.\n\n## 0.14.1.0 -- 2023-11-23\n\n*
  Fourteenth version revised A. Fixed issues with incorrectly computed arguments.\n\n##

  the version 0.7.0.0 the default mode for non-tests output is in two-column. This
  improves \nthe UI / UX for the end user. Besides there is the possibility to write
  the result to a file.\n\nThe video with the demonstration of the new functionality
  in the version 0.7.0.0 is by the link:\n\n[new functionality in 0.7.0.0](https://www.facebook.com/100012184148486/posts/1767318773684244)\n\nThree

  by the link:\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zapAPpQ-fc4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zapAPpQ-fc4)\n\nSince
  the version 0.13.0.0 there is a possibility to compare the distances (opposite to
  the\nsimilarity measure) for the line options using the +l2 ... -l2 command line
  group of options. It is\ngenerally a completely new functionality for the package.\n\nSince
  the version 0.14.0.0 there is a possibility to change the durations of the selected
  syllables\nusing the ={set of digits} precisely after the needed syllable. For more
  information, see the output\nof the call of the program with the -h command line
  argument. This significantly extends the general\npossibilities of the program,
  especially for the music composing.\n\nSince the version 0.15.0.0 there were fixed
  issues with distance between line options in several branches and added a possibility
  to analyse and compare two lines from the same file using either additionally to
  +m also +m2 group of command line arguments, or +m3 group of arguments instead.\n\nTo
  see the help message with synopsis information, run:\n\nphladiprelioUkr -h\n\nSince
  the version 0.15.1.0 there is a possibility to see selective help just for one command
  line option (e. g. +dc) with general context or without it. To get the help message
  for the option with general context (extended help for one command line argument),
  use combination of \"-h <full first command line argument in the command line option
  signing>\" (e. g. -h +dc). To get just help on this option without context, use
  the option without \"+\" or \"-\" (e. g. \"-h dc\").\n\nThe version 0.15.3.0 adds
  some performance improvements and fixes the issue with just one syllable before
  '=' symbol in music mode.\n\nFor the list of bash aliases a few of which are used
  in the videos, see:\nhttps://github.com/Oleksandr-Zhabenko/phladiprelio-alias/blob/main/.bashrc\n\n
