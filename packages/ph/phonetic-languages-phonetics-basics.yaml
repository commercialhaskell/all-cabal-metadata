  * Third version revised A. Changed some data types and type synonyms in the module Data.Phonetic.Languages.Syllables.
  Some code optimizations in it. Some documentation improvements. Added new auxiliary functions to the module.

  * Third version revised D. Changed the data types representation in the Data.Phonetic.Languages.Syllables module. Used some
  special function refactoring to the algebraic data type to represent a complex predicate of the special structure. Some code
  improvements.

  ## 0.4.0.0 -- 2021-04-28

  * Fourth version. Added a new module Numeric.Wrapper.R.GLPK.Phonetic.Languages.Durations to find out the approximations of
  the phonetic languages representation element durations. For this added two new lightweight dependencies of lists-flines
  and foldable-ix.

  ## 0.5.0.0 -- 2021-04-29

  * Fifth version. Added two new modules Data.Phonetic.Languages.SpecificationsRead and Main. Added an executable pldPL (anologue
  of the pldUkr from r-glpk-phonetic-languages-ukrainian-durations package).

  ## 0.5.1.0 -- 2021-04-30

  * Fifth version revised A. Added two example files with data syntaxis, first of all useful for the pldPL executable. See README.md.
  Added also README.md file with a brief description of the possible scenario of the usage for pldPL. Some code improvements.

  ## 0.6.0.0 -- 2021-05-03

  * Sixth version. Added a module Data.Phonetic.Languages.PrepareText. Added a file EnglishConcatenated.txt that contains additional
  list of the English words the corresponding translations of which are intended to be concatenated to the next phonetic language
  words to preserve the basic grammar. Some code and documentation improvements.

  ## 0.6.0.1 -- 2021-05-04

  * Sixth version revised A. Extended the data in the EnglishConcatenated.txt file. Fixed some issues with the README.md file.

  ## 0.6.1.0 -- 2021-05-07

  * Sixth version revised B. Fixed issues with wrong order of the concatenations in the Data.Phonetic.Languages.PrepareText
  functions. Added some new functions for this.

  ## 0.6.2.0 -- 2021-05-10

  * Sixth version revised C. Some documentation improvements. Fixed issues with being not compiled because of 2 doc-style comments
  (thanks to: Jonathan Ringer at notifications@github.com).

  ## 0.6.3.0 -- 2021-05-19

  * Sixth version revised D. Added Read and added / changed Show instances to the data types in the SegmentRulesG data type in the
  Data.Phonetic.Languages.Syllables module.

  ## 0.7.0.0 -- 2021-06-04

  * Seventh version. Introduces breaking changes, so the related code must be revised and probably rewritten.
  The changes are related with the introducing the possibilities to represent also appearance of the sounds
  in the written text being pronounced and the introduction more general concept of phonemes that creates
  syllable instead of simpler vowel notion.
  Removed the module Data.Phonetic.Languages.Undefined as one being not necessary.

  ## 0.8.0.0 -- 2021-07-24

  * Eigth version. Added new functions to the Data.Phonetic.Languages.PrepareText module to 'grow' the phonetic
  languages text. Some code improvements in the module.

  ## 0.8.1.0 -- 2021-07-24

  * Eigth version revised A. Changed the prepareGrowTextN function (and renamed it to prepareGrowTextMN) so that it
  has some additional meaning.

  ## 0.8.2.0 -- 2021-08-30

  * Eigth version revised B. Removed deprecated filtering from the Data.Phonetic.Languages.PrepareText module.

description: "The version 0.7.0.0 introduces breaking changes, so the related code
  must be revised and probably rewritten.\nThe changes are related with the introducing
  the possibilities to represent also appearance of the sounds\nin the written text
  being pronounced and the introduction more general concept of phonemes that creates\nsyllable
  instead of simpler vowel notion.\n\nThe executable pldPL is intended to use the
  functionality of the :\n\n1) R programming language https://www.r-project.org/\n\n2)
  Rglpk library https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rglpk/index.html\n\n3) GNU
  GLPK library https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/glpk.html\n\nFor more information,
  please, see the documentation for them.\n\n* Some examples.\n\nLet in the file words.txt
  you have the (phonetic language) words and their durations in seconds as pairs separated
  with whitespace \nat the lines.\n\nAlso let in the file controlData.txt you have
  control specifications, an example of syntaxis for which is in the file\ncontrolDataExample.txt.\n\nAlso
  let in the file gwrsys.txt you have GWritingSystemPRPLX specifications, an example
  of syntaxis for which is in the\nfile gwrsysExample.txt.\n\nThen the following commands
  can be variants of the usage of the pldPL executable. \n\n1) pldPL 0.001 0.001 0.01
  0.02 words.txt controlData.txt gwrsys.txt 0.3 0.2 0.02 0.06 1.8 -1 0.01 0.01 1.5
  1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 | R --quiet --no-save \n\nThis variant tries to minimize the
  duration of the only one element belonging to the special phonetic language representation\nelements
  (-1 as the second parameter after the file name), tries \nto reduce the influence
  of the two other elements (the third and the fourth parameters as 0.01) and tries
  to somewhat \nmake longer the 6 vowels (all the consonants have by that the default
  coefficients equal to 1.0) (a simple example, though\nthe program supports also
  the more complicated ones).\n\n2) pldPL 0.001 0.001 0.01 0.02 words.txt controlData.txt
  gwrsys.txt 0.3 0.2 0.02 0.06 1.8 -1 0.01 0.01 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 | R --quiet
  --no-save \n\nThe same as the 1), but with more prolongation of the vowels.\n\n3)
  pldPL 0.001 0.001 0.01 0.02 words.txt controlData.txt gwrsys.txt 0.3 0.2 0.02 0.06
  1.4 -1 0.01 0.01 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 | R --quiet --no-save \n\nIf the 2) gives
  you the not NULL result, then it is recommended to minimize the first parameter
  after the next 4 parameters\nafter the gwrsys.txt. \n\n4) pldPL 0.001 0.001 0.01
  0.02 words.txt controlData.txt gwrsys.txt 0.3 0.2 0.02 0.06 1.6 -1 0.01 0.01 2.5
  2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 | R --quiet --no-save \n\nIf the previous gives NULL result,
  then try to somewhat increase the first parameter after the next 4 parameters\nafter
  the gwrsys.txt.\n\nTherefore, using such a binary search for the single parameter
  above, try to find out the more precise value of the point where\nthe pldPL gives
  not NULL result and then use the obtained result as the durations for the system
  of phonetic languages representations.\n\nIt is needed to be said that if omitted,
  the durations coefficients are equal to the default 1.0.\n\nAn example of the pldPL
  functionality already in use is the pldUkr executable of the\nr-glpk-phonetic-languages-ukrainian-durations
  package. For more information, please,\nrefer to: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/r-glpk-phonetic-languages-ukrainian-durations\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn
  the file EnglishConcatenated.txt in the source tarball there are English words the
  translations of which are intended to be\nconcatenated to the next word in the phonetic
  language before applying sound processing so that the basic grammar is preserved.\n"
