description: 'There already exists a Ukrainian implementation for the phonetic languages
  approach published at: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/phonetic-languages-simplified-examples-array.
  It is optimized for the Ukrainian only and needs to be rewritten for every new language
  mostly from scratch using it as a template. To avoid this boilerplate, this one
  is provided. It can be used for different languages and even for music or other
  fields.'
