  ## 0.4.0.0 -- 2021-04-28

  * Fourth version. Added a new module Numeric.Wrapper.R.GLPK.Phonetic.Languages.Durations to find out the approximations of

  ## 0.5.0.0 -- 2021-04-29

  * Fifth version. Added two new modules Data.Phonetic.Languages.SpecificationsRead and Main. Added an executable pldPL (anologue

  * Fifth version revised A. Added two example files with data syntaxis, first of all useful for the pldPL executable. See README.md.
  Added also README.md file with a brief description of the possible scenario of the usage for pldPL. Some code improvements.

  ## 0.6.0.0 -- 2021-05-03

  * Sixth version. Added a module Data.Phonetic.Languages.PrepareText. Added a file EnglishConcatenated.txt that contains additional
  list of the English words the corresponding translations of which are intended to be concatenated to the next phonetic language
  words to preserve the basic grammar. Some code and documentation improvements.

  ## 0.6.0.1 -- 2021-05-04

  * Sixth version revised A. Extended the data in the EnglishConcatenated.txt file. Fixed some issues with the README.md file.

  ## 0.6.1.0 -- 2021-05-07

  functions. Added some new functions for this.

  ## 0.6.2.0 -- 2021-05-10

  * Sixth version revised C. Some documentation improvements. Fixed issues with being not compiled because of 2 doc-style comments
  (thanks to: Jonathan Ringer at notifications@github.com).

  ## 0.6.3.0 -- 2021-05-19

  * Sixth version revised D. Added Read and added / changed Show instances to the data types in the SegmentRulesG data type in the
  Data.Phonetic.Languages.Syllables module.

  ## 0.7.0.0 -- 2021-06-04

  * Seventh version. Introduces breaking changes, so the related code must be revised and probably rewritten.
  The changes are related with the introducing the possibilities to represent also appearance of the sounds
  in the written text being pronounced and the introduction more general concept of phonemes that creates
  syllable instead of simpler vowel notion.
  Removed the module Data.Phonetic.Languages.Undefined as one being not necessary.

  ## 0.8.0.0 -- 2021-07-24

  * Eigth version. Added new functions to the Data.Phonetic.Languages.PrepareText module to 'grow' the phonetic
  languages text. Some code improvements in the module.

  ## 0.8.1.0 -- 2021-07-24

  * Eigth version revised A. Changed the prepareGrowTextN function (and renamed it to prepareGrowTextMN) so that it
  has some additional meaning.

  ## 0.8.2.0 -- 2021-08-30

  * Eigth version revised B. Removed deprecated filtering from the Data.Phonetic.Languages.PrepareText module.

  ## 0.8.3.0 -- 2021-08-31

  * Eigth version revised C. Fixed issue with splitLinesN function.

  ## 0.8.4.0 -- 2021-09-04

  * Eigth version revised D. Added new 'tuned' functions to the Data.Phonetic.Languages.PrepareText module.

  ## 0.9.0.0 -- 2022-02-09

  * Ninth version. Fixed the long existing issues with not working prepending needed concatenations for the text in the
  module Data.Phonetic.Languages.PrepareText. Added also the possibility to not only prepend needed words, but also append.
  This introduces breaking changes, so please, wait for update for all the dependent packages before starting the upgrade, also
  check the code that uses library functions afterwards.

  The version 0.9.0.0 fixed the long existing issues with not working prepending needed concatenations for the text in the
  module Data.Phonetic.Languages.PrepareText. Added also the possibility to not only prepend needed words, but also append.
  This introduces breaking changes, so please, wait for update for all the dependent packages before starting the upgrade, also
  check the code that uses library functions afterwards.

  The version 0.7.0.0 introduces breaking changes, so the related code must be revised and probably rewritten.
  The changes are related with the introducing the possibilities to represent also appearance of the sounds
  in the written text being pronounced and the introduction more general concept of phonemes that creates
  syllable instead of simpler vowel notion.

  The executable pldPL is intended to use the functionality of the :

  1) R programming language https://www.r-project.org/

  2) Rglpk library https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rglpk/index.html

  3) GNU GLPK library https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/glpk.html

  For more information, please, see the documentation for them.

  * Some examples.

  Let in the file words.txt you have the (phonetic language) words and their durations in seconds as pairs separated with whitespace
  at the lines.

  Also let in the file controlData.txt you have control specifications, an example of syntaxis for which is in the file
  controlDataExample.txt.

  Also let in the file gwrsys.txt you have GWritingSystemPRPLX specifications, an example of syntaxis for which is in the
  file gwrsysExample.txt.

  Then the following commands can be variants of the usage of the pldPL executable.

  1) pldPL 0.001 0.001 0.01 0.02 words.txt controlData.txt gwrsys.txt 0.3 0.2 0.02 0.06 1.8 -1 0.01 0.01 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 | R --quiet --no-save

  This variant tries to minimize the duration of the only one element belonging to the special phonetic language representation
  elements (-1 as the second parameter after the file name), tries
  to reduce the influence of the two other elements (the third and the fourth parameters as 0.01) and tries to somewhat
  make longer the 6 vowels (all the consonants have by that the default coefficients equal to 1.0) (a simple example, though
  the program supports also the more complicated ones).

  2) pldPL 0.001 0.001 0.01 0.02 words.txt controlData.txt gwrsys.txt 0.3 0.2 0.02 0.06 1.8 -1 0.01 0.01 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 | R --quiet --no-save

  The same as the 1), but with more prolongation of the vowels.

  3) pldPL 0.001 0.001 0.01 0.02 words.txt controlData.txt gwrsys.txt 0.3 0.2 0.02 0.06 1.4 -1 0.01 0.01 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 | R --quiet --no-save

  If the 2) gives you the not NULL result, then it is recommended to minimize the first parameter after the next 4 parameters
  after the gwrsys.txt.

  4) pldPL 0.001 0.001 0.01 0.02 words.txt controlData.txt gwrsys.txt 0.3 0.2 0.02 0.06 1.6 -1 0.01 0.01 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 | R --quiet --no-save

  If the previous gives NULL result, then try to somewhat increase the first parameter after the next 4 parameters
  after the gwrsys.txt.

  Therefore, using such a binary search for the single parameter above, try to find out the more precise value of the point where
  the pldPL gives not NULL result and then use the obtained result as the durations for the system of phonetic languages representations.

  It is needed to be said that if omitted, the durations coefficients are equal to the default 1.0.

  An example of the pldPL functionality already in use is the pldUkr executable of the
  r-glpk-phonetic-languages-ukrainian-durations package. For more information, please,
  refer to: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/r-glpk-phonetic-languages-ukrainian-durations

  In the file EnglishConcatenated.txt in the source tarball there are English words the translations of which are intended to be
  concatenated to the next word in the phonetic language before applying sound processing so that the basic grammar is preserved.
