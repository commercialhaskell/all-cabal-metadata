  issues with being not compiled because of no Ix instance specified for Array first
  argument. \n\n## 0.3.0.0 -- 2021-04-20\n\n* Third version. Added a new module Data.Phonetic.Languages.Syllables
  for the general syllable segmentation. Added new\nlightweight dependencies of mmsyn5
  and mmsyn2-array.\n\n## 0.3.1.0 -- 2021-04-21\n\n* Third version revised A. Changed
  some data types and type synonyms in the module Data.Phonetic.Languages.Syllables.\nSome

  \n\n## 0.3.4.0 -- 2021-04-26\n\n* Third version revised D. Changed the data types
  representation in the Data.Phonetic.Languages.Syllables module. Used some\nspecial

  Fourth version. Added a new module Numeric.Wrapper.R.GLPK.Phonetic.Languages.Durations
  to find out the approximations of\nthe phonetic languages representation element
  durations. For this added two new lightweight dependencies of lists-flines\nand
  foldable-ix. \n\n## 0.5.0.0 -- 2021-04-29\n\n* Fifth version. Added two new modules
  Data.Phonetic.Languages.SpecificationsRead and Main. Added an executable pldPL (anologue\nof
  the pldUkr from r-glpk-phonetic-languages-ukrainian-durations package). \n\n## 0.5.1.0
  -- 2021-04-30\n\n* Fifth version revised A. Added two example files with data syntaxis,
  first of all useful for the pldPL executable. See README.md.\nAdded also README.md
  file with a brief description of the possible scenario of the usage for pldPL. Some
  code improvements. \n\n## 0.6.0.0 -- 2021-05-03\n\n* Sixth version. Added a module
  Data.Phonetic.Languages.PrepareText. Added a file EnglishConcatenated.txt that contains
  additional\nlist of the English words the corresponding translations of which are
  intended to be concatenated to the next phonetic language\nwords to preserve the
  basic grammar. Some code and documentation improvements. \n\n## 0.6.0.1 -- 2021-05-04\n\n*
  Sixth version revised A. Extended the data in the EnglishConcatenated.txt file.
  Fixed some issues with the README.md file. \n\n## 0.6.1.0 -- 2021-05-07\n\n* Sixth
  version revised B. Fixed issues with wrong order of the concatenations in the Data.Phonetic.Languages.PrepareText\nfunctions.
  Added some new functions for this.\n"

description: "The executable pldPL is intended to use the functionality of the :\n\n1)
  R programming language https://www.r-project.org/\n\n2) Rglpk library https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rglpk/index.html\n\n3)
  GNU GLPK library https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/glpk.html\n\nFor more information,
  please, see the documentation for them.\n\n* Some examples.\n\nLet in the file words.txt
  you have the (phonetic language) words and their durations in seconds as pairs separated
  with whitespace \nat the lines.\n\nAlso let in the file controlData.txt you have
  control specifications, an example of syntaxis for which is in the file\ncontrolDataExample.txt.\n\nAlso
  let in the file gwrsys.txt you have GWritingSystemPRPLX specifications, an example
  of syntaxis for which is in the\nfile gwrsysExample.txt.\n\nThen the following commands
  can be variants of the usage of the pldPL executable. \n\n1) pldPL 0.001 0.001 0.01
  0.02 words.txt controlData.txt gwrsys.txt 0.3 0.2 0.02 0.06 1.8 -1 0.01 0.01 1.5
  1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 | R --quiet --no-save \n\nThis variant tries to minimize the
  duration of the only one element belonging to the special phonetic language representation\nelements
  (-1 as the second parameter after the file name), tries \nto reduce the influence
  of the two other elements (the third and the fourth parameters as 0.01) and tries
  to somewhat \nmake longer the 6 vowels (all the consonants have by that the default
  coefficients equal to 1.0) (a simple example, though\nthe program supports also
  the more complicated ones).\n\n2) pldPL 0.001 0.001 0.01 0.02 words.txt controlData.txt
  gwrsys.txt 0.3 0.2 0.02 0.06 1.8 -1 0.01 0.01 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 | R --quiet
  --no-save \n\nThe same as the 1), but with more prolongation of the vowels.\n\n3)
  pldPL 0.001 0.001 0.01 0.02 words.txt controlData.txt gwrsys.txt 0.3 0.2 0.02 0.06
  1.4 -1 0.01 0.01 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 | R --quiet --no-save \n\nIf the 2) gives
  you the not NULL result, then it is recommended to minimize the first parameter
  after the next 4 parameters\nafter the gwrsys.txt. \n\n4) pldPL 0.001 0.001 0.01
  0.02 words.txt controlData.txt gwrsys.txt 0.3 0.2 0.02 0.06 1.6 -1 0.01 0.01 2.5
  2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 | R --quiet --no-save \n\nIf the previous gives NULL result,
  then try to somewhat increase the first parameter after the next 4 parameters\nafter
  the gwrsys.txt.\n\nTherefore, using such a binary search for the single parameter
  above, try to find out the more precise value of the point where\nthe pldPL gives
  not NULL result and then use the obtained result as the durations for the system
  of phonetic languages representations.\n\nIt is needed to be said that if omitted,
  the durations coefficients are equal to the default 1.0.\n\nAn example of the pldPL
  functionality already in use is the pldUkr executable of the\nr-glpk-phonetic-languages-ukrainian-durations
  package. For more information, please,\nrefer to: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/r-glpk-phonetic-languages-ukrainian-durations\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn
  the file EnglishConcatenated.txt in the source tarball there are English words the
  translations of which are intended to be\nconcatenated to the next word in the phonetic
  language before applying sound processing so that the basic grammar is preserved.\n"
