changelog: "# Revision history for phonetic-languages-phonetics-basics\n\n## 0.1.0.0
  -- 2021-04-19\n\n* First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n## 0.2.0.0
  -- 2021-04-19\n\n* Second version. Added some optimizations for the Data.Phonetic.Languages.Base
  module functions. Added new functions to\nthe module.\n\n## 0.2.1.0 -- 2021-04-20\n\n*
  Second version revised A. Fixed issues with being not compiled for GHC versions
  less than 8.2. \n\n## 0.2.2.0 -- 2021-04-20\n\n* Second version revised B. Fixed
  issues with being not compiled because of no Ix instance specified for Array first
  argument. \n\n## 0.3.0.0 -- 2021-04-20\n\n* Third version. Added a new module Data.Phonetic.Languages.Syllables
  for the general syllable segmentation. Added new\nlightweight dependencies of mmsyn5
  and mmsyn2-array.\n\n## 0.3.1.0 -- 2021-04-21\n\n* Third version revised A. Changed
  some data types and type synonyms in the module Data.Phonetic.Languages.Syllables.\nSome
  code optimizations in it. Some documentation improvements. Added new auxiliary functions
  to the module.\n\n## 0.3.2.0 -- 2021-04-21\n\n* Third version revised B. Fixed issue
  with semantics of the 'divCnsnts' function and related data types. \n\n## 0.3.3.0
  -- 2021-04-24\n\n* Third version revised C. Some code improvements. Added classes
  and instances for classes. Some changes to imrove overall\nrepresentation possibilities.
  \n\n## 0.3.4.0 -- 2021-04-26\n\n* Third version revised D. Changed the data types
  representation in the Data.Phonetic.Languages.Syllables module. Used some\nspecial
  function refactoring to the algebraic data type to represent a complex predicate
  of the special structure. Some code\nimprovements.\n\n## 0.4.0.0 -- 2021-04-28\n\n*
  Fourth version. Added a new module Numeric.Wrapper.R.GLPK.Phonetic.Languages.Durations
  to find out the approximations of\nthe phonetic languages representation element
  durations. For this added two new lightweight dependencies of lists-flines\nand
  foldable-ix. \n"

description: 'There already exists a Ukrainian implementation for the phonetic languages
  approach published at: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/phonetic-languages-simplified-examples-array.
  It is optimized for the Ukrainian only and needs to be rewritten for every new language
  mostly from scratch using it as a template. To avoid this boilerplate, this one
  is provided. It can be used for different languages and even for music or other
  fields.'
