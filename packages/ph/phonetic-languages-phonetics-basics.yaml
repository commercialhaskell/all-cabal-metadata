  special function refactoring to the algebraic data type to represent a complex predicate of the special structure. Some code
  improvements.

  ## 0.4.0.0 -- 2021-04-28

  * Fourth version. Added a new module Numeric.Wrapper.R.GLPK.Phonetic.Languages.Durations to find out the approximations of
  the phonetic languages representation element durations. For this added two new lightweight dependencies of lists-flines
  and foldable-ix.

  ## 0.5.0.0 -- 2021-04-29

  * Fifth version. Added two new modules Data.Phonetic.Languages.SpecificationsRead and Main. Added an executable pldPL (anologue
  of the pldUkr from r-glpk-phonetic-languages-ukrainian-durations package).

  ## 0.5.1.0 -- 2021-04-30

  * Fifth version revised A. Added two example files with data syntaxis, first of all useful for the pldPL executable. See README.md.
  Added also README.md file with a brief description of the possible scenario of the usage for pldPL. Some code improvements.

  ## 0.6.0.0 -- 2021-05-03

  * Sixth version. Added a module Data.Phonetic.Languages.PrepareText. Added a file EnglishConcatenated.txt that contains additional
  list of the English words the corresponding translations of which are intended to be concatenated to the next phonetic language
  words to preserve the basic grammar. Some code and documentation improvements.

  ## 0.6.0.1 -- 2021-05-04

  * Sixth version revised A. Extended the data in the EnglishConcatenated.txt file. Fixed some issues with the README.md file.

  ## 0.6.1.0 -- 2021-05-07

  functions. Added some new functions for this.

  ## 0.6.2.0 -- 2021-05-10

  * Sixth version revised C. Some documentation improvements. Fixed issues with being not compiled because of 2 doc-style comments
  (thanks to: Jonathan Ringer at notifications@github.com).

  ## 0.6.3.0 -- 2021-05-19

  * Sixth version revised D. Added Read and added / changed Show instances to the data types in the SegmentRulesG data type in the
  Data.Phonetic.Languages.Syllables module.

  ## 0.7.0.0 -- 2021-06-04

  * Seventh version. Introduces breaking changes, so the related code must be revised and probably rewritten.
  The changes are related with the introducing the possibilities to represent also appearance of the sounds
  in the written text being pronounced and the introduction more general concept of phonemes that creates
  syllable instead of simpler vowel notion.
  Removed the module Data.Phonetic.Languages.Undefined as one being not necessary.

  ## 0.8.0.0 -- 2021-07-24

  * Eigth version. Added new functions to the Data.Phonetic.Languages.PrepareText module to 'grow' the phonetic
  languages text. Some code improvements in the module.

  ## 0.8.1.0 -- 2021-07-24

  * Eigth version revised A. Changed the prepareGrowTextN function (and renamed it to prepareGrowTextMN) so that it
  has some additional meaning.

  ## 0.8.2.0 -- 2021-08-30

  * Eigth version revised B. Removed deprecated filtering from the Data.Phonetic.Languages.PrepareText module.

  ## 0.8.3.0 -- 2021-08-31

  * Eigth version revised C. Fixed issue with splitLinesN function.

  ## 0.8.4.0 -- 2021-09-04

  * Eigth version revised D. Added new 'tuned' functions to the Data.Phonetic.Languages.PrepareText module.

  ## 0.9.0.0 -- 2022-02-09

  * Ninth version. Fixed the long existing issues with not working prepending needed concatenations for the text in the
  module Data.Phonetic.Languages.PrepareText. Added also the possibility to not only prepend needed words, but also append.
  This introduces breaking changes, so please, wait for update for all the dependent packages before starting the upgrade, also
  check the code that uses library functions afterwards.

  ## 0.9.1.0 -- 2022-09-13

  * Ninth version revised A. Updated the dependencies boundaries. Some minor documentation improvements.

  ## 0.10.0.0 -- 2023-02-03

  * Tenth version. Switched to NoImplicitPrelude extension. Updated the metadata and dependencies boundaries.

  ## 0.10.0.1 -- 2023-02-18

  * Tenth version revised A. Fixed issue with integer conversions that caused build to fail.

  ## 0.10.0.2 -- 2023-02-18

  * Tenth version revised B. Fixed issue with integer conversions that caused build to fail.

  ## 0.10.1.0 -- 2023-09-22

  * Tenth version revised C. Fixed issues with README.md file. Changed the data types inner
    representations where possible to use one less level of redirection for the compiler (experimental
  and not well tested move). Added a devotion to the README.md file.

  ## 0.11.0.0 -- 2024-01-30

  * Eleventh version. Removed deprecated dependencies, switched to more lightweight ones. Some minor code improvements. Added bug-tracker.

description: "The version 0.9.0.0 fixed the long existing issues with not working
  prepending needed concatenations for the text in the\nmodule Data.Phonetic.Languages.PrepareText.
  Added also the possibility to not only prepend needed words, but also append.\nThis
  introduces breaking changes, so please, wait for update for all the dependent packages
  before starting the upgrade, also\ncheck the code that uses library functions afterwards.\n\nThe
  version 0.7.0.0 introduces breaking changes, so the related code must be revised
  and probably rewritten.\nThe changes are related with the introducing the possibilities
  to represent also appearance of the sounds\nin the written text being pronounced
  and the introduction more general concept of phonemes that creates\nsyllable instead
  of simpler vowel notion.\n\nThe executable pldPL is intended to use the functionality
  of the :\n\n1) R programming language https://www.r-project.org/\n\n2) Rglpk library
  https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rglpk/index.html\n\n3) GNU GLPK library
  https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/glpk.html\n\nFor more information, please, see
  the documentation for them.\n\n* Some examples.\n\nLet in the file words.txt you
  have the (phonetic language) words and their durations in seconds as pairs separated
  with whitespace\nat the lines.\n\nAlso let in the file controlData.txt you have
  control specifications, an example of syntaxis for which is in the file\ncontrolDataExample.txt.\n\nAlso
  let in the file gwrsys.txt you have GWritingSystemPRPLX specifications, an example
  of syntaxis for which is in the\nfile gwrsysExample.txt.\n\nIdea of Basic Usage\n===================\n\n*
  You can use the executable in the procedure of minimizing the sets of values in
  the following way.\n\nThe commands below can be variants of the usage of the pldPL
  executable.\n\n1) pldPL 0.001 0.001 0.01 0.02 words.txt controlData.txt gwrsys.txt
  0.3 0.2 0.02 0.06 1.8 -1 0.01 0.01 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 | R --quiet --no-save\n\nThis
  variant tries to minimize the duration of the only one element belonging to the
  special phonetic language representation\nelements (-1 as the sixth parameter after
  the file names), tries\nto reduce the influence of the two other elements (the seventh
  and the eighth parameters as 0.01) and tries to somewhat\nmake longer the 6 vowels
  (all the consonants have by that the default coefficients equal to 1.0) (a simple
  example, though\nthe program supports also the more complicated ones).\n\n2) pldPL
  0.001 0.001 0.01 0.02 words.txt controlData.txt gwrsys.txt 0.3 0.2 0.02 0.06 1.8
  -1 0.01 0.01 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 | R --quiet --no-save\n\nThe same as the 1),
  but with more prolongation of the vowels.\n\n3) pldPL 0.001 0.001 0.01 0.02 words.txt
  controlData.txt gwrsys.txt 0.3 0.2 0.02 0.06 1.4 -1 0.01 0.01 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5
  2.5 | R --quiet --no-save\n\nIf the 2) gives you the not NULL result, then it is
  recommended to minimize the first parameter after the next 4 parameters\nafter the
  gwrsys.txt.\n\n4) pldPL 0.001 0.001 0.01 0.02 words.txt controlData.txt gwrsys.txt
  0.3 0.2 0.02 0.06 1.6 -1 0.01 0.01 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 | R --quiet --no-save\n\nIf
  the previous gives NULL result, then try to somewhat increase the first parameter
  after the next 4 parameters\nafter the gwrsys.txt.\n\nTherefore, using such a binary
  search for the single parameter above, try to find out the more precise value of
  the point where\nthe pldPL gives not NULL result and then use the obtained result
  as the durations for the system of phonetic languages representations.\n\nIt is
  needed to be said that if omitted, the durations coefficients are equal to the default
  1.0.\n\nAn example of the pldPL functionality already in use is the pldUkr executable
  of the\nr-glpk-phonetic-languages-ukrainian-durations package. For more information,
  please,\nrefer to: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/r-glpk-phonetic-languages-ukrainian-durations\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn
  the file EnglishConcatenated.txt in the source tarball there are English words the
  translations of which are intended to be\nconcatenated to the next word in the phonetic
  language before applying sound processing so that the basic grammar is preserved.\n\nDevotion\n========\n\nThe
  author would like to devote this project to support the [Foundation\nGastrostars](https://gastrostars.nl).\n\nOn
  the 22/09/2023 there is Nathalie's Kok birthday, the mother of the founder of the
  Foundation,\n[Emma Kok](https://www.emmakok.nl), and the member of the Foundation
