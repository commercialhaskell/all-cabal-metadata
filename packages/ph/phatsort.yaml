  # `phatsort-haskell` Changelog

  This project follows the [Haskell package versioning policy][PVP], with
  versions in `A.B.C.D` format.  `A` may be incremented arbitrarily for
  non-technical reasons, but [semantic versioning][SemVer] is otherwise
  followed, where `A.B` is the major version, `C` is the minor version, and `D`
  is the patch version.  Initial development uses versions `0.0.0.D`, for which
  every version is considered breaking.

  [PVP]: <https://pvp.haskell.org/>
  [SemVer]: <https://semver.org/>

  The format of this changelog is based on [Keep a Changelog][KaC], with the
  following conventions:

  * Level-two heading `Unreleased` is used to track changes that have not been
    released.
  * Other level-two headings specify the release in `A.B.C.D (YYYY-MM-DD)`
    format, with newer versions above older versions.
  * Level-three headings are used to categorize changes as follows:
      1. Breaking
      2. Non-Breaking
  * Changes are listed in arbitrary order and present tense.

  ## Overview

  The PhatSort project provides two command-line utilities for sorting files
  and directories on FAT filesystems.  The `phatsort` utility sorts files and
  directories that are already on the filesystem.  The `seqcp` utility copies
  files and directories to the filesystem in sorted order.

  There are many MP3 players that allow you to mount the device as external
  storage and manage the media yourself.  The storage generally uses a FAT
  filesystem.  When copying multiple files onto the storage, using the command
  line (`cp`/`mv`) or a GUI, they are generally stored in an arbitrary order.
  This is not a problem if the firmware of the MP3 player sorts by filename, but
  many MP3 players use the order in the FAT filesystem without sorting, which
  results in podcasts and album tracks being played out of order.

  There are some utilities that sort the FAT tables of an unmounted filesystem.
  (See [Related Software](#related-software) for information and links.)
  Unfortunately, there are many devices for which this does not work.  PhatSort
  takes a different approach to solving the problem.  It works by creating new
  directories and moving ("renaming") the files in the desired order, while the
  filesystem is mounted.  This method works on all devices that have been tried
  so far.

  PhatSort also (optionally) forces the filesystem buffers to be written to the
  storage media after each change.  This helps avoid write failures when using
  devices that have problems with writing large amounts of data.  Note that the
  `seqcp` utility helps with this issue even on non-FAT filesystems.

  ## CLI

  ### Requirements

  PhatSort has only been tested on Linux.  It *might* work on other operating
  systems.  Scripts that are output use POSIX shell commands and therefore
  require a POSIX shell to execute.

  ### Installation

  #### `.deb` Package Installation

  Check the [Releases][] page for `.deb` packages.

  #### `.rpm` Package Installation

  [Releases]: <https://github.com/ExtremaIS/phatsort-haskell/releases>

  Check the [Releases][] page for `.rpm` packages.

  #### Installation From Hackage

  Install PhatSort from [Hackage][] using [Cabal][] as follows:

  ```
  $ cabal v2-install phatsort
  ```

  [Hackage]: <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/phatsort>
  [Cabal]: <https://www.haskell.org/cabal/>

  #### Installation From Stackage

  Install PhatSort from [Stackage][] using [Stack][] as follows:

  ```
  $ stack install phatsort
  ```

  [Stackage]: <https://www.stackage.org/package/phatsort>
  [Stack]: <https://haskellstack.org/>

  ### Usage

  See the [`phatsort`][] and [`seqcp`][] man pages for usage information.

  [`phatsort`]: <doc/phatsort.1.md>
  [`seqcp`]: <doc/seqcp.1.md>

  ## Related Software

  [`FATSort`][] is a command-line utility that sorts unmounted FAT filesystems
  by direct manipulation of the FAT tables.  Unfortunately, there are many
  devices for which this does not work.

  [`YAFS`][] is a command-line utility that sorts unmounted FAT filesystems by
  direct manipulation of the FAT tables.  [`Visual YAFS`][] provides a GUI.  I
  have not tried either of these.

  [`DriveSort`][] is Windows GUI software that sorts unmounted FAT filesystems
  by direct manipulation of the FAT tables.  I have not tried it.

  ### Branches

  The `main` branch is reserved for releases.  It may be considered stable, and
  `HEAD` is always the latest release.

  The `develop` branch is the primary development branch.  It contains changes
  that have not yet been released, and it is not necessarily stable.

  [Hackage revisions][] are made for metadata changes, such as relaxation of
  constraints when new versions of dependencies are released.  The
  `phatsort.cabal` metadata in the `main` branch may therefore not match that of
  Hackage.  The `phatsort.cabal` metadata in the `develop` branch may match,
  *unless* work is being done on a new release that contains other changes.

  ### Tags

  All releases are tagged in the `main` branch.  Release tags are signed using
  the [`security@extrema.is` GPG key][].
