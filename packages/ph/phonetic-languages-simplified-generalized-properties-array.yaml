  ## 0.4.1.0 -- 2021-07-30

  * Fourth version revised A. Fixed issues with the fixed point of 1.0 (arising from the issue in the dependency package
  phonetic-languages-rhythmicity).

  * Sixth version. Added new properties lines of "C", "N", "W", "X", "Y", "Z" and updated some previous ones to

  Changed the dependency boundaries of phonetic-languages-rhythmicity.

  ## 0.7.0.0 -- 2021-08-16

  * Seventh version. Some code improvements. Added also the properties with weighted functions that try to increase
  the importance of the line ending and to decrease the importance of the beginnings.
