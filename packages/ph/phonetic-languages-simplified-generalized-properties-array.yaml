changelog: "# Revision history for phonetic-languages-simplified-generalized-properties-array\n\n##
  0.1.0.0 -- 2021-05-04\n\n* First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n##
  0.1.0.1 -- 2021-05-06\n\n* First version revised A. Some code improvements.\n\n##
  0.1.0.2 -- 2021-05-07\n\n* First version revised B. Changed the dependency boundaries
  of the phonetic-languages-phonetics-basics.\n\n## 0.1.1.0 -- 2021-05-10\n\n* First
  version revised C. Some documentation improvements. Changed the dependency boundaries.\n\n##
  0.1.2.0 -- 2021-05-19\n\n* First version revised D. Changed the dependency boundaries.\n\n##
  0.2.0.0 -- 2021-06-04\n\n* Second version. Changed the code related to the breaking
  update of the phonetic-languages-phonetics-basics package.\n\n## 0.3.0.0 -- 2021-07-21\n\n*
  Third version. Added the \"w\" and \"x\" lines support to the properties.\n\n##
  0.4.0.0 -- 2021-07-28\n\n* Fourth version. Added new properties (\"c\"-, \"u\"-,
  \"v\"-, \"s\"- and \"t\"-lines) to the module Phonetic.Languages.Array.General.PropertiesSyllablesG2.\nSome
  code improvements (reduced duplication).\nChanged the dependency boundaries for
  phonetic-languages-rhythmicity and phonetic-languages-phonetics-basics.\n\n## 0.4.1.0
  -- 2021-07-30\n\n* Fourth version revised A. Fixed issues with the fixed point of
  1.0 (arising from the issue in the dependency package\nphonetic-languages-rhythmicity).\n\n##
  0.4.2.0 -- 2021-07-31\n\n* Fourth version revised B. Some code improvements (reduced
  duplication). Fixed issues with vice versa of the\n'0' and not '0' functions.\n\n##
  0.5.0.0 -- 2021-08-09\n\n* Fifth version. Changed the behavior for the new recent
  properties added so that they are now more linearized.\nChanged the dependency boundaries
  for the package phonetic-languages-rhythmicity.\n\n## 0.6.0.0 -- 2021-08-14\n\n*
  Sixth version. Added new properties lines of \"C\", \"N\", \"W\", \"X\", \"Y\",
  \"Z\" and updated some previous ones to\nuse the possibilities of the weighted improtance
  of lines (just some experimental functions at the moment).\nChanged the dependency
  boundaries of phonetic-languages-rhythmicity.\n\n## 0.7.0.0 -- 2021-08-16\n\n* Seventh
  version. Some code improvements. Added also the properties with weighted functions
  that try to increase\nthe importance of the line ending and to decrease the importance
  of the beginnings.\n\n## 0.8.0.0 -- 2021-08-17\n\n* Eigth version. Fixed issues
  with wrong mapping. Some code improvements. Added also the properties with linear\nweighted
  functions.\n\n## 0.8.1.0 -- 2021-08-24\n\n* Eigth version revised A. Switched to
  the new version of the phonetic-languages-rhythmicity that fixed the issues with\ncustom
  user defined new polyrhythmicity choices.\n\n## 0.8.2.0 -- 2021-10-04\n\n* Eigth
  version revised B. Updated the dependency boundaries.\n\n## 0.8.3.0 -- 2022-01-13\n\n*
  Eigth version revised C. Updated the dependency boundaries so that the early 0.13.*
  series of the \nphonetic-languages-simplified-generalized-examples-array package
  can be easily updated. \n\n## 0.8.4.0 -- 2022-01-16\n\n* Eigth version revised D.
  Updated the dependency boundaries of the for just easier update of the dependent
  packages.\n\n## 0.8.5.0 -- 2022-01-17\n\n* Eigth version revised E. Updated the
  dependency boundaries of the for just easier update of the dependent packages.\n\n##
  0.9.0.0 -- 2022-02-09\n\n* Ninth version. Changed the dependency boundaries and
  introduced the breaking \nchanges to the code. Please, update to  the new version
  and check the existing code.\n\n## 0.10.0.0 -- 2022-05-31\n\n* Tenth version. Changed
  the dependecies to simplify the development.\n\n## 0.10.1.0 -- 2022-05-31\n\n* Tenth
  version revised A. Removed the unneeded dependency of phonetic-languages-simplified-base.\n\n##
  0.11.0.0 -- 2022-08-09\n\n* Eleventh version. Added the new module Phonetic.Languages.EmphasisG.
  Switched to the \nnew model of computations with the possibly two modes instead
  of just one -- PhoPaaW and \nSaaW. Some code improvements.\n\n## 0.12.0.0 -- 2022-09-13\n\n*
  Twelfth version. Moved the common functionality for coeffs to the phonetic-languages-basis
  package. Added new functionality to use diverse2GGL function.\n\n## 0.13.0.0 --
  2023-03-02\n\n* Thirteenth version. Switched to the NoImplicitPrelude extension.
  Some code deduplication. Updated\n  the dependencies boundaries to use the new functionality.
  \n\n## 0.13.1.0 -- 2023-03-15\n\n* Thirteenth version revised A. Updated the dependecies
  boundaries so that to support the new \ncode deduplication for different implementations
  of PhLADiPreLiO.\n\n"
