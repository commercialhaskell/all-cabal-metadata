synopsis: A generalized functionality of PhLADiPreLiO for different languages that
  uses hash algorithms.
changelog: "# Revision history for phladiprelio-general-simple\n\n## 0.1.0.0 -- 2023-03-12\n\n*
  First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n## 0.1.1.0 -- 2023-03-12\n\n*
  First version revised A. Improved the documentation with links to new documentation
  and video\n  recordings.\n\n## 0.1.2.0 -- 2023-03-17\n\n* First version revised
  B. Updated the dependencies and documentation.\n\n## 0.2.0.0 -- 2023-03-19\n\n*
  Second version. Added new functionality related to the reverse order of sorting
  and printing\nthe results in the default modes and the test for 'smoothness' of
  the line while reading,\nspeaking, singing etc.\n\n## 0.2.1.0 -- 2023-03-27\n\n*
  Second version revised A. Added the possibility to use \"-t 2\" as options to perform
  weaker and\nmore permissive test for irregularities that influence the prosody.\n\n##
  0.2.2.0 -- 2023-03-29\n\n* Second version revised B. Added the possibility to use
  \"-t 3\" as options to perform test related\nto search potentially the most irregular
  or unstable line options. Added the possibility to specify\nthe own hash step with
  \"+k\" command line option. Updated the dependency boundaries.\n\n## 0.2.3.0 --
  2023-04-04\n\n* Second version revised C. Added the possibility to see example lines
  for minimum and maximum values\n  for the properties in the test mode using the
  \"-t <one of 4, 5, or 6>\" command line arguments.\n\n## 0.2.4.0 -- 2023-04-17\n\n*
  Second version revised D. Added the possibility to see example lines for minimum
  and maximum values\nfor the properties in  the test mode using the \"-t <one of
  7, 8, or 9>\" command line arguments.\n\n## 0.3.0.0 -- 2023-05-13\n\n* Third version.
  Added two new command line groups of arguments - \"-p\" (no minimal grammar\nrules
  application) and \"+a ... -a\" (constraints). Updated documentation (especially
  new pdfs). \nAdded new lightweight dependencies. \n\n## 0.4.0.0 -- 2023-05-24\n\n*
  Fourth version. Added two new command line groups of arguments - \"+l\" (add empty
  line to output for \nnot test option) and +b ... -b with the extended group of constraints
  handling. Extended the \nset of constraints with new ones and now  there are 12
  types of them. Some documentation\nimprovements. Fixed issues with the numbering
  in the constraints. \nUpdated the documentation and dependencies boundaries. \n\n##
  0.4.1.0 -- 2023-05-25\n\n* Fourth version revised A. Fixed issues with operator
  precedence (&&) and (||). Now should behave \nas defined in Haskell itself (as usual).
  \n\n## 0.4.2.0 -- 2023-06-01\n\n* Fourth version revised B. Fixed issues with spaces
  in the +b ... -b and some other ones with \nthe dependency package phonetic-languages-constraints-array.
  The algebraic constraint with\nparentheses still does not work properly. This is
  a known issue and should be fixed in the further\nreleases. So  this is an intermediate
  testing release.\n\n## 0.5.0.0 -- 2023-06-02\n\n* Fifth version. Fixed issues with
  incorrect parentheses behaviour for +b ... -b command line\n  arguments group. Updated
  the corresponding dependency boundaries. Added much more variants of\ntests (to
  improve mostly performance characteristics). \n\n## 0.6.0.0 -- 2023-06-15\n\n* Sixth
  version. Fixed some issues with tests output for all platforms and issues with output
  for\n  Windows users for non-tests functionality. Added new constraint of U. Updated
  the documentation.\nAdded two new command line options - +w and +f which allows
  to specify the output mode for \nprinting in the terminal window and printing the
  result to the file. Added new dependencies. \nSwitched to the two-column ouput as
  a usual one for non-tests functionality.\n\n## 0.6.1.0 -- 2023-06-23\n\n* Sixth
  version revised A. Updated dependencies. Fixed some issues with printing the resulting
  \ninformation.\n\n## 0.6.2.0 -- 2023-06-24\n\n* Sixth version revised B. Switched
  to the newer version of dependencies so that the library can be \nsuccessfully compiled
  with GHC-9.6.2 compiler.\n\n"

description: "The library is the new implementation of the ideas related to PhLADiPreLiO
  (Phonetic Languages\nApproach to Discovering the Preferred Line Options) for different
  languages. It uses hashes and\nhas at the moment (as of the version 0.6.0.0) not
  the full functionality. The previous implementation \nand its documentation are
  at the links:\n\nhttps://hackage.haskell.org/package/phonetic-languages-simplified-generalized-examples-array\n\n[Ukrainian
  documentation](https://oleksandrzhabenko.github.io/uk/rhythmicity/PhLADiPreLiO.Ukr.21.pdf)\n\n[English
  documentation](https://oleksandrzhabenko.github.io/uk/rhythmicity/PhLADiPreLiO.Eng.21.pdf)\n\nThe
  documentation for  the  new implementation is available at the following links.\n[Новий

  implementation](https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/rhythmicity/phladiprelioEng.7.pdf)\n\nSince
  the version 0.6.0.0 the default mode for non-tests output is in two-column. This
  improves \nthe UI / UX for the end user. Besides there is the possibility to write
  the result to a file.\n\nThe video with the demonstration of the new functionality
  in the version 0.6.0.0 is by the link for\nthe parallel project phladiprelio-ukrainian-simple:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/100012184148486/posts/1767318773684244\n\nExamples
  of the new functionality in the version 0.5.1.1 of the related prototype project
  for \nUkrainian is in the videos:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid033gzq8MCRQsm65mPrzJL25MZNgvW7mezQSywULiVMnqmTBMtSW2jW4ABh6HVMWZNLl\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid05mMCUu5HVoA6aV4kLJ69tQZHyhTRZgXLRvtdLitWCm6JeB2T2ktfkd2opfjjgTxFl\n\nVideo
