  First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n## 0.1.1.0 -- 2023-03-12\n\n*
  First version revised A. Improved the documentation with links to new documentation
  and video\n  recordings.\n\n## 0.1.2.0 -- 2023-03-17\n\n* First version revised
  B. Updated the dependencies and documentation.\n\n## 0.2.0.0 -- 2023-03-19\n\n*
  Second version. Added new functionality related to the reverse order of sorting
  and printing\nthe results in the default modes and the test for 'smoothness' of
  the line while reading,\nspeaking, singing etc.\n\n## 0.2.1.0 -- 2023-03-27\n\n*
  Second version revised A. Added the possibility to use \"-t 2\" as options to perform
  weaker and\nmore permissive test for irregularities that influence the prosody.\n\n##
  0.2.2.0 -- 2023-03-29\n\n* Second version revised B. Added the possibility to use
  \"-t 3\" as options to perform test related\nto search potentially the most irregular
  or unstable line options. Added the possibility to specify\nthe own hash step with
  \"+k\" command line option. Updated the dependency boundaries.\n\n## 0.2.3.0 --
  2023-04-04\n\n* Second version revised C. Added the possibility to see example lines
  for minimum and maximum values\n  for the properties in the test mode using the
  \"-t <one of 4, 5, or 6>\" command line arguments.\n\n## 0.2.4.0 -- 2023-04-17\n\n*
  Second version revised D. Added the possibility to see example lines for minimum
  and maximum values\nfor the properties in  the test mode using the \"-t <one of
  7, 8, or 9>\" command line arguments.\n\n## 0.3.0.0 -- 2023-05-13\n\n* Third version.
  Added two new command line groups of arguments - \"-p\" (no minimal grammar\nrules
  application) and \"+a ... -a\" (constraints). Updated documentation (especially
  new pdfs). \nAdded new lightweight dependencies. \n\n## 0.4.0.0 -- 2023-05-24\n\n*
  Fourth version. Added two new command line groups of arguments - \"+l\" (add empty
  line to output for \nnot test option) and +b ... -b with the extended group of constraints
  handling. Extended the \nset of constraints with new ones and now  there are 12
  types of them. Some documentation\nimprovements. Fixed issues with the numbering
  in the constraints. \nUpdated the documentation and dependencies boundaries. \n\n##
  0.4.1.0 -- 2023-05-25\n\n* Fourth version revised A. Fixed issues with operator
  precedence (&&) and (||). Now should behave \nas defined in Haskell itself (as usual).
  \n\n## 0.4.2.0 -- 2023-06-01\n\n* Fourth version revised B. Fixed issues with spaces
  in the +b ... -b and some other ones with \nthe dependency package phonetic-languages-constraints-array.
  The algebraic constraint with\nparentheses still does not work properly. This is
  a known issue and should be fixed in the further\nreleases. So  this is an intermediate
  testing release.\n\n## 0.5.0.0 -- 2023-06-02\n\n* Fifth version. Fixed issues with
  incorrect parentheses behaviour for +b ... -b command line\n  arguments group. Updated
  the corresponding dependency boundaries. Added much more variants of\ntests (to
  improve mostly performance characteristics). \n\n## 0.6.0.0 -- 2023-06-15\n\n* Sixth
  version. Fixed some issues with tests output for all platforms and issues with output
  for\n  Windows users for non-tests functionality. Added new constraint of U. Updated
  the documentation.\nAdded two new command line options - +w and +f which allows
  to specify the output mode for \nprinting in the terminal window and printing the
  result to the file. Added new dependencies. \nSwitched to the two-column ouput as
  a usual one for non-tests functionality.\n\n## 0.6.1.0 -- 2023-06-23\n\n* Sixth
  version revised A. Updated dependencies. Fixed some issues with printing the resulting
  \ninformation.\n\n## 0.6.2.0 -- 2023-06-24\n\n* Sixth version revised B. Switched
  to the newer version of dependencies so that the library can be \nsuccessfully compiled
  with GHC-9.6.2 compiler.\n\n## 0.7.0.0 -- 2023-07-30\n\n* Seventh version. Added
  asynchronous concurrent calculations and async as a package dependency. Added\n
  \ the possibility to calculate for the text with maximum 9 words or their combinations
  (using +x\ncommand line option). Added new draft papers with improved theory about
  the usage of the software.\n\n## 0.7.0.1 -- 2023-07-30\n\n* Seventh version revised
  A. Fixed some issues with documentation.\n\n## 0.8.0.0 -- 2023-08-14\n\n* Eighth
  version. Added the possibility for 2-syllable meter to print additional information
  about\npoints of incongruences of the line for +f group of command line arguments
  (using +f <filename for saving> <code> where code is in the range of (10..19) inclusively).
  \nAdded the possibility to work with multiline files as the input of the program
  on the per line basis using +m group\ncommand line arguments. Moved the shared with
  phladiprelio-ukrainian-simple code to the new package \nphladiprelio-tests to reduce
  code duplication. Updated the dependencies.\n\n## 0.9.0.0 -- 2023-09-22\n\n* Ninth
  version. Added new function argsProcessing to the library. Some code and documentation
  improvements. Updated the dependencies boundaries. Added devotion to Nathalie Kok
  on her Birthday.\n\n## 0.9.0.1 -- 2023-09-22\n\n* Ninth version revised A. Fixed
  issue with the inaccurate description in the calab file.\n\n## 0.10.0.0 -- 2023-10-01\n\n*
  Tenth version. Added the possibility to use the \"music\" mode that is intended
  for better lyrics\n  and music composing. Fixed issue with +x command line arguments.\nUpdated
  dependencies. Some documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.11.0.0 -- 2023-11-01\n\n*
  Eleventh version. Added a new command line argument \"+ul\" with additional argument
  to compute not\n  usual rhythmicity properties, but diversity property of the sounds
  represented by the encoded \nadditional string. Added video example for the parallel
  project phladiprelio-ukrainian-simple\nshowing the new functionality usage for Ukrainian
  language.\n\n## 0.11.1.0 -- 2023-11-06\n\n* Eleventh version revised A. Added a
  possibility to use +dc group of command line arguments that \nallow to specify whether
  to add <br> html tag to each line in the two-column output and to what file\nprint
  additionally two-column output.\n\n## 0.12.0.0 -- 2023-11-11\n\n* Twelfth version.
  Added a new functionality related to the comparison of similarity of two\n  lists.
  Use for this +l2 ... -l2 group  of command line options. This leads to changes in
  functions\nsignatures, too.\n\n"

description: "The library is the new implementation of the ideas related to PhLADiPreLiO
  (Phonetic Languages\nApproach to Discovering the Preferred Line Options) for different
  languages. It uses hashes and\nhas at the moment (as of the version 0.7.0.0) not
  the full functionality. The previous implementation \nand its documentation are

  implementation](https://oleksandr-zhabenko.github.io/uk/rhythmicity/phladiprelioEng.7.pdf)\n\nThe
  examples of the using the new functionality in the 0.8.0.0 version is in two short
  videos by\nthe links below (they are for the phladiprelio-ukrainian-simple, the
  parallel project for Ukranian):\n\n[+f <filename> <code> mode additions](https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/videos/593118766229253/)\n\n[+m
  <another filename> <another code> mode — new one in this version](https://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/videos/325188039864718/)\n\nSince
  the version 0.6.0.0 the default mode for non-tests output is in two-column. This
  improves \nthe UI / UX for the end user. Besides there is the possibility to write
  the result to a file.\n\nThe video with the demonstration of the new functionality
  in the version 0.6.0.0 is by the link for\nthe parallel project phladiprelio-ukrainian-simple:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/100012184148486/posts/1767318773684244\n\nExamples
  of the new functionality in the version 0.5.1.1 of the related prototype project
  for \nUkrainian is in the videos:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid033gzq8MCRQsm65mPrzJL25MZNgvW7mezQSywULiVMnqmTBMtSW2jW4ABh6HVMWZNLl\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Oleksandr.S.Zhabenko/posts/pfbid05mMCUu5HVoA6aV4kLJ69tQZHyhTRZgXLRvtdLitWCm6JeB2T2ktfkd2opfjjgTxFl\n\nVideo

  on the example\nof the parallel project usage:\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zapAPpQ-fc4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zapAPpQ-fc4)\n\nSince
  the version 0.12.0.0 there is a possibility to compare the distances (opposite to
  the\nsimilarity measure) for the line options using the +l2 ... -l2 command line
  group of options. It is\ngenerally a completely new functionality for the package.\n\nFor
  the list of bash aliases a few of which are used in the videos, see:\nhttps://github.com/Oleksandr-Zhabenko/phladiprelio-alias/blob/main/.bashrc\n\n
