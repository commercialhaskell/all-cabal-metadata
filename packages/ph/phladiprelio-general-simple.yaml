synopsis: A generalized functionality of PhLADiPreLiO for different languages that
  uses hash algorithms.
changelog: "# Revision history for phladiprelio-general-simple\n\n## 0.1.0.0 -- 2023-03-12\n\n*
  First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n## 0.1.1.0 -- 2023-03-12\n\n*
  First version revised A. Improved the documentation with links to new documentation
  and video\n  recordings.\n\n## 0.1.2.0 -- 2023-03-17\n\n* First version revised
  B. Updated the dependencies and documentation.\n\n## 0.2.0.0 -- 2023-03-19\n\n*
  Second version. Added new functionality related to the reverse order of sorting
  and printing\nthe results in the default modes and the test for 'smoothness' of
  the line while reading,\nspeaking, singing etc.\n\n## 0.2.1.0 -- 2023-03-27\n\n*
  Second version revised A. Added the possibility to use \"-t 2\" as options to perform
  weaker and\nmore permissive test for irregularities that influence the prosody.\n\n##
  0.2.2.0 -- 2023-03-29\n\n* Second version revised B. Added the possibility to use
  \"-t 3\" as options to perform test related\nto search potentially the most irregular
  or unstable line options. Added the possibility to specify\nthe own hash step with
  \"+k\" command line option. Updated the dependency boundaries.\n\n## 0.2.3.0 --
  2023-04-04\n\n* Second version revised C. Added the possibility to see example lines
  for minimum and maximum values\n  for the properties in the test mode using the
  \"-t <one of 4, 5, or 6>\" command line arguments.\n\n## 0.2.4.0 -- 2023-04-17\n\n*
  Second version revised D. Added the possibility to see example lines for minimum
  and maximum values\nfor the properties in  the test mode using the \"-t <one of
  7, 8, or 9>\" command line arguments.\n\n## 0.3.0.0 -- 2023-05-13\n\n* Third version.
  Added two new command line groups of arguments - \"-p\" (no minimal grammar\nrules
  application) and \"+a ... -a\" (constraints). Updated documentation (especially
  new pdfs). \nAdded new lightweight dependencies. \n\n## 0.4.0.0 -- 2023-05-24\n\n*
  Fourth version. Added two new command line groups of arguments - \"+l\" (add empty
  line to output for \nnot test option) and +b ... -b with the extended group of constraints
  handling. Extended the \nset of constraints with new ones and now  there are 12
  types of them. Some documentation\nimprovements. Fixed issues with the numbering
  in the constraints. \nUpdated the documentation and dependencies boundaries. \n\n"

description: "The library is the new implementation of the ideas related to PhLADiPreLiO
  (Phonetic Languages\nApproach to Discovering the Preferred Line Options) for different
  languages. It uses hashes and\nhas at the moment (as of the version 0.4.0.0) not
  the full functionality. The previous implementation \nand its documentation are
