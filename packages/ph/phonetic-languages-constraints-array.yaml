changelog: "# Revision history for phonetic-languages-constraints-array\n\n## 0.1.0.0
  -- 2020-12-31\n\n* First version. Released to the world.\n\n## 0.1.1.0 -- 2022-03-24\n\n*
  First version revised A. Updated the dependency boundaries to support the latest
  GHC and Cabal versions. Added some experimental functions that \nare not further
  used.\n\n## 0.1.2.0 -- 2022-04-25\n\n* First version revised B. Added the new constraint
  P functionality.\n\n## 0.2.0.0 -- 2023-01-31\n\n* Second version. Switched to NoImplicitPrelude
  extension. Changed the names of the modules. Updated the dependencies boundaries.\n\n##
  0.3.0.0 -- 2023-05-15\n\n* Third version. Added new types of constraints based on
  the signed and unsigned distance(s)\nbetween two or three elements (encoded with
  the capital letters V, W, H, R).\n\n## 0.4.0.0 -- 2023-05-15\n\n* Fourth version.
  Added a new type of constraint based on both signed and unsigned distances\nbetween
  three elements (encoded with M). Some documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.4.1.0
  -- 2023-05-16\n\n* Fourth version revised. Changed the number of parameters for
  the new constructors added. Added\nisM function to the export from the module.\n\n##
  0.5.0.0 -- 2023-05-17\n\n* Fifth version. Changed representation in the EncodedCnstr
  data type. Removed the readMaybeEC\nfunction. Reduced code duplication. Switched
  the way of counting -- moved all to one natural base\nof 1 and more.\n\n## 0.6.0.0
  -- 2023-05-22 \n\n* Sixth version. Added new functions to the Phladiprelio.Constraints
  module for negated constraints. \nAdded some boolean algebra interpeter for constraints
  to Phladiprelio.ConstraintsEncoded module. \nAdded README.md file and devotion of
  the project to Foundation Gastrostars. \n\n## 0.6.1.0 -- 2023-05-23\n\n* Sixth version
  revised A. Added new function filterGeneralConv to Phladiprelio.ConstraintsEncoded
  \nmodule. Added also validOrdStr to the export list in the module. Some minor documentation\nimprovements.
  \n\n## 0.6.1.1 -- 2023-05-23\n\n* Sixth version revised B. Some minor code improvements.\n\n##
  0.6.2.0 -- 2023-05-25\n\n* Sixth version revised C. Fixed the issues with precedence
  of the (&&) and (||) logical operators. \nNow it should behave as usual and as is
  defined in Haskell98 and Haskell2010. \n\n## 0.7.0.0 -- 2023-05-31\n\n* Seventh
  version. Added new constraints encoding to the Phladiprelio.ContstraintsEncoded
  module \n(N, D, I). Some documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.7.0.1 -- 2023-05-31\n\n*
  Seventh version revised A. Some minor documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.7.1.0
  -- 2023-06-01\n\n* Seventh version revised B. Fixed some issues with incorrect False
  validation for algebraic constraints\nhandling that lead to no constraints at all
  for applications and in the oneChange function with \nincorrect foldr function definition.
  Now the algebraic constraints functionality should work better \n(hopefully, as
  expected).\n\n## 0.7.2.0 -- 2023-06-02\n\n* Seventh version revised C. Fixed issue
  with the shadowing of the variable in the lambda function\nin the oneChange function
  definition that leads to incorrect behaviour of the parentheses handling.\nSome
  minor documentation and code improvements.\n\n## 0.7.3.0 -- 2023-06-06\n\n* Seventh
  version revised D. Added new constraint type U for five elements. Switched to bit\n
  \ algorithms in some functions (mostly for testing and more readable code). \n\n##
  0.8.0.0 -- 2024-01-27\n\n* Eighth version. Updated the dependencies and switched
  to monoid-insertleft instead of subG. Added specializing and inlining for some functions
  to improve performance. Some documentation improvements.\n\n"

description: " Devotion\n ========\n\nSince the 0.6.0.0 version, the author would
  like to devote this project to support the [Foundation Gastrostars](https://gastrostars.nl).\n\nThe
  foundation founder is [Emma Kok](https://www.emmakok.nl).\n\nOn the 06/01/2024 there
  is Sophie's Kok, a sister of Emma Kok, 19th Birthday (she is 18). Therefore, the
  version 0.5.0.0 is additionally devoted also to her. On the 22/01/2023 there is
  Day of Unity of Ukraine, and on the 23/01/2024 the Orthodox Christians have memory
  of St. Paulinus of Nola.\n\nBesides, you can support Ukraine and Ukrainian people.
  \n\nAll support is welcome, including donations for the needs of the Ukrainian army,
  IDPs and refugees.\n\nIf you would like to share some financial support with Gastrostars,
  please, contact the mentioned foundation\nusing the URL:\n\n[Contact Foundation
