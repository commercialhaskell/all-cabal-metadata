  # Revision history for phonetic-languages-filters-array

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2020-12-31

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2021-10-30

  * Second version. Switched to the Case.Hashable.Cuckoo.getBFstL' function and the cuckoo hashtables.
  Updated the dependencies boundaries.

  ## 0.3.0.0 -- 2021-10-31

  * Third version. Switched back to the CaseBi.Arr.getBFstLSorted' function.

  ## 0.4.0.0 -- 2022-04-25

  * Fourth version. Fixed issue with incorrectly defined functions unsafeRearrangeIGV and unsafeSwapIWithMaxI
  that influence almost all the module functionality. This means that all the results obtained earlier with these
  functions or that ones that use them  must be checked and fixed.

  ## 0.5.0.0 -- 2022-08-22

  * Fifth version. Fixed issues with the unsafeSwapVecIWithMaxI. Changed the described semantics of  the
  functions. Please, check the updated documentation. Added new variant of  the function unsafeRearrangeIG.

  ## 0.6.0.0 -- 2023-01-31

  * Sixth version. Switched to NoImplicitPrelude and Strict extensions. Some code improvements. Removed the deprecated duplicate function. Updated the dependencies boundaries.
