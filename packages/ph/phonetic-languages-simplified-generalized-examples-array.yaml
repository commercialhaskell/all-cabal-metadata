  Added new lines of properties for the (hypothetic) polyrhythmicity handling. Among them
  "c", "s", "t", "u", "v" lines are. Changed the documentation appropriately. Changed the dependencies
  boundaries. Added the possibility to 'grow lines' to Phonetic.Languages.General.Lines and
  Phonetic.Languages.General.GetTextualInfo modules.

  ## 0.6.1.0 -- 2021-07-30

  * Sixth version revised A. Fixed issues with the fixed point of 1.0 (arising from the issue in the dependency package
  phonetic-languages-rhythmicity).

  * Eigth version. Changed the dependency boundaries and added new weighted properties and fixed some issues with
  the previous ones so that they use more complete information. Added the handler for the case of the empty line for
  the Simple submodule and related functionality. Some documentation improvements.

  ## 0.8.1.0 -- 2021-08-15

  * Eigth version revised A. Fixed issue with the wrong order and, therefore, mapping for different choices and
  the corresponding properties in the module Phonetic.Languages.Simplified.Array.General.FuncRep2RelatedG2.

  ## 0.9.0.0 -- 2021-08-16

  * Ninth version. Added new properties that try to increase the importance of the ending of the line and decrease
  the importance of the beginning of the line. Added new dependency of string-interpreter. Added the possibility
  to run Phonetic.Languages.General.Simple module functions in the recursive interactive mode. It is not
  compatible with the contstraints so should be used not simultaneously with them (because they change their meaning).
  Some documentation improvements.

  ## 0.10.0.0 -- 2021-08-17

  * The tenth version. Added new linear weighted properties. Fixed some issues with wrong mapping. Some documentation
  improvements.

  count in the recursive mode not just from the beginning of the word concatenation but also from the end using
  the commonly used programming pattern of the negative integer indexing. Updated the dependencies so that now
  it can use multiple improvements of the dependencies. Some documentation improvements.

  ## 0.11.1.0 -- 2021-09-08

  * The eleventh version revised B. Fixed issue with the phonetic-languages-plus dependency being not built. Updated
  the dependency boundaries.

  The version 0.2.0.0 is prepared to the Day of the Saints Cyril and Methodius, the 'Apostles to the Slavs',
  and to the Day of Slavic writing systems and culture.

  The functions in the modules Phonetic.Languages.General.Simple.Parsing, Phonetic.Languages.General.Lines.Parsing,
  Phonetic.Languages.General.GetInfo.Parsing highly depend on the data types in the phonetic-languages-phonetics-basics
  package.

  They use the parsing with the failing possibilities, so for them, to work properly, you need to specify every
  piece of data accordingly to the specifications in the imported modules and in the new modules themselves.

  Otherwise, the functions definitely will not work correctly.

  Are provided mainly for testing purposes, may be not enough performant for production usage.

   Espeak-ng Additional Usage and IPA
   ==================================

  You can use additionally the espeak-ng program (see: https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng) and in the
  Unix / Linux terminal (bash shell) you can enter as a command something like:

  cat - | tr -d [:punct:] | espeak-ng -v{lang} -x -g 1 -s 130 --ipa

  where {lang} is the needed language code (see, the output of the espeak-ng --voices and besides the manual page for
  the espeak-ng).

  The IPA symbols information can be taken from the https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/content/full-ipa-chart
  or the https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/sites/default/files/phonsymbol.pdf
  Please, take into account the license information: the IPA chart and all its subparts

  See http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ for further description.

  It is rather easy to create the corresponding GWritingSystemPRPLX information using the IPA, but you can use
  some other respesentation. The idea for this is that you can use IPA line produced by the espeak-ng as the
  input 'String'.

   Some Ideas to Be Checked (Hypotheses)
   =====================================

  The phonetic-languages-simplified-generalized-examples-array library is based on the idea of the defined
  phonetic phenomenae durations in time while speaking. Definitely, they have some durations, the question of
  interest is that there are no stable ones, immutable ones. The durations vary not only from situation to situation,
  from one speaker to another one, from circumstances etc., but also the durations for some phonemes can vary
  depending on their neighbouring ones and, therefore, being some (probably, a new one in every case) function
  of the neighbour phonemes. This fact is not taken into account in this version of the package and library, but
  it has some meaning.

   A Child Learns to Read, or Somebody New to the Language
   =======================================================

  When a child just begins to read words in the language (or, there can be just somebody new to the language) he or she
  starts with phonemes pronunciation for every meaningful written (and, hence, read) symbol. Afterwards, after some
  practice, he / she starts to read smoothly. Nevertheless, if the text is actually a poetic piece, e. g. some
  poem, it is OFTEN (may be, usually, or sometimes, or occasionally, etc.) just evident that the text being read
  in such a manner has some rhythmicity properties, despite the fact that the phonemes are read and pronounced in
  a manner of irregular and to some extent irrelevant to the normal speech mode lengths (durations). We can
  distinguish (often) the poetic text from the non-poetic one just by some arrangement of the elements.

  The same situation occurs when a person with an accent (probably, strong, or rather uncommon) reads a poetic text.
  Or in other situations. The library design works just as in these situations. It assumes predefined durations, but
  having several reasonable (sensible) ones we can evaluate (approximately, of course) the rhythmicity properties
  and some other ones, just as the algorithms provided here.

  This, to the mind of the author, is a ground for using the library and its functionality in such cases.

   Using the Espeak and IPA functionality
   ======================================

  You can use the EspeakNG_IPA module for this since the 0.4.0.0 version.

   "w" and "x" Series of properties
   ================================

  Since the 0.5.0.0 version you can use also "w" and "x" series (lines) of properties. They use more complex
  approach and are intended for 4 elements in the rhythmic groups. For more information, please, refer to the
  section 'WX argument' in the English instruction:
  https://oleksandrzhabenko.github.io/uk/InstructionEng.2.pdf

  or here:

  There are also some additional information there about the changes in the 0.6.0.0 version.

  Since the 0.6.0.0 version there are made several significant changes.
  Changed the command line arguments modifiers notation to the small letters,
  removed the double ++ sign (changed to just single +) to simplify the command line arguments usage.
  Also changed the way to sign the writing to file for the Phonetic.Languages.General.Simple module.
  Added new lines of properties for the (hypothetic) polyrhythmicity handling. Among them
  "c", "s", "t", "u", "v" lines are. Changed the dependencies
  boundaries. Added the possibility to 'grow lines' to Phonetic.Languages.General.Lines and
  Phonetic.Languages.General.GetTextualInfo modules.

  Since the 0.7.0.0 version the "c", "s", "t", "u" and "v" series can have negative (by sign) result of the
  properties. This does not influence the general behavior of the functions.

  Since the 0.8.0.0 version there are also new "weighted" properties lines used.

  Since the 0.9.0.0 version there are also recursive interactive mode of the
  Phonetic.Languages.General.Simple module functions.
