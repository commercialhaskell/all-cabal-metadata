description: |-
  Phooey is a library for functional UIs, providing three different
  functional interfaces: Monad, Applicative, and Arrow.  See the
  correspondingly named modules in the list below.  The other modules are
  exposed for extensibility.

  Try out the examples in @src\/Examples\/@.

  Because this library uses reactive, compile apps with @-threaded@.

  source code and to wiki pages where you can read and contribute /user
  comments/.  Enjoy!
