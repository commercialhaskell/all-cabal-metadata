changelog: "# Revision history for phonetic-languages-simplified-generalized-examples-common\n\n##
  0.1.0.0 -- 2021-05-05\n\n* First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n##
  0.1.0.1 -- 2021-05-07\n\n* First version revised A. Changed the dependency boundaries
  of the phonetic-languages-phonetics-basics.\n\n## 0.1.1.0 -- 2021-05-10\n\n* First
  version revised B. Some documentation improvements. Changed the dependency boundaries.\n\n##
  0.1.2.0 -- 2021-05-19\n\n* First version revised C. Changed the dependency boundaries
  of the phonetic-languages-phonetics-basics.\n\n## 0.2.0.0 -- 2021-06-04\n\n* Second
  version. Changed the boundaries for the breaking changes of the phonetic-languages-phonetics-basics
  package.\n\n## 0.2.1.0 -- 2021-08-31\n\n* Second version revised A. Some code improvements.
  Updated the dependency boundaries\nand removed the subG as a dependency as it is
  now not needed.\n\n## 0.3.0.0 -- 2021-10-09\n\n* Third version. Added two parameterized
  functions fLinesN and fLinesNIO that allow also to specify the maximum number of\nwords
  in every line.\n\n## 0.4.0.0 -- 2022-02-09\n\n* Fourth version. Fixed the long existing
  issues with not working prepending needed concatenations for the text in the\nmodule
  Data.Phonetic.Languages.PrepareText from the dependency of phonetic-languages-phonetics-basics
  package\nrelated functionality. Added also the possibility to not only prepend needed
  words, but also append.\nThis introduces breaking changes, so please, wait for update
  for all the dependent packages before starting the upgrade, also\ncheck the code
  that uses library functions afterwards.\n\n## 0.5.0.0 -- 2022-08-09\n\n* Fifth version.
  Added phonetic-languages-simplified-generalized-properties-array as a \ndependency.
  Updated the code in the Phonetic.Languages.General.DeEnCoding module\nto support
  the 10 words long lines in the reduced set of permuations mode. Switched to the\nnew
  model of computations which supports two modes instead of just one -- PhoPaaW and
  SaaW.\nSome code improvements.\n\n## 0.5.1.0 -- 2022-09-13\n\n* Fifth version revised
  A. Updated the dependencies to use the new functionality.\n\n## 0.6.0.0 -- 2023-03-05\n\n*

  boundaries to \nsupport the new functionality.\n\n"
