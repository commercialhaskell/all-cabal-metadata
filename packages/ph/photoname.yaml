  4.1 (2019-03-30)

    * Removed some AppImage desktop file categories


  4.0 (2019-03-26)

    * All imports are now explicit
    * Added tests for several missing cases
    * Removed --old-style switch and behavior
    * Removed unnecessary Control.Applicative imports

    * Moved copyright up to 2019
    * Redesign source code directory layout
    * Removed outdated TODO.md and doc/dev/notes files
    * Updated build to use hpack and hsinstall


  3.4 (2018-10-09)

    * Added a new --version switch
    * Now supporting building to an AppImage
    * Moved copyright up to 2018


  3.3 (2017-12-27)

    * A variety of build-related fixes were made


  3.2 (2016-10-02)

    * Switched the build from cabal to stack
    * Added hsinstall installation script
    * Update copyright year
    * Various updates to the cabal file


  3.1 (2015-06-28)

    * Removed ambiguous import of `System.Locale.defaultTimeLocale`
    * Updated to use `Data.Version` to fish the version out of cabal info
    * Replaced deprecated ErrorT with ExceptT
    * Added pragma for Control.Applicative import
    * Updated README and cabal file with current info
    * Moved copyright year up to 2015


  3.0.1 (2012-11-01)

    * Updated test suite to build cleanly (without warnings) and
      run against modern cabal versions
    * Updated cabal file to modern cabal standards. Unit testing is
      now cabal-driven and we now fully support cabal sdist.
    * Fixed a problem where try is no longer available. Now importing
      Control.Exception to bring it into scope.
    * Adjusted usage to explain a change in how we find the EXIF
      date stamps
    * Moved copyright year up to 2012


  3.0.0 (2011-05-08)

    * New naming scheme that uses date/time only, no serial. This
      is a BIG change but the old naming scheme is still available.
    * Parent directory is now a switch
    * Subdirectory path creation of year and day can be suppressed
    * User can specify an arbitrary suffix string for the new names
    * User can now put switches into a config file


  2.3.0 (2010-01-25)

    * Problem fixed that had recently come up with the Exif
      library. Specifically, files with no EXIF data were causing
      an IO error to be thrown and processing to halt. (thanks to
      Josh Hoyt)
    * Other minor updates to things like copyright info and version
      number


  2.2 (2009-06-07)

    * No changes in how the software behaves
    * Updated build-depends to be explicit about base version
      requirement
    * Minor update to BSD3 copyright notices to bring them up to 2009
    * Debian binary package of v2.2 available


  2.1 (2008-10-11)

    * More big changes to the transformers used. No longer using
      WriterT. Now using ErrorT for error handling.
    * Changed to record-style data for the arg parsing.


  2.0 (2008-03-05)

    * Upgraded to build under GHC 6.8.2
    * Major internal changes. Now using ReaderT and WriterT
    * Changed version numbering scheme to be more conventional. Recent
      versions of cabal were not amused with the strange version
      string.
    * This project now added to HackageDB


  003 (2007-09-13)

    * Repairs for a build problem with GHC > 6.6 specifically related
      to depending on FilePath instead of filepath and now requiring
      import of Data.Time.Format


  002 (2007-04-28)

  # photoname


  ## Synopsis

  Rename photo image files based on EXIF shoot date (Haskell)


  ## Description

  photoname is a command-line utility for renaming/moving photo image
  files. The new folder location and naming are determined by the
  photo shoot date information contained within the file's EXIF tags.


  ## Getting binaries

  photoname is available for Linux in AppImage form [from github](https://github.com/dino-/photoname/releases)


  ## Getting source

  - Get the source with git: `$ git clone https://github.com/dino-/photoname.git`
  - Download the cabalized source package [from Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/photoname)

  And once you have it, building the usual way:

      $ stack build
      $ stack run
      $ stack test
      $ stack clean

  If you're just looking, [browse the source](https://github.com/dino-/photoname)


  ## Building for release

  For Linux builds, I recommend using the excellent
  [hsinstall](https://github.com/dino-/hsinstall) utility which will simplify
  creation of an [AppImage](https://appimage.org/) executable.
