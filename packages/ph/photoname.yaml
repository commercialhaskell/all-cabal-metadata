    * A variety of build-related fixes were made


  3.2 (2016-10-02)

    * Switched the build from cabal to stack
    * Added hsinstall installation script
    * Update copyright year
    * Various updates to the cabal file

  3.0.1 (2012-11-01)

    * Updated test suite to build cleanly (without warnings) and

  2.0 (2008-03-05)

    * Upgraded to build under GHC 6.8.2
    * Major internal changes. Now using ReaderT and WriterT
    * Changed version numbering scheme to be more conventional. Recent
      versions of cabal were not amused with the strange version
      string.
    * This project now added to HackageDB


  003 (2007-09-13)

    * Repairs for a build problem with GHC > 6.6 specifically related

  # photoname


  ## Synopsis

  Rename photo image files based on EXIF shoot date (Haskell)


  ## Description

  photoname is a command-line utility for renaming/moving photo image
  files. The new folder location and naming are determined by the
  photo shoot date information contained within the file's EXIF tags.


  ## Getting binaries

  photoname is available for Linux in AppImage form [from github](https://github.com/dino-/photoname/releases)


  ## Getting source

  - Get the source with git: `$ git clone https://github.com/dino-/photoname.git`
  - Download the cabalized source package [from Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/photoname)

  And once you have it, building the usual way:

      $ stack build
      $ stack test --ta all
      $ stack run

  If you're just looking, [browse the source](https://github.com/dino-/photoname)


  ## Building for release

  For Linux builds, I recommend using the excellent
  [hsinstall](https://github.com/dino-/hsinstall) utility which will simplify
  creation of an [AppImage](https://appimage.org/) executable.
