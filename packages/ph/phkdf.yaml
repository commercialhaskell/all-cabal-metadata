  # Revision history for phkdf

  ## Version 0.0.0.0 (2024-03-21)

  *  The definition of Crypto.PHKDF.Primitives is quite stable.

  *  Note that Crypto.PHKDF is intended to be more of a cookbook demonstrating
     how to use and understand PHKDF than anything intended to be deployed.
     The definition and results, and possibly the interface of phkdfSimple and
     phkdfHardened will be completely revamped for Version 0.1

description: |-
  Inspired by PBKDF2, HKDF, and TupleHash. Uses HMAC-SHA256 as a primitive.
  This is primarily intended to be a highly reliable reference implementation
  for the underlying PHKDF primitives. It also aspires to be production
  ready-ish. The main limitation is that it implemented without mutation,
  meaning that potentially sensitive secrets persist in memory longer than
  necessary.
