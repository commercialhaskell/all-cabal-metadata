  # Revision history for phonetic-languages-ukrainian-array

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2020-12-31

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2021-07-24

  * Second version. Added two new functions to 'grow' the lines to the needed value. Some code improvements.

  ## 0.2.1.0 -- 2021-07-24

  * Second version revised A. Changed the prepareGrowTextN function (and renamed it to prepareGrowTextMN) so that it
  has some additional meaning.

  ## 0.3.0.0 -- 2021-08-30

  * Third version. Added new variants of the concatenations. Some code improvements. Fixed several issues with
  consequently going complex words and a prepositions (not very common but actually usable and possible variant).
  Added some improvements to deal with some rare cases.

  ## 0.3.1.0 -- 2021-08-30

  * Third version revised A. Fixed issue with the getBFstL' used with repeated by the first element in the tuples list.

  ## 0.4.0.0 -- 2021-09-01

  * Fourth version. Moved from the phonetic-languages-plus the Ukrainian concatenations reversing functionality.
  Added for this also a code for the executable unconcatUkr.

  ## 0.5.0.0 -- 2021-09-02

  * Fifth version. Added more reverse concatenations variants to the module Ukrainian.ReverseConcatenations.
  Introduced additional first argument to specify whether to use just almost 'safe' reverse concatenations (the
  default one) or also some 'risky' ones where you can obtain splitted normal words.

  ## 0.6.0.0 -- 2021-09-04

  * Sixth version. Added new 'tuned' functions. Exported now also the isUkrainianL function.
