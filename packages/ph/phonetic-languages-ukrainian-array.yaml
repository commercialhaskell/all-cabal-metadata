changelog: "# Revision history for phonetic-languages-ukrainian-array\n\n## 0.1.0.0
  -- 2020-12-31\n\n* First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n## 0.2.0.0
  -- 2021-07-24\n\n* Second version. Added two new functions to 'grow' the lines to
  the needed value. Some code improvements.\n\n## 0.2.1.0 -- 2021-07-24\n\n* Second
  version revised A. Changed the prepareGrowTextN function (and renamed it to prepareGrowTextMN)
  so that it\nhas some additional meaning.\n\n## 0.3.0.0 -- 2021-08-30\n\n* Third
  version. Added new variants of the concatenations. Some code improvements. Fixed
  several issues with\nconsequently going complex words and a prepositions (not very
  common but actually usable and possible variant).\nAdded some improvements to deal
  with some rare cases.\n\n## 0.3.1.0 -- 2021-08-30\n\n* Third version revised A.
  Fixed issue with the getBFstL' used with repeated by the first element in the tuples
  list.\n\n## 0.4.0.0 -- 2021-09-01\n\n* Fourth version. Moved from the phonetic-languages-plus
  the Ukrainian concatenations reversing functionality.\nAdded for this also a code
  for the executable unconcatUkr.\n\n## 0.5.0.0 -- 2021-09-02\n\n* Fifth version.
  Added more reverse concatenations variants to the module Ukrainian.ReverseConcatenations.\nIntroduced
  additional first argument to specify whether to use just almost 'safe' reverse concatenations
  (the\ndefault one) or also some 'risky' ones where you can obtain splitted normal
  words.\n\n## 0.6.0.0 -- 2021-09-04\n\n* Sixth version. Added new 'tuned' functions.
  Exported now also the isUkrainianL function.\n\n## 0.6.1.0 -- 2021-09-09\n\n* Sixth
  version revised A. Fixed issue with language pragma of BangPatterns extension.\n\n##
  0.7.0.0 -- 2021-10-30\n\n* Seventh version. Switched to the Case.Hashable.Cuckoo.getBFstL'
  function where possible. Updated the\ndependencies appropriately.\n\n## 0.8.0.0
  -- 2021-10-31\n\n* Eigth version. Switched back to the CaseBi.Arr.getBFstLSorted'
  functionality.\n\n## 0.8.1.0 -- 2022-01-13\n\n* Eigth version revised A. Changed
  the behaviour of the participles \"б\" / \"ж\" so that now they by default are appended
  to the\nprevious word, if any. Added for this a new function participleConc.\n\n##
  0.8.2.0 -- 2022-01-13\n\n* Eigth version revised B. Fixed issue with just partially
  defined participleConc function.\n\n## 0.9.0.0 -- 2022-01-14\n\n* Ninth version.
  Changed the behaviour of many functions in case of sequences of official parts of
  language like participles,\nprepositions etc, so that they are concatenated together
  with the next word. This is not always suitable, but is sensible\nin many cases
  and allows to preserve more meaning.\n\n## 0.9.1.0 -- 2022-01-14\n\n* Ninth version
  revised A. Taken into account some more complex participle usage situations, though
  still not all possible.\nSome rather uncommon (rarely used) options are still not
  properly converted.\n\n## 0.9.2.0 -- 2022-01-29\n\n* Ninth version revised B. Fixed
  issue with participles \"ж / би\" and their variants. \n\n## 0.9.3.0 -- 2022-03-24\n\n*
  Ninth version revised C. Updated the dependencies boundaries to support the latest
  versions of GHC and Cabal.\n\n## 0.10.0.0 -- 2023-02-03\n\n* Tenth version. Switched
  to NoImplicitPrelude extension. Updated the metadata and dependencies boundaries.\n\n##
  0.11.0.0 -- 2023-10-01\n\n* Eleventh version. Added new generalized functions to
  prepare text. Added README.md file. \n\n## 0.12.0.0 -- 2023-11-16\n\n* Twelfth version.
  Changed the prepareTextN2 function so that also '=' is not filtered out.\n\n"

  to support the [Foundation Gastrostars](https://gastrostars.nl).\n\nOn the 01/10/2023
  there are International Music Day and [André's Rieu](https://www.andrerieu.com/en)
  Birthday. So the version 0.11.0.0 is\nadditionally devoted to him as well as to
  the Kok family — [Emma](https://emmakok.nl) and [Enzo](https://enzokok.nl) are amazing
  and fantastic musicians, Vico\nworks with PhilZuid, Sophie sings in the classical
  manner. Nathalie Kok with love to her family and \nappreciation for André's Rieu
  support also celebrates the Day. In Ukraine this day has several \nimportant celebrations
  — Intercession of the Holy Theotokos (Pokrova), Cossacks' Day, Day of Defenders
  of Ukraine (especially relevant during the Russian war against Ukraine).\n\nAll
