  -- 2021-07-24\n\n* Second version. Added two new functions to 'grow' the lines to
  the needed value. Some code improvements.\n\n## 0.2.1.0 -- 2021-07-24\n\n* Second
  version revised A. Changed the prepareGrowTextN function (and renamed it to prepareGrowTextMN)
  so that it\nhas some additional meaning.\n\n## 0.3.0.0 -- 2021-08-30\n\n* Third
  version. Added new variants of the concatenations. Some code improvements. Fixed
  several issues with\nconsequently going complex words and a prepositions (not very

  with some rare cases.\n\n## 0.3.1.0 -- 2021-08-30\n\n* Third version revised A.
  Fixed issue with the getBFstL' used with repeated by the first element in the tuples
  list.\n\n## 0.4.0.0 -- 2021-09-01\n\n* Fourth version. Moved from the phonetic-languages-plus
  the Ukrainian concatenations reversing functionality.\nAdded for this also a code
  for the executable unconcatUkr.\n\n## 0.5.0.0 -- 2021-09-02\n\n* Fifth version.
  Added more reverse concatenations variants to the module Ukrainian.ReverseConcatenations.\nIntroduced
  additional first argument to specify whether to use just almost 'safe' reverse concatenations
  (the\ndefault one) or also some 'risky' ones where you can obtain splitted normal
  words.\n\n## 0.6.0.0 -- 2021-09-04\n\n* Sixth version. Added new 'tuned' functions.
  Exported now also the isUkrainianL function.\n\n## 0.6.1.0 -- 2021-09-09\n\n* Sixth
