  # Revision history for phonetic-languages-constraints

  ## 0.3.0.1 -- 2020-11-12

  * Third version revised A. Fixed incorrect name of the package.

  ## 0.3.1.0 -- 2020-11-12

  * Third version revised B. Changed the names of the modules so that now they are not ambiguous with those analogous ones from the deprecated package phonetic-languages-constaints.

  ## 0.3.2.0 -- 2020-11-12

  * Third version revised C. Fixed issue with inner unneeded sorting and nubbing in the readMaybeEC function.

  * Fourth version. Switched to more general subG functionality using InsertLeft class and instances. Added, therefore, additional dependencies.
