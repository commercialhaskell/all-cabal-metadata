description: ! '# phaser

  A combinator library for incremental multiple pass parsers.


  This library is inspired by the `Text.ParserCombinators.ReadP` module which is part
  of the base package of the Haskell platform, and also by the conduit library. Except
  for `readS_to_p`: most of the functionality of `ReadP` is possible (although fewer
  convenience functions are currently implemented as of version 0.1.0.0).


  Parsers can also be chained à la conduit.


  Finally: this library supports detailed error reporting including the position in
  the file where the parser failed.
