changelog: "# Revision history for phonetic-languages-simplified-properties-array\n\n##
  0.1.0.0 -- 2020-12-31\n\n* First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n##
  0.1.1.0 -- 2021-01-02\n\n* First version revised A. Changed the dependencies.\n\n##
  0.1.2.0 -- 2021-01-27\n\n* First version revised B. Added new properties related
  to the new durations-related functionality in the ukrainian-phonetics-basic-array-0.1.2.0
  package.\n\n## 0.2.0.0 -- 2021-02-01\n\n* Second version. Added new properties (\"z\"-line)
  to the modules. Some code generalization.\n\n## 0.3.0.0 -- 2021-07-20\n\n* Third
  version. Added new properties (\"x\"-line and \"w\"-line) to the module Phonetic.Languages.Array.Ukrainian.PropertiesSyllablesG2.\nChanged
  the dependency boundaries for phonetic-languages-rhythmicity.\n\n## 0.4.0.0 -- 2021-07-28\n\n*
  Fourth version. Added new properties (\"c\"-, \"u\"-, \"v\"-, \"s\"- and \"t\"-lines)
  to the module Phonetic.Languages.Array.Ukrainian.PropertiesSyllablesG2.\nChanged
  the dependency boundaries for phonetic-languages-rhythmicity.\n\n## 0.4.1.0 -- 2021-07-30\n\n*
  Fourth version revised A. Fixed issues with the fixed point of 1.0 (arising from
  the issue in the dependency package\nphonetic-languages-rhythmicity).\n\n## 0.4.2.0
  -- 2021-07-31\n\n* Fourth version revised B. Some code improvements (reduced duplication).
  Fixed inverse order of the '0' and\nnot '0' functions.\n\n## 0.5.0.0 -- 2021-08-09\n\n*
  Fifth version. Changed the behavior for the new recent properties added so that
  they are now more linearized.\nChanged the dependency boundaries for the package
  phonetic-languages-rhythmicity.\n\n## 0.6.0.0 -- 2021-08-14\n\n* Sixth version.
  Added new properties lines of \"C\", \"N\", \"W\", \"X\", \"Y\", \"Z\" and updated
  some previous ones to\nuse the possibilities of the weighted improtance of lines
  (just some experimental functions at the moment).\nChanged the dependency boundaries
  of phonetic-languages-rhythmicity.\n\n## 0.7.0.0 -- 2021-08-16\n\n* Seventh version.
  Some code improvements. Added also the properties with weighted functions that try
  to increase\nthe importance of the line ending and to decrease the importance of
  the beginnings.\n\n## 0.8.0.0 -- 2021-08-17\n\n* Eigth version. Fixed issues with
  wrong mapping. Some code improvements. Added also the properties with linear\nweighted
  functions.\n\n## 0.8.1.0 -- 2021-08-24\n\n* Eigth version revised A. Switched to
  the new version of the phonetic-languages-rhythmicity that fixed the issues with\ncustom
  user defined new polyrhythmicity choices.\n\n## 0.9.0.0 -- 2021-09-18\n\n* Ninth
  version. Added the new functions that allows the user to define and use his / her
  own syllableDurationsD\nfunctions. They are used with the properties encoding string
  starting with \"H\".\n\n## 0.9.1.0 -- 2021-10-04\n\n* Ninth version revised A. Some
  code improvements.\n\n## 0.9.2.0 -- 2021-10-04\n\n* Ninth version revised B. Changed
  the dependency boundaries and some documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.10.0.0 --
  2021-10-30\n\n* Tenth version. Switched to the Case.Hashable.Cuckoo.getBFstL' function
  where possible. Updated the dependencies boundaries.\n\n## 0.11.0.0 -- 2021-10-31\n\n*
  Eleventh version. Switched back to the CaseBi.Arr.getBFstLSorted' function.\n\n##
  0.12.0.0 -- 2021-11-04\n\n* Twelth version. Switched to the Int8 representation.
  Updated the dependencies accordingly. Splitted the two main modules into\nseveral
  ones with the similar name and some suffix. Made the main modules just reimporting
  the new ones.\n\n## 0.12.1.0 -- 2022-01-16\n\n* Twelth version revised A. Updated
  the dependency boundaries of the for just easier update of the dependent packages.\n\n##
  0.12.2.0 -- 2022-01-17\n\n* Twelth version revised B. Updated the dependency boundaries
  of the for just easier update of the dependent packages.\n\n## 0.13.0.0 -- 2022-02-21\n\n*
  Thirteenth version. Added extended functionality. Changed the versioning policy.\n\n##
  0.13.1.0 -- 2022-03-24\n\n* Thirteenth version revised A. Updated  the dependencies
  boundaries to support the latest GHC  and Cabal.\n\n## 0.14.0.0 -- 2022-05-31\n\n*
  Fourteenth version. Changed the dependencies so that the development is simplified.
  Moved the\nversions of functions without extended usage of the optimization tuples
  to the other new \npackage phonetic-languages-simplified-properties-old.\n\n"
