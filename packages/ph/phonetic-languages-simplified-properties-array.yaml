  # Revision history for phonetic-languages-simplified-properties-array

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2020-12-31

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  ## 0.1.1.0 -- 2021-01-02

  * First version revised A. Changed the dependencies.

  ## 0.1.2.0 -- 2021-01-27

  * First version revised B. Added new properties related to the new durations-related functionality in the ukrainian-phonetics-basic-array-0.1.2.0 package.

  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2021-02-01

  * Second version. Added new properties ("z"-line) to the modules. Some code generalization.

  ## 0.3.0.0 -- 2021-07-20

  * Third version. Added new properties ("x"-line and "w"-line) to the module Phonetic.Languages.Array.Ukrainian.PropertiesSyllablesG2.
  Changed the dependency boundaries for phonetic-languages-rhythmicity.

  ## 0.4.0.0 -- 2021-07-28

  * Fourth version. Added new properties ("c"-, "u"-, "v"-, "s"- and "t"-lines) to the module Phonetic.Languages.Array.Ukrainian.PropertiesSyllablesG2.
  Changed the dependency boundaries for phonetic-languages-rhythmicity.

  ## 0.4.1.0 -- 2021-07-30

  * Fourth version revised A. Fixed issues with the fixed point of 1.0 (arising from the issue in the dependency package
  phonetic-languages-rhythmicity).

  ## 0.4.2.0 -- 2021-07-31

  * Fourth version revised B. Some code improvements (reduced duplication). Fixed inverse order of the '0' and
  not '0' functions.

  ## 0.5.0.0 -- 2021-08-09

  * Fifth version. Changed the behavior for the new recent properties added so that they are now more linearized.
  Changed the dependency boundaries for the package phonetic-languages-rhythmicity.

  ## 0.6.0.0 -- 2021-08-14

  * Sixth version. Added new properties lines of "C", "N", "W", "X", "Y", "Z" and updated some previous ones to
  use the possibilities of the weighted improtance of lines (just some experimental functions at the moment).
  Changed the dependency boundaries of phonetic-languages-rhythmicity.

  ## 0.7.0.0 -- 2021-08-16

  * Seventh version. Some code improvements. Added also the properties with weighted functions that try to increase
  the importance of the line ending and to decrease the importance of the beginnings.

  ## 0.8.0.0 -- 2021-08-17

  * Eigth version. Fixed issues with wrong mapping. Some code improvements. Added also the properties with linear
  weighted functions.

  ## 0.8.1.0 -- 2021-08-24

  * Eigth version revised A. Switched to the new version of the phonetic-languages-rhythmicity that fixed the issues with
  custom user defined new polyrhythmicity choices.

  ## 0.9.0.0 -- 2021-09-18

  * Ninth version. Added the new functions that allows the user to define and use his / her own syllableDurationsD
  functions. They are used with the properties encoding string starting with "H".

  ## 0.9.1.0 -- 2021-10-04

  * Ninth version revised A. Some code improvements.

  ## 0.9.2.0 -- 2021-10-04

  * Ninth version revised B. Changed the dependency boundaries and some documentation improvements.

  ## 0.10.0.0 -- 2021-10-30

  * Tenth version. Switched to the Case.Hashable.Cuckoo.getBFstL' function where possible. Updated the dependencies boundaries.

  ## 0.11.0.0 -- 2021-10-31

  * Eleventh version. Switched back to the CaseBi.Arr.getBFstLSorted' function.

  ## 0.12.0.0 -- 2021-11-04

  * Twelth version. Switched to the Int8 representation. Updated the dependencies accordingly. Splitted the two main modules into
  several ones with the similar name and some suffix. Made the main modules just reimporting the new ones.
