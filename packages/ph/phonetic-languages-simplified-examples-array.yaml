changelog: "# Revision history for phonetic-languages-simplified-examples-array\n\n##
  0.1.0.0 -- 2021-01-02\n\n* First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n##
  0.1.1.0 -- 2021-01-02\n\n* First version revised A. Partially removed the unneeded
  dependency of mmsyn2.\n\n## 0.1.2.0 -- 2021-01-02\n\n* First version revised A.
  Removed the unneeded dependency of mmsyn2 (and all the vector-related functionality).\nSome
  cabal file improvements.\n\n## 0.2.0.0 -- 2021-01-04\n\n* Second version. Added
  a comparative mode to the possibilities of the rewritePoemG3 and the Phonetic.Languages.Lines\n
  module. Some documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.2.1.0 -- 2021-01-06\n\n* Second
  version revised A. Added examples (in English) to the README.md file.\n\n## 0.2.2.0
  -- 2021-01-20\n\n* Second version revised B. Removed the unneeded hidden dependencies
  of the vector related packages and functionality (that was\nannounced in the 0.1.2.0
  version). Fully switched to the GHC.Arr arrays where needed.\n\n## 0.3.0.0 -- 2021-01-28\n\n*
  Third version. The package has the multiple variations mode for lineVariantsG3 executable
  that allows to use modifications in the text, e. g. synonyms, paraphrases etc. Added
  more variants of the properties based on the new dataset for\nr-glpk-phonetic-languages-ukrainian-durations
  package. Added a new module Phonetic.Languages.Parsing for the new functionality.
  Removed unneeded print-info dependency.\n\n## 0.4.0.0 -- 2021-02-01\n\n* Fourth
  version. Added new line of rhythmicity evaluation functions (\"z\"-line). The behaviour
  of the previous functions also\nchanged, so it may be needed (in case where the
  results have some principal meaning, e. g. in scientific research,\nnot the text
  itself) to recalculate the results using these functions. Added the possibility
  to get the Ukrainian\ninformational messages during the work of the lineVariantsG3
  executable (using the \"+U\" command line option not inside\nthe groups of options).
  Some documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.4.0.1 -- 2021-04-17\n\n* Fourth version
  revised A. Fixed some issues with README.md file. Updated the dependency boundaries
  for mmsyn2-array package.\n\n## 0.4.1.0 -- 2021-04-19\n\n* Fourth version revised
  B. Updated the Ukrainian documentation fixing some text issues. See README.md.\n\n##
  0.4.2.0 -- 2021-05-31\n\n* Fourth version revised C. Added an English brief instructions
  to the package.\n\n## 0.5.0.0 -- 2021-07-20\n\n* Fifth version. Added two new lines
  (\"w\" and \"x\" lines) as a new properties evaluation strategies. Updated the dependencies\nboundaries
  accordingly.\n\n## 0.5.0.1 -- 2021-07-21\n\n* Fifth version revised A. Changed the
  README.md file to the just README to fix the display of the command\nline examples
  in it.\n\n## 0.6.0.0 -- 2021-07-28\n\n* Sixth version. Changed the command line
  arguments modifiers notation to the small letters,\nremoved the double ++ sign (changed
  to just single +) to simplify the command line arguments usage.\nAlso changed the
  way to sign the writing to file for the lineVariantsG3 executable. Added new lines
  of\nproperties for the (hypothetic) polyrhythmicity handling. Among them \"c\",
  \"s\", \"t\", \"u\", \"v\" lines are.\nChanged the documentation appropriately.
  Changed the dependencies boundaries. Added the possibility to\n'grow lines' for
  the rewritePoemG3 and propertiesTextG3 executables.\n\n## 0.6.1.0 -- 2021-07-30\n\nSixth
  version revised A. Fixed issues with the fixed point of 1.0 (arising from the issue
  in the dependency package\nphonetic-languages-rhythmicity).\n\n\n## 0.6.2.0 -- 2021-07-31\n\n*
  Sixth version revised B. Changed the dependency boundaries so that the issues are
  fixed with '0' and not '0' functions.\nSome code improvements (reduced duplication).\n\n##
  0.7.0.0 -- 2021-08-09\n\n* Seventh version. Changed the dependency boundaries so
  that now \"c\", \"s\", \"t\", \"u\", and \"v\" series of properties\ncan be negative
  by sign. This does not change the logics of the working programs and functions.
  Some documentation\nimprovements.\n\n## 0.8.0.0 -- 2021-08-14\n\n* Eigth version.
  Changed the dependency boundaries and added new weighted properties and fixed some
  issues with\nthe previous ones so that they use more complete information. Added
  the handler for the case of the empty line for\nthe lineVariantsG3 executable and
  related functionality. Some documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.8.1.0 -- 2021-08-15\n\n*
  Eigth version revised A. Fixed issue with the wrong order and, therefore, mapping
  for different choices and\nthe corresponding properties in the module Phonetic.Languages.Simplified.Array.Ukrainian.FuncRep2RelatedG2.\n\n##
  0.9.0.0 -- 2021-08-16\n\n* Ninth version. Added new properties that try to increase
  the importance of the ending of the line and decrease\nthe importance of the beginning
  of the line. Added new dependency of string-interpreter. Added the possibility\nto
  run lineVariantsG3 and the corresponding library functions in the recursive interactive
  mode. It is not\ncompatible with the contstraints so should be used not simultaneously
  with them (because they change their meaning).\nSome documentation improvements.\n\n##
  0.10.0.0 -- 2021-08-17\n\n* The tenth version. Added new linear weighted properties.
  Fixed some issues with wrong mapping. Some documentation\nimprovements.\n\n## 0.10.1.0
  -- 2021-08-24\n\n* The tenth version revised. Fixed issues with the custom user
  defined polyrhythmicity patterns. Changed the\ndocumentation instructions in editor.
  Updated the dependency boundaries accordingly.\n\n## 0.11.0.0 -- 2021-09-04\n\n*
  The eleventh version. Added new mode of multiple sources processment (+t_ ... -t).
  Added the possibility to\ncount in the recursive mode not just from the beginning
  of the word concatenation but also from the end using\nthe commonly used programming
  pattern of the negative integer indexing. Updated the dependencies so that now\nit
  can use multiple improvements of the dependencies. Some documentation improvements.\n\n##
  0.11.0.1 -- 2021-09-06\n\n* The eleventh version revised A. Fixed issue with documentation
  (README) file.\n\n## 0.11.1.0 -- 2021-09-08\n\n* The eleventh version revised B.
  Fixed issue with the phonetic-languages-plus dependency being not built. Updated\nthe
  dependency boundaries.\n\n## 0.11.2.0 -- 2021-09-09\n\n* The eleventh version revised
  C. Fixed issue with the phonetic-languages-ukrainian-array dependency being not\nbuilt.
  Updated the dependency boundaries. Updated the README file with the hyperlinks to
  the updated documentation\nrelated to the usage of the package.\n\n## 0.11.3.0 --
  2021-09-09\n\n* The eleventh version revised D. Updated the README file with the
  hyperlinks to the updated documentation\nrelated to the usage of the package.\n\n##
  0.12.0.0 -- 2021-09-14\n\n* The twelth version. Added multiple properties mode to
  the rewritePoemG3 program and extended the comparative mode\nfor it up to 7 different
  input source files. Some documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.12.1.0 -- 2021-09-15\n\n*
  The twelth version revised A. Fixed issues in the documentation for the installation
  and upgrading processes.\n\n## 0.13.0.0 -- 2021-10-14\n\n* The thirteenth version.
  Added the possibility to provide the user-defined (read from the file with Haskell-like\nsyntaxis)
  functions to define the syllable durations. Added also the possibility to use just
  pairwise permutations\ninstead of the full universal set of them. Updated the dependency
  boundaries and the documentation\nappropriately. Fixed the issue with not properly
  documented (re-)installation process for the package(s).\n\n## 0.13.1.0 -- 2021-10-23\n\n*
  The thirteenth version revised A. Imlemented pairwise permutations mode more deeply.
  Some documentation improvements.\nUpdated the dependencies boundaries.\n\n## 0.14.0.0
  -- 2021-10-31\n\n* The fourteenth version. Fixed the not very sufficient release
  candidate that used hashing functionality. If you have not\nupgraded to the hashing
  functionality during the 2021-10-30--2021-10-31 you do not need to upgrade either.\n\n##
  0.14.1.0 -- 2021-11-01\n\n* The fourteenth version revised A. Fixed issues with
  doubling the input command line arguments to some extent.\n\n## 0.15.0.0 -- 2021-11-05\n\n*

  improvements.\n\n## 0.15.1.0 -- 2021-11-08\n\n* The fifteenth version revised A.
  Some documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.15.2.0 -- 2021-12-10\n\n* The fifteenth
  version revised B. Some documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.15.2.1 -- 2021-12-11\n\n*
  The fifteenth version revised C. Some documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.15.2.2
  -- 2021-12-26\n\n* The fifteenth version revised D. Some documentation improvements.
  If you updated at least to  the 0.15.0.0\nversion there is no need to reinstall
  the package, just check the new update for the documentation (see README links).\nThe
  instructions are intended to follow the strict scientific approach to the sources
  so the popular information moved to the\ndirect hyperlinked citations, not into
  the Bibliography.\n\n## 0.16.0.0 -- 2022-01-17\n\n* The sixteenth version. Added
  cli-arguments as a new dependency. Changed the way the programs parse their arguments.\nAdded
  the possibility to use also minimal set of permutations (just one word). Updated
  the dependencies. Some code\nimprovements. Updated the documentation with the new
  material and fixed obsoleted output examples.\n\n## 0.16.1.0 -- 2022-01-17\n\n*
  The sixteenth version revised A. Fixed issue with the unneeded import declaration
  of the moved functionality.\n\n## 0.16.2.0 -- 2022-01-18\n\n* The sixteenth version
  revised B. Added information about the suggested package html-presentation-text
  to the\npackage description.\n\n## 0.16.2.1 -- 2022-01-18\n\n* The sixteenth version
  revised C. Tried to fix an issue with incorrectly displayed http address.\n\n##
  0.16.2.2 -- 2022-01-18\n\n* The sixteenth version revised D. Fixed the issue with
  incorrectly displayed http address.\n\n## 0.16.3.0 -- 2022-01-29\n\n* The sixteenth
  version revised E. Updated the dependencies so that the new behaviour of the phonetic-languages-ukrainian-array\ntakes
  its place.\n\n## 0.17.0.0 -- 2022-02-22\n\n* The seventeenth version. Switched to
  the extended versions that should optimize code more in speed. Updated the\ndocumentation.
  Added a new dependency of mmsyn2-array-ukrainian-data.\n\n## 0.17.1.0 -- 2022-03-24\n\n*
  The seventeenth version revised A. Updated the dependencies to support the latest
  versions of GHC and Cabal.\n\n## 0.18.0.0 -- 2022-04-25\n\n* The eighteenth version.
  In the new version there were fixed issues with changing the structure of output
  (intervals rearrangements)\nso that the programs now work as\ndescribed. If you
  used earlier changing structure with the arguments then all the results must be
  re-considered (re-done)\nwith fixed version 0.18.0.0.\nThe author ask for pardon
  because of such longlasted issue.\nImproved documentation.\nAdded examples of two
  new sets of values of durations that are available as the ready-to-use file (see
  link in the\ninstructions or in README.md).\nFixed issues with string interpreter
  (see the appropriate information) and added the possibility to adjust splitting.\n\n##
  0.18.0.1 -- 2022-04-25\n\n* The eighteenth version revised A. Tried to fix the README.md
  so no {=html} is present in the visual output.\n\n## 0.18.0.2 -- 2022-04-25\n\n*
  The eighteenth version revised B. Fixed the not included dependencies changes.\n\n##
  0.19.0.0 -- 2022-05-31\n\n* The nineteenth version. The new version adds support
  for additional properties, as well as multiple properties mode for distributionTextG.\nThe
  theoretical part of this document has been improved. Fixed some code bugs. Switched
  in calculations of the\naverage values and standard deviation from population to
  sample versions (now the standard deviation is slightly higher).\nFixed issues with
  multiple variations of the text mode if it is not used interactively.\n\n## 0.20.0.0
  -- 2022-08-09\n\n* The twentieth version. Updated the dependencies so that now the
  Ukrainian syllable segmentation is treated more properly.\nChanged the structure
  of the non-sound Ukraninian symbols representation (now they are converted to one
  of the [100,101,102]).\nSwitched to the new Result2 representation. Added the new
  syllables-as-a-whole functionality \nto deal with e.g. syllabo-tonic verses. Added
  the possibility to print more verbose output\nin the multiple properties mode for
  lineVariantsG3 executable. All these changes lead to\nthe need to recompute the
  values if they are important and not the result. Updated the\ndocumentation with
  the new data.\n\n## 0.20.1.0 --2022-08-22\n\n* The twentieth version revised A.
  Fixed issues with the rearrangements of the intervals. Some documentation improvements.\n\n\n"

  The new version adds support for additional properties, as well as multiple properties mode for distributionTextG.
  The theoretical part of this document has been improved. Fixed some code bugs. Switched in calculations of the
  average values and standard deviation from population to sample versions (now the standard deviation is slightly higher).
  Fixed issues with multiple variations of the text mode if it is not used interactively.

  ).

  Since the version 0.20.0.0 added the second major mode of operation -- SaaW (syllable-as-a-whole),
  additionally to the previous functionality  of PhoPaaW (phonetic-phenomena-as-a-whole).

  For more information, see the instructions.

  Since the version 0.2.0.0 there exists also comparative mode for the
  rewritePoemG3 executable. It allows to create from two files with the
  text variants the new one. For more information in Ukrainian, please,
  refer to the instruction above to the part of the rewritePoemG3
  executable.

  Since the version 0.4.0.0 added new line of rhythmicity evaluation
  functions ("z"-line). The behaviour of the previous functions also
  changed, so it may be needed (in case where the results have some
  principal meaning, e. g. in scientific research, not the text itself) to
  recalculate the results using these functions. Added the possibility to
  get the Ukrainian informational messages during the work of the
  lineVariantsG3 executable (using the "+u" command line option not inside
  the groups of options).

  Since the version 0.5.0.0 added two new lines with more complex
  behaviours ("w" and "x" lines). For more information, please, refer to
  the section 'WX argument' in the instructions above.

  Since the version 0.6.0.0 changed the command line arguments modifiers
  notation to the small letters, removed the double ++ sign (changed to
  just single +) to simplify the command line arguments usage. Also
  changed the way to sign the writing to file for the lineVariantsG3
  executable. Added new lines of properties for the (hypothetic)
  polyrhythmicity handling. Among them "c", "s", "t", "u", "v" lines are.
  Added the possibility to 'grow lines' for the rewritePoemG3 and
  propertiesTextG3 executables.

  Since the version 0.8.0.0 added new weighted properties.

  Since the version 0.13.0.0 added the pairwise permutations mode (with +p
  command line argument) where just pairwise permutations are used and the
  length of the line can be up to 10 words or their concatenations.
  Besides added the possibility to specify your own durations using the +d
  `<path to the file with ordered durations>` command line
  arguments. They are used with H... properties, e. g. Hw04, Hw02, Hx36
  etc.

  -   Examples of usage

  1)  lineVariantsG3:

  lineVariantsG3 `<first argument>` \[`<WX argument>`
  \<whether to print the values of the property(ies)\>
  `<whether the last word must remain on its place>`\]
  `<numeric arguments>` `<property type>`
  `<Ukrainian text>`

  or:

  lineVariantsG3 `<first argument>` \[`<WX argument>`
  \<whether print the values of the property(ies)\>
  `<whether the last word must remain on its place>`\]
  `<numeric arguments>` `<property type>`
  `<Ukrainian text>`
  `<somewhere among the arguments as a single group: constraints>`

  More partucular example of the abovementioned one:

  To get the Ukrainian informational messages during the work of the
  executable (instead of the default English ones), please, use the "+u"
  command line option anywhere not inside the groups of the options.

  For more information, please, refer to the text in the instructions above.

  For example, you can also use multiple variations mode to look at the synonyms,
  paraphrases etc.

  For this, use instead of just the text as the last arguments the
  following special construction:

  { `<variant1 of the Ukrainian text>` /
  `<variant2 of the Ukrainian text>` / ... /
  `<variantN of the Ukrainian text>` }

  with at least two variants inside the curly brackets. They will be
  processed in chain with the one variant of each and the possibility to
  choose at the end between these different ones, which finally results in
  a single line.

  Please, remember that the program provides processing for every
  combination of the variations so if you specify too many of them (e. g.
  3 variants of one word and 4 variants of the another one will lead to
  3\*4 = 12 variations possible), the processing while getting the final
  result can become longer than expected.

  Recursive mode:

  lineVariantsG3 +r

  is incompatible with the constraints (+a ... -a).

  Since the 0.11.0.0 version there is also the most complex mode of
  multiple sources processment or recursive interactive cycle mode. For
  this use +t {two-digits number} ... \^t command line arguments group
  with the two-digits number being one of the following: 20, 21, 30, 31,
  40, 41, 50, 51, 60, 61, 70, 71.

  For example:

  lineVariantsG3 +r 3 w04 +t 71 "sadok.txt" "other\_poem.txt"
  "just\_text.txt" \^t

  2)  propertiesTextG3:

  propertiesTextG3 `<first argument>` \[`<WX argument>`
  `<whether to grow lines>`\] `<file with Ukrainian text>`
  `<control of the quantity of the intervals>` \<control of
  printing the line of the text, too\>
  `<control of the sectioning into the lines>`
  `<property type>`

  propertiesTextG3 `<first argument>` \[`<WX argument>`
  `<whether to grow lines>`\] `<file with Ukrainian text>`
  `<control of the quantity of the intervals>` \<control of
  printing the line of the text, too\>
  `<control of the sectioning into the lines>`
  `<property type>` \| distributionTextG
  `<the same argument of the quantity of the lines>`
  `<whether to output also by-line statistics>`

  PowerShell -Command "propertiesTextG3 `<first argument>`
  \[`<WX argument>` `<whether to grow lines>`\]
  `<file with Ukrainian text>`
  `<control of the quantity of the intervals>` \<control of
  printing the line of the text, too\>
  `<control of the sectioning into the lines>`
  `<property type>` \| distributionTextG
  `<the same argument of the quantity of the lines>`
  `<whether to output also by-line statistics>`"

  Note: Below the +RTS -N --RTS corresponds to the architectures where the
  parallelism is possible so that -N is one of the possible options for
  RTS. If the following with RTS arguments does not work, then remove the
  +RTS -N --RTS block from the command line. One of the examples where RTS
  does not support parallelism of this kind is armhf (e. g. Linux on
  Raspberry PI in 32-bit mode).

  propertiesTextG3 sadok0.txt +RTS -N --RTS s 1 0 +m y0 0y 02z 03y z2 y3
  yy3 -m

  propertiesTextG3 sadok0.txt +RTS -N --RTS s 1 0 03z +b \|
  distributionTextG s 1 +W

  propertiesTextG3 sadok0.txt +RTS -N --RTS s 1 0 03z +g 73 +b \|
  distributionTextG s 1 +W

  propertiesTextG3
  `<filepath to the file with the Ukrainian text for analysis>` @n

  3)  rewritePoemG3:

  rewritePoemG3 `<first argument >`
  \[`<whether to grow lines>`\] `<Ukrainian text file>`\

  Since the 0.9.0.0 version there is a possibility to run lineVariantsG3
  in the recursive mode. It is not compatible with the contstraints so
  should be used not simultaneously with them (because they change their
  meaning).

  Since the 0.13.0.0 version there is the possibility also to provide your
  own functions for the syllable durations. They are read from the file
  with special Haskell-like syntaxis. For more information, please, refer
  to the instructions above.

  Since the 0.16.0.0 version you can use two reduced set of permutations
  modes in addition to the default full universal set of permutations
  mode. To use them, please, add "+p {1 or 2}" to the command line
  arguments. For more information, please, refer to the instructions
  following the links above.

  In the version 0.18.0.0 there were fixes of the issues with interval
  rearrangements and string interpreter. Also improved the documentation
  and added examples of two sets of durations that is available as a
  ready-to-use file by the persistent link:
