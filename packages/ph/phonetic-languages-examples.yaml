changelog: "# Revision history for phonetic-languages-examples\n\n## 0.1.0.0 -- 2020-10-30\n\n*
  First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n## 0.1.1.0 -- 2020-11-06\n\n*
  First version revised A. Changed the dependency boundaries so that the package uses
  the latest versions.\n\n## 0.1.2.0 -- 2020-11-06\n\n* First version revised B. Fixed
  some issues with the text preprocessing so that avoid unconsistency between different
  packages. Some simplification of the code for the\npropertiesTextG executable.\n\n##
  0.2.0.0 -- 2020-11-07\n\n* Second version. Added the possibilities to use new related
  to generated with r-glpk-phonetic-languages-ukrainian-durations package duration
  metrices.\nChanged the dependencies boundaries for this.\n\n## 0.3.0.0 -- 2020-11-09\n\n*
  Third version. Added the possibility to use coefficients' version of the rhythmicity-related
  functions from the phonetic-languages-rhythmicity and\nphonetic-languages-properties
  packages.\n\n## 0.3.1.0 -- 2020-11-09\n\n* Third version revised A. Fixed issue
  with the wrong output option for one of the columns in the propertiesTextG executable
  running output.\n\n## 0.3.1.1 -- 2020-11-09\n\n* Third version revised A. Fixed
  the wrong comment about the first command line argument.\n\n## 0.3.2.0 -- 2020-11-10\n\n*
  Third version revised B. Fixed issue with missing variant for procBothF function
  in the working program. Updated the dependency boundaries of\nthe ukrainian-phonetics-basic.\n\n##
  0.3.3.0 -- 2020-11-10\n\n* Third version revised C. Fixed issue with the reverse
  order of the output for the rewritePoemG executable.\n\n## 0.4.0.0 -- 2020-11-12\n\n*
  Fourth version. Added the possibility to use constraints from the phonetic-languages-constraints
  package (it is also a new leightweight dependency)\nin the lineVariantsG executable.
  They allows to reduce number of computations needed and explicitly apply additional
  needed grammar rules, extend\nthe extent of understandable text and so on.\n\n##
  0.4.1.0 -- 2020-11-12\n\n* Fourth version revised A. Fixed issue with incorrect
  behaviour because of phonetic-languages-constraints inner issue. Changed the dependency
  boundaries appropriately. Changed\nthe behaviour of the lineVariantsG so that you
  can use no coeffs (specially formatted first command line argument), this then is
  like for the versions before 0.3.0.0.\n\n## 0.4.2.0 -- 2020-11-12\n\n* Fourth version
  revised B. Fixed issues with maximumElBy from the phonetic-languages-general package
  by upgrading to the latest version.\n\n## 0.5.0.0 -- 2020-11-13\n\n* Fifth version.
  Added file README.md with the persistent link to the instruction (in Ukrainian)
  how to use the programs of the package.\n\n## 0.6.0.0 -- 2020-11-16\n\n* Sixth version.
  Added the possibility to select the lines for analysis by propertiesTextG and to
  print the analyzed text with line numbers. To print it with\nline numbers use the
  command line argument @n. Afterwards, running again, specify the needed line numbers
  by the first one number and the last one number\nseparated with colon (':'). You
  can specify multiple times. The order would have been the same as you have specified.\n\n##
  0.6.1.0 -- 2020-11-18\n\n* Sixth version revised A. Changed the usage of the maximumElBy
  from the Languages.UniquenessPeriods.Vector.General.DebugG module to the respective
  function from the \nLanguages.UniquenessPeriods.Vector.General.Simplified module
  to reduce computations. Changed the boundaries for the dependency of phonetic-languages-general
  and subG. Please, \nupdate to the version with updating also phonetic-languages-general,
  phonetic-languages-common and subG.\n\n"
