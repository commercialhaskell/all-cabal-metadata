  * Second version. Added the possibilities to use new related to generated with r-glpk-phonetic-languages-ukrainian-durations package duration metrices.
  Changed the dependencies boundaries for this.

  ## 0.3.0.0 -- 2020-11-09

  * Third version. Added the possibility to use coefficients' version of the rhythmicity-related functions from the phonetic-languages-rhythmicity and
  phonetic-languages-properties packages.

  ## 0.3.1.0 -- 2020-11-09

  * Third version revised A. Fixed issue with the wrong output option for one of the columns in the propertiesTextG executable running output.

  ## 0.3.1.1 -- 2020-11-09

  * Third version revised A. Fixed the wrong comment about the first command line argument.

  ## 0.3.2.0 -- 2020-11-10

  the ukrainian-phonetics-basic.

  ## 0.3.3.0 -- 2020-11-10

  * Third version revised C. Fixed issue with the reverse order of the output for the rewritePoemG executable.

  ## 0.4.0.0 -- 2020-11-12

  * Fourth version. Added the possibility to use constraints from the phonetic-languages-constraints package (it is also a new leightweight dependency)
  in the lineVariantsG executable. They allows to reduce number of computations needed and explicitly apply additional needed grammar rules, extend
  the extent of understandable text and so on.
