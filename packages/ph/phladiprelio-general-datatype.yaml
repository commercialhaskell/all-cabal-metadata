  Devotion\n ========\n\nP.S.: the author would like to devote this project to support
  the [Foundation Gastrostars](https://gastrostars.nl).\n\nOn the 2023/09/22 there
  is Nathalie's Kok birthday. She is the mother of the foundation founder [Emma Kok](https://emmakok.nl)
  and the member of the foundation board, so the versions 0.1.0.0, 0.1.1.0, 0.2.0.0,
  0.2.1.0 and 0.2.2.0 (the first, the initial ones) are also dedicated to Nathalie
  Kok.\n\nOn the 01/10/2023 there are International Music Day and [André's Rieu](https://www.andrerieu.com/en)
  Birthday. So the versions 0.3.0.0, 0.3.0.1 and 0.3.1.0 are\nadditionally devoted
  to him as well as to the Kok family — [Emma](https://emmakok.nl) and [Enzo](https://enzokok.nl)
  are amazing and fantastic musicians, Vico\nworks with PhilZuid, Sophie sings in
  the classical manner. Nathalie Kok with love to her family and \nappreciation for
  André's Rieu support also celebrates the Day. In Ukraine this day has several \nimportant
  celebrations — Intercession of the Holy Theotokos (Pokrova), Cossacks' Day, Day
  of Defenders of Ukraine (especially relevant during the Russian war against Ukraine).\n\nAll
  support is welcome, including donations for the needs of the Ukrainian army, IDPs
  and refugees. \n\nIf you would like to share some financial support with the Foundation
