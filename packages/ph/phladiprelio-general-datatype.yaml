  Devotion\n ========\n\nThe author would like to devote this project to support the
  [Foundation Gastrostars](https://gastrostars.nl).\n\nOn the 2023/09/22 there is
  Nathalie's Kok birthday. She is the mother of the foundation founder [Emma Kok](https://emmakok.nl)
  and the member of the foundation board, so the versions 0.1.0.0, 0.1.1.0, 0.2.0.0,
  0.2.1.0 and 0.2.2.0 (the first, the initial ones) are also dedicated to Nathalie
  Kok.\n\nOn the 01/10/2023 there are International Music Day and [André's Rieu](https://www.andrerieu.com/en)
  Birthday. So the versions 0.3.0.0, 0.3.0.1 and 0.3.1.0 are\nadditionally devoted
  to him as well as to the Kok family — [Emma](https://emmakok.nl) and [Enzo](https://enzokok.nl)
  are amazing and fantastic musicians, Vico\nworks with PhilZuid, Sophie sings in
  the classical manner. Nathalie Kok with love to her family and \nappreciation for
  André's Rieu support also celebrates the Day. In Ukraine this day has several \nimportant
  celebrations — Intercession of the Holy Theotokos (Pokrova), Cossacks' Day, Day
  of Defenders of Ukraine (especially relevant during the Russian war against Ukraine).\n\nOn
  the 11/11/2023 there is St. Martin of Tours Day for Roman Catholics.\n\nOn the 06/01/2024
  there was Sophie's Kok, a sister of Emma Kok, 19th Birthday (she is 18). Therefore,
  the version 0.7.0.0 is additionally devoted also to her.\n\nAll support is welcome,
  including donations for the needs of the Ukrainian army, IDPs and refugees. \n\nIf
  you would like to share some financial support with the Foundation Gastrostars,
  please, contact the mentioned foundation\nusing the URL:\n\n[Contact Foundation
