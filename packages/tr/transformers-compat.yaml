synopsis: A small compatibility shim for the transformers library
changelog: |
  0.6.5 [2019.05.11]
  ------------------
  * Ensure that the backported `MonadFail` instance for `ExceptT` is available
    when built against `transformers-0.4.*`.

  0.6.4 [2019.04.01]
  ------------------
  * Use more conservative CPP to guard the backported `MonadFix` instance for
    `ListT`.

  0.6.3 [2019.04.01]
  ------------------
  * Backport changes from `transformers-0.5.6.*`:
    * Backport the `MonadFix` instance for `ListT` in
      `Control.Monad.Trans.Instances`.
    * Generalize the type of `except` in `Control.Monad.Trans.Except`.
  * Backport `MonadFail` instances for `AccumT`, `Reverse`, and `SelectT` on
    pre-8.0 versions of GHC by depending on the `fail` package if necessary.
  * Backport `MonadFail` instances for monad transformer types in
    `Control.Monad.Trans.Instances`.

  0.6.2
  -----
  * `transformers-compat` now uses automatic flags instead of manual ones.
    This has a number of benefits:

    * There is no need for making several simultaneous releases to support each
      flag combination.
    * As a result, the `cabal-install` constraint solver should have a much
      easier time figuring out install-plans involving `transformers-compat`.

    Due to old `cabal-install` bugs, `cabal-install-1.16` and older may have a
    harder time installing this package, so it is recommended that you use
    `cabal-install-1.18` or later. (Or, if you must use `cabal-install-1.16` or
    older, installing `transformers-compat` with the appropriate flags should
    help.)

  0.6.1.6
  -------
  * Each of versions 0.6.1.2–0.6.1.6 is a 0.6.1 build with a different set of flags configured. Building this way allows us to work around bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker. The 0.6.1 release notes describe the changes in this version.
    This release is configured with none of `-ftwo`, `-fthree`, `-ffour`, or `-ffive` (which works with `transformers-0.5.3` and above).

  -------
  * Each of versions 0.6.1.2–0.6.1.6 is a 0.6.1 build with a different set of flags configured. Building this way allows us to work around bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker. The 0.6.1 release notes describe the changes in this version.
    This release is configured with `-ffive` (which works with `transformers-0.5` up until, but not including, `transformers-0.5.3`).

  0.6.1.4
  -------
  * Each of versions 0.6.1.2–0.6.1.6 is a 0.6.1 build with a different set of flags configured. Building this way allows us to work around bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker. The 0.6.1 release notes describe the changes in this version.

    This release is configured with `-ftwo` (which works with the `transformers-0.2` series).

  0.6.1
  -----
  * Fix an oversight in which the `Control.Monad.Trans.Accum` and
    `Control.Monad.Trans.Select` modules were not backported when built with the
    `-ffour` flag.

  0.6.0.6
  -------
  * Each of versions 0.6.0.2–0.6.0.6 is a 0.6 build with a different set of flags configured. Building this way allows us to work around bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker. The 0.6 release notes describe the changes in this version.
    This release is configured with none of `-ftwo`, `-fthree`, `-ffour`, or `-ffive` (which works with `transformers-0.5.3` and above).

  0.6.0.5

    This release is configured with `-ftwo` (which works with the `transformers-0.2` series).

  0.6
  ---
  * Introduce the `Data.Functor.Classes.Generic` module, which provides functions that can generically implement methods in the `Eq1`, `Ord1`, `Read1`, and `Show1` classes (without the usual boilerplate involved).
  * Introduce the `generic-deriving` flag. When enabled, `transformers-compat` will depend on the `generic-deriving` library on older versions of GHC to backport `GHC.Generics` support for `Generic` instances and the machinery in `Data.Functor.Classes.Generic`.
  * Some instances were present in `Data.Functor.Sum` but not in `Control.Monad.Trans.Instances` (e.g., the `Generic`, `Typeable`, and `Data` instances for `Sum`). This has been fixed.
  * Backport changes from `transformers-0.5.5`:
    * Backport the `Semigroup` instance for `Constant`
    * Add `mapSelect` and `mapSelectT`
    * Define `selectToContT` (and deprecate `selectToCont` in favor of that)
    * Define some explicit `(*>)` definitions to avoid space leaks
  * Backport changes from `transformers-0.5.4` (i.e., add `Bifoldable` and `Bitraversable` instances for `Data.Functor.Constant`)
  * Backport changes from `transformers-0.5.3`:
    * Backport the `Control.Monad.Trans.Accum` and `Control.Monad.Trans.Select` modules
    * Backport the `eitherToErrors` and `elimLift` functions to `Control.Applicative.Lift`
    * Backport `Bits`, `FiniteBits`, `IsString`, `Num`, `Real`, `Integral`, `Fractional`, `Floating`, `RealFrac`, and `RealFloat` instances for `Data.Functor.Identity`
    * Backport `Monad`, `MonadFail`, and `MonadPlus` instances for `Data.Functor.Reverse`
    * Backport `Eq1`, `Ord1`, `Read1`, and `Show1` instances for `Data.Proxy`
  * Backport changes from `transformers-0.5.2` (i.e., add more `INLINE` annotations)
  * Backport changes from `transformers-0.5.1` (i.e., add `Bounded`, `Enum`, `Ix`, and `Storable` instances for `Identity`)

  0.5.1.4
  -------
  * Each of versions 0.5.1.2–0.5.1.4 is a 0.5.1 build with a different set of flags configured. Building this way allows us to work around bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker. The 0.5.1 release notes describe the changes in this version.
    This release is configured with neither `-ftwo` nor `-fthree` (which works with `transformers-0.4` and above).

    This release is configured with `-ftwo` (which works with the `transformers-0.2` series).

  0.5.1
  -----
  * Fix a bug in which `PolyKinds` was enabled on GHC 7.4, resulting in interface file bugs on that version of GHC.

  0.5.0.4
  -------
  * Each of versions 0.5.0.2–0.5.0.4 is a 0.5 build with a different set of flags configured. Building this way allows us to work around bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker. The 0.5 release notes describe the changes in this version.

    This release is configured with `-ftwo` (which works with the `transformers-0.2` series).

  0.5
  ---
  * Update `transformers-compat` to incorporate changes from the `transformers-0.5` series. These changes include:
    * The `Data.Functor.Classes` module was completely redesigned.
    * Modules now have `Safe` or `Trustworthy` annotations.
    * Data types and type synonyms are poly-kinded when possible.
  * Add `Control.Monad.Trans.Instances`, a module of orphan instances that mimic instances available in later versions of `transformers`.

  0.4.0.4
  -------
  * Each of versions 0.4.0.2–0.4.0.4 is a 0.4 build with a different set of flags configured. Building this way allows us to work around bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker. The 0.4 release notes describe the changes in this version.

    This release is configured with `-ftwo` (which works with the `transformers-0.2` series).

  0.4
  ---
  * Added support for the missing `ExceptT` instances from `mtl`.

    This was not done lightly. While this means that by default incurring a dependency on `transformers-compat` drags in `mtl` when you are
    using an old `transformers`, it means that users do not have to orphan these instances and permits wider adoption of `ExceptT`.

    If you absolutely can't stand `mtl` and really want this package to build as valid `Haskell98`, then you can use `cabal install transformers-compat -f-mtl` to avoid incurring the dependency to get these instances. However, that is effectively an unsupported configuration.

  0.3.3.4
  -------
  * Versions 0.3.3.2–0.3.3.4 were a successful attempt to fix build problems caused by the cabal backtracker.
  * Each of these is a build with a different set of flags configured.
    This release is configured with neither `-ftwo` nor `-fthree` (which works with `transformers-0.4` and above).

  0.3.3.3
  -------
  * Versions 0.3.3.2–0.3.3.4 were a successful attempt to fix build problems caused by the cabal backtracker.
  * Each of these is a build with a different set of flags configured.
    This release is configured with `-fthree` (which works with the `transformers-0.3` series).

  0.3.3.2
  -------
  * Versions 0.3.3.2–0.3.3.4 were a successful attempt to fix build problems caused by the cabal backtracker.
  * Each of these is a build with a different set of flags configured.
    This release is configured with `-ftwo` (which works with the `transformers-0.2` series).

  0.3.2
  -----
  * This release was a failed (or at least, only partially successful) attempt to fix build problems caused by the cabal backtracker.

  0.3.1
  -----
  * `transformers 0.4.1` compatibility

  0.3
  ---
  * Added the instances for `Data.Functor.Classes` from `transformers 0.4`
  * Switched `Control.Applicative.Backwards` and `Data.Functor.Reverse` to the split constructor/accessor style from `transformers 0.4`.

  0.2
  ---
  * Added the new types and classes from `transformers 0.4`

  0.1.1.1
  -------
  * Wrote a better synopsis

  0.1.1
  -----
  * Updated to trick `cabal` into building an empty `libHStransformers-compat-0.1.a` on GHC 7.6.

  0.1
  ---
  * Repository initialized by pulling the `transformers-0.2` compatibility layer out of `lens`.

  transformers-compat
  ===================

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/transformers-compat.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers-compat) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ekmett/transformers-compat.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ekmett/transformers-compat)

  This provides a thin compatibility shim on top of transformers-0.2 to add the types that were added in transformers-0.3.

  This enables users to maintain haskell-platform compatibility, while still gaining access ot the new functionality.

  Related packages
  ----------------
  The `writer-cps-transformers` package backports the
  `Control.Monad.Trans.{RWS,Writer}.CPS` modules that were introduced in
  `transformers-0.5.6.0`. There are also a variety of companion packages which
  backport orphan instances for these types. One example is `writer-cps-mtl`,
  which backports instances of type classes from the `mtl` library.
