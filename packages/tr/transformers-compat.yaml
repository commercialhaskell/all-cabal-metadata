synopsis: A small compatibility shim for the transformers library
changelog: ! "0.6.2\n-----\n* `transformers-compat` now uses automatic flags instead
  of manual ones.\n  This has a number of benefits:\n\n  * There is no need for making
  several simultaneous releases to support each\n    flag combination.\n  * As a result,
  the `cabal-install` constraint solver should have a much\n    easier time figuring
  out install-plans involving `transformers-compat`.\n\n  Due to old `cabal-install`
  bugs, `cabal-install-1.16` and older may have a\n  harder time installing this package,
  so it is recommended that you use\n  `cabal-install-1.18` or later. (Or, if you
  must use `cabal-install-1.16` or\n  older, installing `transformers-compat` with
  the appropriate flags should\n  help.)\n\n0.6.1.6\n-------\n* Each of versions 0.6.1.2–0.6.1.6
  is a 0.6.1 build with a different set of flags configured. Building this way allows
  us to work around bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker. The 0.6.1 release notes describe
  the changes in this version.\n  This release is configured with none of `-ftwo`,
  `-fthree`, `-ffour`, or `-ffive` (which works with `transformers-0.5.3` and above).\n\n0.6.1.5\n-------\n*
  Each of versions 0.6.1.2–0.6.1.6 is a 0.6.1 build with a different set of flags
  configured. Building this way allows us to work around bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker.
  The 0.6.1 release notes describe the changes in this version.\n  This release is
  configured with `-ffive` (which works with `transformers-0.5` up until, but not
  including, `transformers-0.5.3`).\n\n0.6.1.4\n-------\n* Each of versions 0.6.1.2–0.6.1.6
  is a 0.6.1 build with a different set of flags configured. Building this way allows
  us to work around bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker. The 0.6.1 release notes describe
  the changes in this version.\n  This release is configured with `-ffour` (which
  works with the `transformers-0.4` series).\n\n0.6.1.3\n-------\n* Each of versions
  0.6.1.2–0.6.1.6 is a 0.6.1 build with a different set of flags configured. Building
  this way allows us to work around bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker. The 0.6.1 release
  notes describe the changes in this version.\n  This release is configured with `-fthree`
  (which works with the `transformers-0.3` series).\n\n0.6.1.2\n-------\n* Each of
  versions 0.6.1.2–0.6.1.6 is a 0.6.1 build with a different set of flags configured.
  Building this way allows us to work around bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker. The 0.6.1
  release notes describe the changes in this version.\n  This release is configured
  with `-ftwo` (which works with the `transformers-0.2` series).\n\n0.6.1\n-----\n*
  Fix an oversight in which the `Control.Monad.Trans.Accum` and\n  `Control.Monad.Trans.Select`
  modules were not backported when built with the\n  `-ffour` flag.\n\n0.6.0.6\n-------\n*
  Each of versions 0.6.0.2–0.6.0.6 is a 0.6 build with a different set of flags configured.
  Building this way allows us to work around bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker. The 0.6
  release notes describe the changes in this version.\n  This release is configured
  with none of `-ftwo`, `-fthree`, `-ffour`, or `-ffive` (which works with `transformers-0.5.3`
  and above).\n\n0.6.0.5\n-------\n* Each of versions 0.6.0.2–0.6.0.6 is a 0.6 build
  with a different set of flags configured. Building this way allows us to work around
  bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker. The 0.6 release notes describe the changes in this
  version.\n  This release is configured with `-ffive` (which works with `transformers-0.5`
  up until, but not including, `transformers-0.5.3`).\n\n0.6.0.4\n-------\n* Each
  of versions 0.6.0.2–0.6.0.6 is a 0.6 build with a different set of flags configured.
  Building this way allows us to work around bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker. The 0.6
  release notes describe the changes in this version.\n  This release is configured
  with `-ffour` (which works with the `transformers-0.4` series).\n\n0.6.0.3\n-------\n*
  Each of versions 0.6.0.2–0.6.0.6 is a 0.6 build with a different set of flags configured.
  Building this way allows us to work around bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker. The 0.6
  release notes describe the changes in this version.\n  This release is configured
  with `-fthree` (which works with the `transformers-0.3` series).\n\n0.6.0.2\n-------\n*
  Each of versions 0.6.0.2–0.6.0.6 is a 0.6 build with a different set of flags configured.
  Building this way allows us to work around bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker. The 0.6
  release notes describe the changes in this version.\n  This release is configured
  with `-ftwo` (which works with the `transformers-0.2` series).\n\n0.6\n---\n* Introduce
  the `Data.Functor.Classes.Generic` module, which provides functions that can generically
  implement methods in the `Eq1`, `Ord1`, `Read1`, and `Show1` classes (without the
  usual boilerplate involved).\n* Introduce the `generic-deriving` flag. When enabled,
  `transformers-compat` will depend on the `generic-deriving` library on older versions
  of GHC to backport `GHC.Generics` support for `Generic` instances and the machinery
  in `Data.Functor.Classes.Generic`.\n* Some instances were present in `Data.Functor.Sum`
  but not in `Control.Monad.Trans.Instances` (e.g., the `Generic`, `Typeable`, and
  `Data` instances for `Sum`). This has been fixed.\n* Backport changes from `transformers-0.5.5`:\n
  \ * Backport the `Semigroup` instance for `Constant`\n  * Add `mapSelect` and `mapSelectT`\n
  \ * Define `selectToContT` (and deprecate `selectToCont` in favor of that)\n  *
  Define some explicit `(*>)` definitions to avoid space leaks\n* Backport changes
  from `transformers-0.5.4` (i.e., add `Bifoldable` and `Bitraversable` instances
  for `Data.Functor.Constant`)\n* Backport changes from `transformers-0.5.3`:\n  *
  Backport the `Control.Monad.Trans.Accum` and `Control.Monad.Trans.Select` modules\n
  \ * Backport the `eitherToErrors` and `elimLift` functions to `Control.Applicative.Lift`\n
  \ * Backport `Bits`, `FiniteBits`, `IsString`, `Num`, `Real`, `Integral`, `Fractional`,
  `Floating`, `RealFrac`, and `RealFloat` instances for `Data.Functor.Identity`\n
  \ * Backport `Monad`, `MonadFail`, and `MonadPlus` instances for `Data.Functor.Reverse`\n
  \ * Backport `Eq1`, `Ord1`, `Read1`, and `Show1` instances for `Data.Proxy`\n* Backport
  changes from `transformers-0.5.2` (i.e., add more `INLINE` annotations)\n* Backport
  changes from `transformers-0.5.1` (i.e., add `Bounded`, `Enum`, `Ix`, and `Storable`
  instances for `Identity`)\n\n0.5.1.4\n-------\n* Each of versions 0.5.1.2–0.5.1.4
  is a 0.5.1 build with a different set of flags configured. Building this way allows
  us to work around bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker. The 0.5.1 release notes describe
  the changes in this version.\n  This release is configured with neither `-ftwo`
  nor `-fthree` (which works with `transformers-0.4` and above).\n\n0.5.1.3\n-------\n*
  Each of versions 0.5.1.2–0.5.1.4 is a 0.5.1 build with a different set of flags
  configured. Building this way allows us to work around bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker.
  The 0.5.1 release notes describe the changes in this version.\n  This release is
  configured with `-fthree` (which works with the `transformers-0.3` series).\n\n0.5.1.2\n-------\n*
  Each of versions 0.5.1.2–0.5.1.4 is a 0.5.1 build with a different set of flags
  configured. Building this way allows us to work around bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker.
  The 0.5.1 release notes describe the changes in this version.\n  This release is
  configured with `-ftwo` (which works with the `transformers-0.2` series).\n\n0.5.1\n-----\n*
  Fix a bug in which `PolyKinds` was enabled on GHC 7.4, resulting in interface file
  bugs on that version of GHC.\n\n0.5.0.4\n-------\n* Each of versions 0.5.0.2–0.5.0.4
  is a 0.5 build with a different set of flags configured. Building this way allows
  us to work around bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker. The 0.5 release notes describe
  the changes in this version.\n  This release is configured with neither `-ftwo`
  nor `-fthree` (which works with `transformers-0.4` and above).\n\n0.5.0.3\n-------\n*
  Each of versions 0.5.0.2–0.5.0.4 is a 0.5 build with a different set of flags configured.
  Building this way allows us to work around bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker. The 0.5
  release notes describe the changes in this version.\n  This release is configured
  with `-fthree` (which works with the `transformers-0.3` series).\n\n0.5.0.2\n-------\n*
  Each of versions 0.5.0.2–0.5.0.4 is a 0.5 build with a different set of flags configured.
  Building this way allows us to work around bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker. The 0.5
  release notes describe the changes in this version.\n  This release is configured
  with `-ftwo` (which works with the `transformers-0.2` series).\n\n0.5\n---\n* Update
  `transformers-compat` to incorporate changes from the `transformers-0.5` series.
  These changes include:\n  * The `Data.Functor.Classes` module was completely redesigned.\n
  \ * Modules now have `Safe` or `Trustworthy` annotations.\n  * Data types and type
  synonyms are poly-kinded when possible.\n* Add `Control.Monad.Trans.Instances`,
  a module of orphan instances that mimic instances available in later versions of
  `transformers`.\n\n0.4.0.4\n-------\n* Each of versions 0.4.0.2–0.4.0.4 is a 0.4
  build with a different set of flags configured. Building this way allows us to work
  around bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker. The 0.4 release notes describe the changes
  in this version.\n  This release is configured with neither `-ftwo` nor `-fthree`
  (which works with `transformers-0.4` and above).\n\n0.4.0.3\n-------\n* Each of
  versions 0.4.0.2–0.4.0.4 is a 0.4 build with a different set of flags configured.
  Building this way allows us to work around bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker. The 0.4
  release notes describe the changes in this version.\n  This release is configured
  with `-fthree` (which works with the `transformers-0.3` series).\n\n0.4.0.2\n-------\n*
  Each of versions 0.4.0.2–0.4.0.4 is a 0.4 build with a different set of flags configured.
  Building this way allows us to work around bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker. The 0.4
  release notes describe the changes in this version.\n  This release is configured
  with `-ftwo` (which works with the `transformers-0.2` series).\n\n0.4\n---\n* Added
  support for the missing `ExceptT` instances from `mtl`.\n\n  This was not done lightly.
  While this means that by default incurring a dependency on `transformers-compat`
  drags in `mtl` when you are\n  using an old `transformers`, it means that users
  do not have to orphan these instances and permits wider adoption of `ExceptT`.\n\n
  \ If you absolutely can't stand `mtl` and really want this package to build as valid
  `Haskell98`, then you can use `cabal install transformers-compat -f-mtl` to avoid
  incurring the dependency to get these instances. However, that is effectively an
  unsupported configuration.\n\n0.3.3.4\n-------\n* Versions 0.3.3.2–0.3.3.4 were
  a successful attempt to fix build problems caused by the cabal backtracker.\n* Each
  of these is a build with a different set of flags configured.\n  This release is
  configured with neither `-ftwo` nor `-fthree` (which works with `transformers-0.4`
  and above).\n\n0.3.3.3\n-------\n* Versions 0.3.3.2–0.3.3.4 were a successful attempt
  to fix build problems caused by the cabal backtracker.\n* Each of these is a build
  with a different set of flags configured.\n  This release is configured with `-fthree`
  (which works with the `transformers-0.3` series).\n\n0.3.3.2\n-------\n* Versions
  0.3.3.2–0.3.3.4 were a successful attempt to fix build problems caused by the cabal
  backtracker.\n* Each of these is a build with a different set of flags configured.\n
  \ This release is configured with `-ftwo` (which works with the `transformers-0.2`
  series).\n\n0.3.2\n-----\n* This release was a failed (or at least, only partially
  successful) attempt to fix build problems caused by the cabal backtracker.\n\n0.3.1\n-----\n*
  `transformers 0.4.1` compatibility\n\n0.3\n---\n* Added the instances for `Data.Functor.Classes`
  from `transformers 0.4`\n* Switched `Control.Applicative.Backwards` and `Data.Functor.Reverse`
  to the split constructor/accessor style from `transformers 0.4`.\n\n0.2\n---\n*
  Added the new types and classes from `transformers 0.4`\n\n0.1.1.1\n-------\n* Wrote
  a better synopsis\n\n0.1.1\n-----\n* Updated to trick `cabal` into building an empty
  `libHStransformers-compat-0.1.a` on GHC 7.6.\n\n0.1\n---\n* Repository initialized
  by pulling the `transformers-0.2` compatibility layer out of `lens`.\n"

  ===================


  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/transformers-compat.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers-compat)
  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ekmett/transformers-compat.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ekmett/transformers-compat)


  This provides a thin compatibility shim on top of transformers-0.2 to add the types
  that were added in transformers-0.3.


  This enables users to maintain haskell-platform compatibility, while still gaining
  access ot the new functionality.
