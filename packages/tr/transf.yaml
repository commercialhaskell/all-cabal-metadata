  /Transf/ is simple text transformer and interpreter.

  It scans its input for guard tokens and passes everything between to transformation functions. Transformation functions are composed from a small set of combinators and may perform arbitrary Haskell computation. Transf contains a full Haskell interpreter and can even interpret its input as Haskell.

  The main purpose of Transf is to allow the embedding of Domain-Specific Languages in text or Markdown files.
  For example one could use it with Diagrams as follows:

  > This is my file. Here is an image:
  >
  > ~~~diagram "A circle!"
  > circle <> stretchX 2 square
  > ~~~

  Transf can then generate the image, and replace the source in the text file with the name of the actual image. It can also include the source.

  > This is my file. Here is an image:
  >
  > ![A circle](a22b15efb10b.png)
  >

  You can supply your own file names. In the above example, the file name is a hash of the source code.
