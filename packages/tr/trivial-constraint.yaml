description: |-
  Since GHC 7.4, constraints are first-class: we have the constraint
  kind, and thus type-classes have a kind of form @k -> Constraint@,
  or @k -> l -> m -> ... -> Constraint@ for a multi-param type class.
  Such type-level functions can be used as arguments to data types, or
  as instances for other type classes.

  For any given arity, the constraint-valued functions form a semigroup
  with respect to “constraint intersection”, which Haskell supports with
  tuple syntax, e.g.

  @
  type NewCstrt¹ a = (Cstrt¹₀ a, Cstrt¹₁ a)
  @

  means that @NewCstrt¹ :: * -> Constraint@ requires that for
  any given parameter both @Cstrt¹₀@ and @Cstrt¹₁@ be fulfilled.
  It is intuitive enough that this type-level semigroup can be extended
  to a monoid, but out of the box this is only possible for arity 0,
  i.e. for @Cstrt⁰ :: Constraint@

  @
  (Cstrt⁰, ()) ~ ((), Cstrt⁰) ~ Cstrt⁰
  @

  For higher arity, this would require type-level lambdas, like for
  @Cstrt² :: * -> * -> Constraint@

  @
  (Cstrt², \\a b -> ()) ~ (\\a b -> (), Cstrt²) ~ Cstrt²
  @

  which is not valid Haskell syntax. It is easy enough to define the
  lambdas in an ad-hoc manner as

  @
  type Unconstrained² a b = ()
  @

  and then

  @
  (Cstrt², Unconstrained²) ~ (Unconstrained², Cstrt²) ~ Cstrt²
  @

  This library provides those /trivial constraints/ in
  a single, documented place, and it uses classes instead of
  type-synonyms (which would be problematic when it comes to partial
  application). Arities 0-9 are provided.

  They can be useful in any construction that is parameterised over a
  constrainer-class, when you do /not/ wish to actually constrain the
  domain with it.

  The other thing this library provides are the opposite classes,
  i.e. @\\a b ... -> Impossible@, constraints which can /never/ be
  fulfilled. They are essentially dual to the @Unconstrained@ ones,
  and can likewise be useful as parameters that should completely
  “disable” a conditional feature.
