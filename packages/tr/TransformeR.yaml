description: |-
  Arbitrary data transformations that work at the level of single individual data
  can be safely applied before applying a differentially private data analysis if
  an adversary only gets to observe the result of the differentially private analysis.
  The current version of the PSI prototype offers support for writing variable
  transformations as R programs that can be run on the data before running
  the other private statistics. Arbitrary R programs can allow for leakage of
  information beyond the output, and "side-channel attacks" where an adversary
  observes this additional leakage and thereby undermines the privacy guarantees.
  TransformeR is a subset of the R language that can serve
  as a domain specifc language useful to write the needed data transformations and
  at the same time be more maneageable for preventing security weaknesses
  and side-channel attacks.
