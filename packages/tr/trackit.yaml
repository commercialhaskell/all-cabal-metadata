description: ! "# trackit\n\n`trackit` is a command-line tool that listens for changes
  in a user-supplied directory. Whenever there is a change, a custom command is executed
  and its standard output is shown live in the terminal.\n\n![](images/trackit.gif)\n\n##
  Examples\n\nShow a live listing of the files in the current directory:\n\n    >
  trackit --watch-dir=. --command=\"ls --color\"\n\nShow a live revision graph of
  a Git repository:\n\n    > GIT_DIR=`git rev-parse --git-dir`\n    > trackit --watch-tree=$GIT_DIR
  --command=\"git log --graph --all --oneline --decorate --color\"\n\n## Installation\n\n`trackit`
  can be installed from [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/trackit) using
  Cabal:\n\n    > cabal install trackit\n\n## Usage\n\nRun `trackit -h` to get more
  information about available flags.\n\n`trackit` starts a new buffer in the terminal
  and uses it to display the output of the command given as the `--command` flag.
  The display reacts to the following keyboard events:\n\n  * **q** - Quit `trackit`.\n
  \ * **arrow keys** - Scroll the output buffer (also with PgUp/PgDown/Home/End).\n
  \ * **space key** - Re-run the command and update the buffer. This is useful if
  no watch directory is provided, or if the output is affected by events outside of
  the watch directory.\n\nWhen multiple changes occur in a short time in the watched
  directory (e.g. when switching branches in a repository), it may not be desired
  to have `trackit` react to every single change. This is especially the case if the
  monitored command is expensive (e.g. `git log` in a large repository). For this
  reason, `trackit` requires a *stabilization period* before running an update. If
  an event occurs during that period, the period clock is restarted and the update
  is delayed further.\n\nThe stabilization period can be set in milliseconds using
  the `--stabilization` flag. A lower value gives quicker response times, but increases
  the risk of getting spurious updates when a tight sequence changes occurs in the
  watched directory. The default stabilization period is 200 ms.\n\n## Comparison
  to `watch`\n\n`trackit` offers two main advantages over the similar tool [watch](https://linux.die.net/man/1/watch):\n\n
  \ 1. `trackit` only reacts to file system changes. This avoids having to run a potentially
  costly command periodically. For example, the following command can easily consume
  a substantial part of your processor's cycles when run in a large repository:\n\n
  \    ```\n     > watch -c -t -n 0,5 -- git log --graph --all --oneline --decorate
  --color\n     ```\n\n  2. `trackit` supports scrolling, and keeps the scrolled view
  even if the output is updated.\n\n## Tips and tricks\n\n### `git status`\n\n`git
  status` is slightly tricky to track using `trackit`. The reason is that the command
  creates a temporary lock file in the `.git` directory, resulting in a feedback loop
  between `trackit` and `git status` (if `trackit` listens for changes in the `.git`
  directory).\n\nSince version 2.16, Git supports the flag `--no-optional-locks`,
  which prevents commands like `git status` to create locks. So we can use the following
  to track the result of `git status`:\n\n    trackit -t . -c \"git --no-optional-locks
  -c color.ui=always status\"\n\nThis command also forces colored output, which is
  useful if this option hasn't been set globally.\n"
