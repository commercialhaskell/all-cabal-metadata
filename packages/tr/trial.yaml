  The `Trial` Data Structure is a `Either`-like structure that keeps events history
  inside. The data type allows to keep track of the `Fatality` level of each such
  event entry (`Warning` or `Error`).

  ## Project Structure

  This is a multi-package project that has the following packages inside:

  | Package                      | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
  |------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `trial`                      | The main package that contains the `Trial` data structure, instances and useful functions to work with the structure. |
  | `trial-optparse-applicative` | `Trial` structure integration with the [`optparse-applicative`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optparse-applicative) library for Command Line Interface. |
  | `trial-tomland`              | `Trial` structure integration with the [`tomland`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tomland) library for TOML configurations.   |
  | `trial-example`              | Example project with the usage example of the `Trial` data structure. |

  ## How to use `trial`

  `trial` is compatible with the latest GHC versions starting from `8.6.5`.

  In order to start using `trial` in your project, you will need to set it up with
  the three easy steps:

  1. Add the dependency on `trial` in your project's `.cabal` file. For this, you
     should modify the `build-depends` section by adding the name of this library.
     After the adjustment, this section could look like this:

     ```haskell
     build-depends: base ^>= 4.14
                  , trial ^>= 0.0
     ```

  2. In the module where you plan to use `Trial`, you should add the import:

     ```haskell
     import Trial (Trial (..), fiasco, prettyPrintTrial)
     ```

  3. Now you can use the types and functions from the library:

     ```haskell
     main :: IO ()
     main = putStrLn $ prettyPrintTrial $ fiasco "This is fiasco, bro!"
     ```

  ## Trial Data Structure

  Let's have a closer look at the `Trial` data structure.
  `Trial` is a sum type that has two constructors:

    - `Fiasco` — represents the unsuccessful state similar to the `Left`
      constructor of `Either`. However, unlike `Left`, `Fiasco` holds a list of all
      `error`-like items that happened along the way. Each such item has a notion of
      `Fatality` (the severity of the error). The following cases cover
      `Fatality`:
        + `Error` — fatal error that led to the final fatal `Fiasco`.
        + `Warning` — non-essential error, which didn't affect the result.
    - `Result` — represents the successful state similar to the `Right`
      constructor of `Either`. However, unlike `Right`, `Result` keeps the list of
      all `error`-like items that happened along the way. All error items are
      warnings as the final result was found anyway.

  Schematically, `Trial` has the following internal representation:

  ```haskell
  data Trial e a
             │ │
             │ ╰╴Resulting type
             │
             ╰╴An error item type

      -- | Unsuccessful case
      = Fiasco (DList (Fatality, e))
                │      │         │
                │      │         ╰╴One error item
                │      │
                │      ╰╴Level of damage
                │
                ╰╴Efficient list-container for error type items

      -- | Successful case
      | Result (DList e) a
                │     │  │
                │     │  ╰╴Result
                │     │
                │     ╰╴One warning item
                │
                ╰╴Efficient list-container for warning type items
  ```

  ### `Trial` instances

  In order to follow the basis idea of the data type, `Trial` uses smart
  constructors and different instances to make the structure work the way it
  works.

  Here are the main points:

  * All `Fiasco`s can be created only with the `Error` `Fatality` level.
  * The `Fatality` level can be eased only through the `Semigroup` appends of
    different `Trial`s.
  * All error items in `Result` should have only `Warning` `Fatality` level. This
    is guaranteed by the `Trial` `Semigroup` and `Applicative` instances.
  * `Semigroup` is responsible for the correct collection of history events, their
    `Fatality` level and the final result decision.
  * `Semigroup` chooses the latest 'Result' and combines all events.
  * Think of `Semigroup` instance as of high-level combinator of your result.
  * `Applicative` is responsible for the correct combination of `Trial`s.
  * `Applicative` returns `Fiasco`, if at least one value if `Fiasco`, combine all
    events.
  * Think of `Applicative` instance as of low-level combinator of your result on the
    record fields level.
  * `Alternative` instance could help when you want to stop on the first
    `Result` and get the history of all failures before it.
  * `Alternative`: return first `Result`, also combine all events for
    all `Trial`s before this `Result`.

  ## Tagged `Trial`

  Additionally, there is a `Trial`-like data type that has a notion of the `tag`
  inside.

  The main difference from `Trial` is that the resulting type contains additional
  information of the tag (or source it came from). The type looks like this:

  ```haskell
  type TaggedTrial tag a = Trial tag (tag, a)
  ```

  Due to the described instances implementation, the tag will always be aligned
  with the final source it came from.

  The library provides different ways to add the tag:
    * Manual with the `withTag` function
    * Using `OverloadedLabels`and the provided `IsLabel` instance for
      `TaggedTrial`.

  You can choose the one that is more suitable for your use-case.

  ## Usage Examples

  One of the use cases when one could consider using `Trial` is the configurations
  in the application.

  If you need to collect configurations from different places, combine the results
  into a single configuration, you can find the `Trial` data structure quite
  handy. With `trial` you can get the event history for free and also you can keep
  track of where the final result for each component of your configurations type
  comes from (by using `tag` functionality).

  The complete example in the `trial-example` package. It combines CLI, TOML
  configuration and the default options provided in the source code.

  | Executable | Description |
  |------------|-------------|
  | [`trial-example`](https://github.com/kowainik/trial/blob/master/trial-example/app/Main.hs) | The basic example of config problem with the usage of `TaggedTrial` |
  | [`trial-example-advanced`](https://github.com/kowainik/trial/blob/master/trial-example/app-advanced/Main.hs) | The basic example of config problem with the usage of `TaggedTrial` with the `Phase` based approach. |

  To run it you can use the following command:

  ```shell
  $ cabal run trial-example
  $ cabal run trial-example-advanced
  ```

  For the successful result you can use the CLI and provide necessary information
  in order to have the complete configurations:

  ```shell
  $ cabal run trial-example -- --host="abc"
  $ cabal run trial-example-advanced -- --host="abc"
  ```
