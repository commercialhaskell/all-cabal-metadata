  # trimdent

  `Trimdent` is a simple library for smartly trimming and unindenting strings.

  ```haskell
  >>> import Text.RawString.QQ (r)
  >>> trimdent [r|func add(x int, y int) int {
                    return x + y
                  }
               |]
  "func add(x int, y int) int {\n\
  \  return x + y\n\
  \}"
  ```

  ## Why is this useful?

  This library is useful when you are writing your own quasi quoter and want to
  sanitize whitespace.

  ## How does it compare to other libraries?

  * [Neat-interpolation](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/neat-interpolation)
    exposes the same functionality but only in an interpolating quasi quoter.
    This means that you can't easily use it in your own quoters.
  * [raw-strings-qq](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/raw-strings-qq-1.1)
    gives quasi quoters to express multi-line strings, but they don't do any
    trimming.
