  # `tracked-files`

  This is a tool for listing all files that aren't `.gitignore`d that also exist.

  ## Motivation

  `git ls-files` alone doesn't include new files, and having a way to access this
  list can be helpful when determining what files to care about during token
  analysis.


  ## Install

  ```sh
  stack install
  ```

  ## Test

  ```sh
  stack test
  ```
