  Non-Determinism Monad for Tree Search
  =====================================

  This Haskell library provides an implementation of the MonadPlus type
  class that represents the search space as a tree whose constructors
  represent mzero, return, and mplus.

  Such a tree can be used to implement different search strategies,
  e.g., by using a queue. It can also be used as a basis for parallel
  search strategies that evaluate different parts of the search space
  concurrently.
