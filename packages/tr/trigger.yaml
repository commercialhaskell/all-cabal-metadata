description: ! "# Trigger\n\n`Trigger` is a cross platform file system watcher for
  super fast build-and-restart workflows. When files change, it can be configured
  to:\n - run build tasks\n - restart your app in the background\n\n`fswatch` and
  others are good general purpose tools for triggering tasks on filesystem changes.
  \nHowever, they don't support stopping and starting background processes.\n\n# How
  does it work?\n\n```\n         -------------------------------\n        | start
  processes in background |\n         -------------------------------\n                       |\n
  \                wait for change <-----------\n                       |                     |\n
  \        -------------------------------     |\n        |   stop background processes
  \  |    |\n         -------------------------------     |\n                       |
  \                    |\n         -------------------------------     |\n        |
  run build tasks sequentially  |    |\n         -------------------------------     |\n
  \                      |                     |\n         -------------------------------
  \    |\n        | start processes in background |    |\n         -------------------------------
  \    |\n                       |                     |\n                        ---------------------
  \ \n\n```\n\n# Installation\n\nIt's Haskell, so download Stack.\n\nClone and run
  `stack build --install`\n\nThis should install `trigger` on your PATH.\n\nIf you
  get linking issues on Windows, see [this issue](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/425)\n\n#
  Configuration\n\nCreate a file named `trigger.yaml`\n\nHere is an example:\n```yaml\n-
  dirs:\n    - \"src\"\n  files:\n    - \"**/*.hs\"\n  ignore:\n    - \"**/Ignored.hs\"\n
  \ tasks: \n    - \"stack build\"\n  run:\n    - \"target/executable\"      \n```\n\nWhich
  consists of:\n\n- `dirs`: one or more directories to watch for changes\n- `files`:
  one or more file globs. Files that don't match will not trigger. \n- `ignore`: (optional)
  one or more file globs. Overrides the above file globs to exclude particular files.
  \n- `tasks`: (optional) one or more tasks, which are run sequentially in the foreground.
  Any error will stop subsequent tasks.\n- `run`: (optional) one or more background
  processes.\n"
