description: |-
  A portable library of functor and monad transformers, inspired by
  the paper

  * \"Functional Programming with Overloading and Higher-Order
  Polymorphism\", by Mark P Jones,
  in /Advanced School of Functional Programming/, 1995
  (<http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/pubs/springschool.html>).

  This package contains:

  * the monad transformer class (in "Control.Monad.Trans.Class")

  * concrete functor and monad transformers, each with associated
  operations and functions to lift operations associated with other
  transformers.

  The package can be used on its own in portable Haskell code, in
  which case operations need to be manually lifted through transformer
  stacks (see "Control.Monad.Trans.Class" for some examples).
  Alternatively, it can be used with the non-portable monad classes in
  the @mtl@ or @monads-tf@ packages, which automatically lift operations
  introduced by monad transformers through other transformers.
