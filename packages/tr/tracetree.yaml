description: |-
  The tracetree library can be used to conveniently write
  Haskell data structures as trees represented as JSON
  files. These JSON files can then be inspected with any
  JSON viewer; the JSON viewer's functionality to collapse
  part of the JSON tree can be particularly convenient when
  exploring large objects.

  Additionally, the ttrender executable can be used to render
  these JSON trees as .svg or .png files, and provides
  various command line flags for controlling the layout of
  the tree (colour, orientation, hiding nodes, etc.).

  The tracetree library and ttrender executable are
  independent components; if you don't want to add the
  dependency on tracetree to your project, you can just
  generate the .JSON files directly in your code; the format
  is not complicated (indeed, you can create them by hand
  or post-process previously exported .JSON files).
