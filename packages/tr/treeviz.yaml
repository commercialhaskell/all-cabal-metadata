description: |
  This is the `TreeViz` library, written by David Banas.

  For more info, please, see the comments in `Data/Tree/LogTree.hs`.
  Alternatively, view the Haddock generated HTML documentation:
    $ cabal haddock

  For usage examples, please, see:
  - src/Main.hs

  The intent of this library is to provide the data structures, type classes,
  and support functions necessary for working with and visualizing computation
  decomposition trees. For instance, the initial motivation for creating this
  package was the need to visualize how data flow occurs in a fast Fourier
  transform (FFT) of arbitrary radices and either decimation style (time or
  frequency).
