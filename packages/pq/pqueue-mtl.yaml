description: |-
  Contains several implementations of data structures implementing a /single-in, single-out/ paradigm,
  and implements monad transformers for their safe use.  The monad transformer part of the library
  includes tools to fully encapsulate single-threaded use of a priority queue in a monad, including an
  array-based heap implementation.
  In general, the purely functional queue types can be ordered in increasing order of speed on generic insertion/deletion operations
  as follows: 'Stack', 'Queue', 'PQueue', 'IntQueue', 'SkewQueue', 'FQueue', 'Heap'.
  ('PQueue', 'IntQueue', and 'SkewQueue' are all very nearly the same speed.)
  Work is in progress on a van Emde Boas
  or y-fast priority queue implementation, which provides sublogarithmic functionality for all operations.
  /This package is now deprecated.  Use queuelike instead./
