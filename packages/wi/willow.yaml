changelog: "# Revision history\n\nVersion numbering for 'willow' follows the [standard
  Haskell versioning \npolicy](https://pvp.haskell.org), where the first *two* numbers
  together \nindicate the major version of the package, the third the minor, and the
  fourth \nthe patch; a fifth number is optional and indicates a revision purely to
  the \ndocumentation and/or packaging.\n\n\n## v/dom/0.1.0.0. -- 2021-04-16\n\n###
  Added\n\n* f/1.1.  Decoding and encoding according to the schemes recommended by
  the\n  HTML5 working groups for compatibility with web content (which occasionally\n
  \ depart from the original descriptions of those encodings)\n* f/2.1.1. (minimal)
  \ Just enough of the DOM tree to represent a static HTML \n  document; consider
  this still a very rough placeholder not suitable for much\n\n### Known issues\n\n*
  i/9. & i/10.  Reading files in certain East Asian encodings with large \n  character
  pools (Big5, EUC-KR, JIS-0208, etc.) is usually particularly slow\n"

description: "# About\n\n`willow` is the backbone of the HTML rendering framework
  used by the eponymous \nWillow browser suite; it provides both the underlying data
  structures, and \nlater formats them for display.  In this, it is somewhat language-agnostic,
  \nso that both a (very basic) HTML page and a (coerced) Gemini response would \nhave
  similar representations and be rendered through the same pathway.\n\nThis readme
  is rather sparse, as it has been written for a subfolder of the \ncomplete repository;
  for full info on the project, see the primary readme in \neither [this directory](README.project.md),
  [its parent](../README.md), or the \n[online host](https://code.eitilt.life/src/willow/README.md),
  whichever of \nthose links may work.\n"
