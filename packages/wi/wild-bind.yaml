description: ! "# wild-bind\n\nWildBind is a dynamic and programmable key binding
  framework. See https://github.com/debug-ito/wild-bind for WildBind in general.\n\n##
  Architecture and Terminology\n\nWildBind consists of `FrontEnd` and `Binding`.\n\n
  \                    +-------------------+\n    (user) --input-> |   desktop env.
  \   |---[FrontEnd]---[Binding]\n                     |                   |                    |\n
  \                    | (front-end state) |             (back-end state)\n                     +-------------------+\n\n-
  A `FrontEnd` interfaces with a desktop environment. It reads input from the user
  and the state of the desktop environment. The state is called \"front-end state\".
  `FrontEnd` passes those two kinds of data to `Binding`.\n- A `Binding` binds actions
  to input symbols. Optionally it has its own state, which is called \"back-end state\".\n\n\n##
  wild-bind Packages\n\n- [wild-bind](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wild-bind):
  WildBind core data types and functions. This package defines `FrontEnd`, `Binding`
  and other common types. Although WildBind is mainly targeted to number pads, its
  core is independent of any input types or desktop environments.\n- [wild-bind-x11](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wild-bind-x11):
  A `FrontEnd` implementation for X11 desktop environments.\n- [wild-bind-indicator](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wild-bind-indicator):
  A GUI that describes current `Binding` to the user.\n- [wild-bind-task-x11](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wild-bind-task-x11):
  A bundle package that combines all packages above. End users should use this package
  first.\n\n\n## Author\n\nToshio Ito <debug.ito at gmail.com>\n\n"
