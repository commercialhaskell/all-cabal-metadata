  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bartavelle/withdependencies.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bartavelle/withdependencies)

  Model computation with dependencies, and evaluate them over streams of elements.

  This module was created to handle tree-like computations that require elements from a stream that might arrive in arbitrary order.

  The particular use case was a computation requiring several files from a tar archive. The archive would be parsed as a stream of files, and the computation would end as soon as all required files would be traversed.
