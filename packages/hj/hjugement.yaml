description: "# Majority Judgment\n\n## Common language\n\nThe Majority Judgment asks
  us to answer to a specific, operationally actionable,\nquestion about several choices,
  by judging each choice in an absolute way\n(i.e. such that the removal or addition
  of choices\ndoes not change our evaluation of the other choices)\nby giving them
  a grade (or level) on a common scale.\n\nThis common scale contains as many grades
  as our supposed common expertise\nis able to distinguish, in order to faithfully
  represent\nthe properties of the attribute it tries to measure.\nHence, a common
  scale should be crafted for each different attribute.\nThe inter-subjective meaning
  of each grade\nbeing reinforced by the practice of judgments.\n\n### Examples\n\nExamples
  of common scales could be:\n- [“To Reject”, “Insufficient”, “Acceptable”, “Good”,
  “Very Good”] for quality,\n- [“Very Bad”, “Bad”, “Rather Bad”, “Rather Good”, “Good”,
  “Very Good”] for quality,\n- [“Strongly Against”, “Against”, “Rather Against”, “Indifferent”,
  “Rather For”, “For”, “Strongly For”] for adhesion,\n- [“Very Wrong”, “Wrong”, “Rather
  Wrong”, “Rather Well”, “Well”, “Very Well”] for rightness,\n- [“None”, “Not Enough”,
  “Enough”, “Much”, “Too Much”] for quantity,\n- [“To Do”, “Prioritized”, “Blocking”,
  “Urgent”, “Too Urgent”] for priority,\n- [“Useless”, “Interesting”, “Useful”, “Indispensable”,
  “Enslaving”] for utility.\n\nNote that the more a scale enables to judge in the
  absolute,\nthe more resistant to Arrow's paradox it is.\nHere, depending on the
  judges,\nsome of the above scales using the “Very X”/“X”/“Rather X” structure,\nmay
  be too subjective to discourage the relative comparison of choices,\nthis said,
  if it is the exact expressions used in everyday parlance,\nit may be sensible to
  use them.\nIn any case, to not confuse/skew the judgments it is important\nthat
  a scale spans only on a single dimension/criteria.\n\n## Judging one choice\n\nThe
  “majority grade” is the fundamental indicator of the Majority Judgment.\nLocated
  at the middle of the distribution of grades obtained by a choice,\nit is also known
  by high school students under the name “median”,\nthat is to say, the grade such
  that 50% of grades are lower or egal to it,\nand 50% are greater or egal to it.\nSuch
  that regardless the way we look at it,\nthere is always an absolute majority among
  the judges\nwhich agree to defend the majority grade against any other grade.\nIn
  other words: whoever among the judges is against, is necessarily in minority.\nTherefore,
  the majority grade brings the judges together by minimizing\nthe number of unsatisfied
  among them.\nLike so, the majority grade enables us to overcome the old notion of
  majority\nexpressed on the count of our scattered voices, which divides us.\n\nMoreover,
  one can see that the farest an individual judgment is\nfrom the majoritary grade,
  the less impact it has on the result.\nThis rewards honest individual judgments,\nby
  ignoring as near as may be the most cranky or strategic judgements.\n\nIf the number
  of individual judgments is small and even\n(eg. for 6 judges: [“Insufficient”, “Acceptable”,
  “Acceptable”, “Good”, “Good”, “Good”]),\nthere is however a probability that two
  different grades\nborder the middlemost of this dilated scale (here: “Acceptable”
  and “Good”).\nBut only the lower grade (here: “Acceptable”) rewards consensus,\nand
  thus is considered to be the most consensual.\nIndeed, if any other choice obtains
  less scattered judgments\n(eg. [“Acceptable”, “Acceptable”, “Acceptable”, “Acceptable”,
  “Good”, “Good”])\nall enclosed into these two grades,\nit will obtain a majoritary
  grade\ngreater or egal (here: “Acceptable”) to the one of this choice.\nWhich would
  not necessarily be the case with the greater grade (here: “Good”).\n\n## Ranking
  many choices\n\nThe ranking of choices is done by comparing their respective majority
  grades.\nThose obtaining the same majority grade are compared further\nby applying
  again the principle of minimizing unsatisfied judges :\none judgment giving this
  majority grade is removed of their distributions\nuntil two different majority grades
  are obtained,\nor both choices precisely have the same distribution of individual
  judgments.\nIn which case, it is enough that one judge\nchange the grade it gives
  to at least one of those choices,\nand/or it may be wise to also judge on other
  criterias.\n\n## Properties\n\nThe Majority Judgment is:\n\n- allowing anonymity:\n
  \ interchanging the names of judges does not change the outcome:\n  all judges are
  given an equal power.\n\n- neutral:\n  interchanging the names of choices does not
  change the outcome:\n  all choices are treated equally.\n\n- complete:\n  every
  choice is either superior or inferior\n  to any other choice, or both when equal.\n
  \ Hence the Majority Judgement is not subject\n  to Condorcet's paradox.\n\n- monotone:\n
  \ if a choice is superior or egal to another one,\n  and a judge increases its grade
  for it,\n  it becomes strictly superior.\n\n- transitive:\n  if a first choice is
  superior to a second one,\n  and this second one is superior to a third,\n  then
  the first is superior to the third).\n\n- coherent:\n  it is independent of irrelevant
  alternatives as formulated by Nash-Chernoff:\n  removal or addition of choices does
  not change\n  the judges’ evaluations of the other choices.\n  Hence the Majority
  Judgement is not subject\n  to Arrow's paradox.\n\n- strategy-proof-in-grading:\n
  \ judging a choice higher or lower\n  than our intimate judgement has the opposite
  impact\n  on its most consensual majority grade.\n\n- partially strategy-proof-in-ranking:\n
  \ increasing (resp. decreasing) the rank of a choice with respect to another choice,\n
  \ can not decrease (resp. increase) the rank of this other choice.\n\n- not Condorcet-consistent:\n
  \ not guarantying the selection of a choice\n  which is preferred by a majority
  against every of the others separately.\n  \n  Except when the electorate is “polarized”:\n
  \ when the higher (resp. the lower) a judge evaluates one choice the lower (resp.
  the higher)\n  she/he evaluates the other, so there can be no consensus;\n  hence
  when judges are most tempted to manipulate.\n  \n  This property is judged undesirable,
  by Michel Balinski and Rida Laraki,\n  as they prove how easily the Majority Rule
  can go wrong when voting\n  on but two candidates, let alone more.\n\n- not excluding
  the no-show paradox:\n  it may be better for a judge not to judge\n  than to express
  her/his opinion sincerely because her/his vote\n  can tip the scales against his
  favorite choice.\n  \n  This property is judged insignificant, by Michel Balinski
  and Rida Laraki,\n  when compared with the serious problems of methods of election,\n
  \ the Arrow and Condorcet paradoxes and strategic manipulation.\n  Moreover, the
  only methods based on measuring that exclude\n  the no-show paradox are point-summing
  methods,\n  which, amongst other drawbacks, are highly manipulable.\n\n## Resources\n-
