synopsis: JSON Schema library
changelog: |
  # 1.8.0

  + Add GHC 8.4 support (thanks @4e6 !).
  + Drop GHC 7.10 support.
  + Fix JSON Pointer resolution error.

  # 1.8.0

  + Allow HTTPS references (thanks @creichert!).
  + Use `safe-exceptions` to eliminate the risk of catching asynchronous exceptions.

  # 1.7.2

  + Remove upper bounds.

  # 1.7.1

  + Bump http-types.

  # 1.7.0

  + Test with GHC 8.2. Drop GHC 7.8.
  + Rework `allUniqueValues` related utility functions.

  # 1.6.3

  + Bump hjsonpointer and QuickCheck.

  # 1.6.2

  + Bump aeson.

  # 1.6.1

  + Fix Haddocks.

  # 1.6.0

  + Fix defect where validators alongside "$ref" weren't ignored.

  + Fix defect where local references would fail if an "id" key had set resolution scope to start from a different document.

  + Vendor latest tests.

  + Remove `ReferencedSchemas`.

  + Create `Scope` to hold information that changes during validation.

  + Use a sum type for "type" values. Thanks to Philip Weaver (GitHub @pheaver).

  # 1.5.0.1

  + Raise test dep upper bounds.

  # 1.5.0.0

  + Report details of `"required"` validator failure.
  + Bump `directory`.

  # 1.4.0.0

  + Rename `Data.JsonSchema.*` modules to `JSONSchema.*`.
  + Rename `Data.Validator.*` modules to `JSONSchema.Validator.*`.

  # 1.3.0.1

  + Bump `vector`.

  # 1.3.0.0

  + Rewrite failure messages.

  We used to return a list of every failed validator, no matter how far it was buried within subschemas of the original schema.

  Now we return a tree of failure messages, so that if the first schema had only three validators, then no more than three top level failures will be returned.

  + Move the code to parse each validator from JSON from `Data.Validator.Draft4` into the validators' modules themselves.

  + Switch from Prelude to Protolude.

  + Switch `Data.JsonSchema.Fetch` from lazy to strict bytestrings.

  # 1.2.0.2

  + Bump hspec.

  # 1.2.0.1

  + Switch to hspec for tests.

  # 1.2.0.0

  + Return `AdditionalPropertiesObject` error correctly (was mistakenly returning `AdditionalItemsObject` instead.
  + Don't silence errors resulting from subschemas of "anyOf" or "oneOf".

  # 1.1.0.1

  + Bump `aeson` and `hjsonpointer`.

  # 1.1.0.0

  + Rename `schemaForSchemas` to `metaSchema` and `schemaForSchemasBytes` to `metaSchemaBytes`.

  # 1.0.0.0

  ## Bug fixes:

  + Fix JSON Pointer bug. Pointers were being built in reverse order and so were totally invalid.
  + Use `.:!` instead of `.:?` to parse the draft 4 schema. The only way to omit optional fields in JSON Schema Draft 4 is to omit them entirely, `"null"` can't be used for this.

  ## API Changes:

  + Add referenced schema loop detection.
  + Add a new `referencesValidity` function.
  + `checkSchema` now checks referenced schema's validity in addition to the starting schema's validity. This change bubbles up to the one-step validation functions as well.
  + Switch most of the fetching code to use `URISchemaMap` instead of `ReferencedSchemas`. It didn't need to know about the more complicated data type.
  + Rething failure related names. Change `Invalid` to `Failure`, add a new `Invalid` type alias which is only used for final results.
  + Failures now include the failing part of the data as well as a JSON Pointer to it, so you don't have to worry about resolving the pointer.

  ## Fundamental Changes:

  + Make `Fail` (previously `Failure`) an instance of `Functor`.
  + Add a `Validator` data type which is an instance of `Profunctor`.
  + Add a `Spec` data type for collections of `Validators`.

  ## General:

  + Switch from 2 to 4 space indentation.
  + Update the vendored JSON Schema Test Suite.

  # 0.10.0.3

  + Bump http-client.

  # 0.10.0.2

  + Enable GHC 8.

  # 0.10.0.1

  + Fix .cabal file.

  # 0.10

  + Rewrite fetching internals.
  + Fix reference resolution defects, add more tests.
  + Switch to a Perl style regex library, which is closer to ECMAScript regexes than the previous Posix style one.
  + Add one-step validation functions ('fetchFilesystemAndValidate' and 'fetchHTTPAndValidate').
  + Alias the validation failure type exported by 'Data.JsonSchema.Draft4' to
  'Invalid', change its field names.

  # 0.9

  + Partial rewrite. The API of the library has changed, see the examples
  folder for how to use the new one.

  + Users of the library can now write schemas in Haskell as well as JSON.

  # 0.8

  + Improve scope updating and resolving.
  + Rename RawSchema's _rsObject field to _rsData.
  + Make RawSchema's _rsURI field a Maybe. This way schemas without a starting URI can say so explicitly with Nothing instead of with "".
  + Rename Graph to SchemaGraph. Declare it with data instead of type. Give it a field referencing the starting schema. This field is used to find the curent schema if no URI is in scope and a self-referencing $ref is found (e.g. "#").
  + Change the order of the last two arguments to fetchReferencedSchemas.

  # 0.7.1

  + Support GHC 7.8 again.

  # 0.7

  Change error type from Text to ValidationFailure.

  Revert the 0.6 changes to validate. Also switch from Vector to list. Validate is now:
    Schema err -> Value -> [ValidationFailure err]

  Add fetchReferencedSchemas', which lets the user provide their own MonadIO function to be used when fetching schemas. This lets them do things like only fetch schemas from particular domains.

  # 0.6

  Break the API so the library doesn't induce boolean blindness.

  Change validate
    was: Schema -> Value -> Vector ValErr
    now: Schema -> Value -> Either (Vector ValErr) Value

  Change Schema
    was: type Schema = Vector Validator
    now: newtype Schema = Schema { _unSchema :: [Validator] }

  # 0.5.3

  + Switch from http-conduit to http-client.

  # 0.5.2

  + Add convenience function for validating and compiling draft 4 schemas simultaneously.

  # 0.5.1

  + Switch from wreq to http-conduit; drop lens dependency.

  # 0.5

  + Start changelog.
  + Rename Utils.hs to Helpers.hs.
  + Move all non-ValidatorGen functions in Validators.hs to Helpers.hs.
  + Various touchups.

  # DEPRECATION NOTICE

  `hjsonschema` was an attempt to build a very modular JSON Schema library. Validators have [a concrete type](src/JSONSchema/Validator/Types.hs) and can be mixed and matched into new [Specs](src/JSONSchema/Types.hs).

  However this flexibility came at the price of complicating the code. I don't think it was the right tradeoff, especially since situations where you'd want to change what validators make up a `Spec` at runtime seem rare.

  Also, there are many parts of JSON Schema that `hjsonschema` doesn't implement properly (as you can see from the issue tracker). I'm hoping that a new JSON Schema library will come along that handles these correctly. In the meantime I'm happy to merge working fixes into here.

The [root ref in remote ref](./JSON-Schema-Test-Suite/tests/draft4/refRemote.json) test has been modified to fix [#175](https://github.com/json-schema-org/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite/issues/175).
