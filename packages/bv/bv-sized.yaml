synopsis: a bitvector datatype that is parameterized by the vector width
changelog: "# Changelog for [`bv-sized` package](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bv-sized)\n\n##
  1.0.3 *April 2021*\n\n* New instances (`NFData`, `Random`)\n* New functions for
  `BV` that create uniformly random bitvectors\n* Fix: Adds `asBV` for `SignedBV`
  (should have been there to begin with)\n\n## 1.0.2 *August 2020*\n\n* Allows tasty
  1.3 for test suite\n* Fixes bug in signedClamp function which made it possible to
  violate\n  the nonnegative invariant on the internal representation of BVs\n* Fixes
  divide by zero error in rotateL and rotateR\n* Enhances test suite to test well-formedness
  of all operators that\n  return a BV\n* Fixes some documentation\n\n## 1.0.1 *May
  2020*\n\nThis fixed a subtle bug in the test suite which occasionally caused a\ndivide
  by zero exception.\n\n## 1.0.0 *May 2020*\n\nThis is a completely breaking change
  and it is completely incompatible\nwith any previous use for this library.\n\n  *
  Bitvectors no longer track their own width. Every operations that\n    relies on
  runtime awareness of the width (for instance,\n    truncations) requires an expicit
  'NatRepr' argument.\n  * Bitvectors do not support any typical instances you might
  hope for\n    (Num, Bits, etc.). This is because they are not interpreted by\n    default
  as signed or unsigned, so any class that requires such an\n    interpretation is
  not supported. We do provide wrapper types that\n    supply those instances when
  the bitvector width is known\n    (SignedBV/UnsignedBV).\n  * Every operation has
  been renamed. Most are pretty straightforward\n    (e.g. bvAdd ==> add).\n  * Several
  previously unsupported operations have been added\n    (e.g. count leading zeros,
  conversion to/from bit/bytestrings)\n  * The App and BitLayout modules have been
  removed entirely. Both are\n    potentially useful, but are out of date and probably
  should be in\n    a different package anyway.\n  * New modules\n\t  * Data.BitVector.Sized.{Signed,Unsigned}:
  wrappers for BV that\n\t\tprovide many instances\n\t  * Data.BitVector.Sized.Overflow:
  wrappers for operations that\n        provide overflow information as part of the
  output\n\n## 0.7.0 *April 2019*\n  * extractWithRepr now takes a NatRepr as an argument
  to specify the\n    index, which it always should have.\n  * Updated to recent parameterized-utils
  hackage release, which fixes\n    the build failures in the previous bv-sized release.\n\n##
  0.6.0 *March 2019*\n  * changed WithRepr functions to '\n  * added Num, Bits instances\n
  \ * bitVector now takes arbitrary Integral argument\n  * add 'bitLayoutAssignmentList'
  function (see haddocks for details\n  * Hid BV constructor, exposed BitVector as
  pattern\n\n## 0.5.1 *August 2018*\n  * fixed github URL\n\n## 0.5.0 *August 2018*\n
  \ * Added a lot of better support for the App module, including a type\n    class
  for embedding BVApp expressions along with associated smart\n    constructors\n\n##
  0.4.0 *April 2018*\n  * Added App module for BitVector expression languages and
  evaluation\n\n## 0.3.0 *April 2018*\n  * fixed bug with bvShiftR, it was doing a
  left shift!\n  * Division now rounds to zero for negative integers, bvDiv -> bvQuot\n
  \ * added Ix instance for BitVector w\n  * added bv0, zero-width vector\n  * bvConcatMany,
  bvGetBytesU (conversion to/from list of bytes)\n\n## 0.2.1 *March 2018*\n  * bvMulFSU\n
  \ * bvDivU, bvDivS\n  * Added Read instance, fixed Show to be compatible. Using\n
  \   prettyclass for pretty printing. (I guess this is semi-breaking,\n    but whatever.)\n\n##
  0.2 *March 2018*\n  * bv -> bitVector, so this is very much a breaking change\n
  \ * bvShiftL, bvShiftRL, bvShiftRA\n  * bvLTU, bvLTS\n\n## 0.1.1.1 *March 2018*\n
  \ * added BitLayout\n\n## 0.1.1.0 *March 2018*\n  * added functions `bvMulFS`/`bvMulFU`
  for full bitvector\n    multiplication without truncation\n  * removed Internal
  module, now export all those functions in Data.BitVector.Sized\n  * fixed the bv*WithRepr
  functions, which were not truncating the\n    inputs properly\n\n## 0.1.0.0 *March
  2018*\n  * First release\n"
