changelog: " 0.8.2 to 0.9.0:\n  \n  * Improvements to handling pitch bend. The value
  of pitch \n    bend is now represented as a Word14 and it is encoded\n    and decoded
  according to the MIDI spec (previously it\n    was left uninterpreted).\n    Thanks
  to Joachim Tilsted Kristensen.\n\n  * Removed ZMidi.Core.VersionNumber file. This
  means we can \n    have a vanilla Setup.hs file.\n\n0.8.1 to 0.8.2:\n\n  * Updated
  to compile with ghc-8.4. Thanks to Evan Laforge.\n\n0.8.0 to 0.8.1:\n\n  * Fixed
  error with missing CPP directive in ZMidi.Core.Pretty.\n\n\n0.7.0 to 0.8.0:\n\n
  \ * Updated to compile without errors with GHC 7.10.\n\n\n0.6.0 to 0.7.0:\n\n  *
  Changed @ChannelPrefix@ constructor to have a single \n    argument - channel number
  (previously it stored a constant \n    tag 0x01 as well as channel number).\n\n
  \ * Added @SysExCont@ and @SysExEscape@ constructors to the \n    @MidiSysExEvent@
  data type.\n\n  * Added new pretty printers - @Csv@ based on @midicsv@ and \n    @Ascii@
  based on the ASCII MIDI representation in the book \n    Beyond Midi (the zmidi
  ASCII representation is simplified).\n    The demo application @MidiPrint@ now allows
  choice of pretty\n    printer.\n\n  * @printMidiHeader@ and @printMidiTrack@ from
  @Pretty@ changed\n    to MidiFiles as arguments, @printMidi@ has now become \n    @putMidi@.\n\n\n0.5.0
  to 0.6.0:\n  \n  * Extended the parser and changed the syntax tree to interpret
  \n    MIDI Running Status. \n   \n  * Added a module @ZMidi.Core.Canonical@ to translate
  MidiFiles\n    to a canonical form where any shorthand NoteOff introduced by \n
  \   Running Status is expanded to regular NoteOn and NoteOff \n    events (with
  Running Status set, MidiFiles can signal NoteOff \n    events as another NoteOn
  with 0 channel velocity).\n  \n  * Added a hack to the pretty printer to stop printing
  ASCII\n    chars greater than 164 causing an error when printing to \n    stdout.\n
  \ \n\n0.4.0 to 0.5.0:\n\n  * Changed order of @MidiVoiceEnvent@ constructors so
  the Ord \n    instance follows the order of the /tag/ in the MIDI binary\n    representation.\n
  \n  * Changed @MidiSysCommonEvent@ to have different constructors \n    for unidentified
  F4 anf F5 events.   \n\n  * Changed @MidiSysRealTimeEvent@ to have different constructors\n
  \   for unidentified F9 and FD events.  \n\n  * Added more Haddock docs.\n\n  *
  Various internal code changes.\n\n\n0.3.0 to v0.4.0:\n\n  * Added new constructors
  to @MidiMetaEvent@ for MidiPort and \n    MetaOther. MetaOther recognizes otherwise
  unrecognized events\n    improving the robustness of the parser. Similarly a new
  \n    /other/ constructor has been added to @MidiScaleType@ to \n    avoid parse
  errors.\n\n\n0.2.1 to 0.3.0:\n\n  * Revised naming of the MIDI data types. All data
  types now have \n  the prefix Midi (previously only MidiFile followed this scheme).\n
  \ The rationale for this is client software, that might want a \n  higher-level
  representation, is then free to use the more \n  generic names Track, Message, etc.\n\n
  \ * @DeltaTime@ made a newtype wrapper rather than a type synonym.\n\n  * Renamed
  the pretty print functions @track@ to @printMidiTrack@ \n    and @header@ to @printMidiHeader@.\n\n
  \ * Moved internal dataypes (SplitByte, Varlen) into a private \n    module.\n\n0.2.0
  to 0.2.1:\n\n  * Added Show class constraints to various type signatures to \n    accommodate
  changes to Num superclass hierarchy in GHC 7.4.\n    Thanks to Rémy Mouëza for the
  patches.\n\n0.1.0 to 0.2.0:\n\n  * Added a top-level /shim/ module to import all
  the exposed\n    modules. Added a version number module\n\n0.1.0:\n\n  * Initial
  release.\n"

  Minimalist library to read and write MIDI files, with
  dependencies only on ByteString, Containers and Data.Binary.

  Changelog:

  v0.8.2 to v0.9.0:

  * Improvements to handling pitch bend. The value of pitch
  bend is now represented as a Word14 and it is encoded
  and decoded according to the MIDI spec (previously it
  was left uninterpreted).
  Thanks to Joachim Tilsted Kristensen.

  * Removed ZMidi.Core.VersionNumber file. This means we can
  have a vanilla Setup.hs file.

  v0.8.1 to v0.8.2:

  * Updated to compile with ghc-8.4. Thanks to Evan Laforge.

  v0.8.0 to v0.8.1:
