description: |
  ZeroMQ is a handy way to communicate between applications:

  [Rationale:] Zmcat is an handy command-line tool to debug or communicate
  with ZeroMQ applications from the shell.
  One use of zmcat is to easily audit, monitor, add cron-jobs shell scripts
  which speak zmq.

  [Limitations:]
  A limitation is that Zmcat only supports printable text. Support for
  random binary streams will come later.
