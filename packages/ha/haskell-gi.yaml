synopsis: Generate Haskell bindings for GObject Introspection capable libraries
changelog: |
  ### 0.22.5

  + Add support for inheriting overloading info.

  ### 0.22.4

  + Do not generate bindings for struct/union fields pointing to private/class structs, which we do not bind.

  ### 0.22.3

  + Sometimes struct fields marked as not introspectable contain invalid introspection info. We are lenient in these cases with parsing errors, and simply ignore the fields.

  ### 0.21.5

  + Add support for callback-valued properties.

  ### 0.21.4

  + Try to guess signedness of enums and flags on the C side, fixes [#184](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/184).

  ### 0.21.3

  + Do not add nodes in overrides if a node with the same name already exists, fixes [#171](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/171).

  ### 0.21.2

  + Do not free `Ptr Word8` types after performing the call to C,
  since they only get passed along. Otherwise one could easily double free in functions such as [GdkPixbuf.pixbufNewFromData](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gi-gdkpixbuf/docs/GI-GdkPixbuf-Objects-Pixbuf.html#v:pixbufNewFromData).

  + Fix a leak on optional `ScopeTypeAsync` callbacks.

  ### 0.20.4

  + Improve marshaling of array arguments with no specified size. This improves the generated bindings for various functions, for instance [`GObject.signalEmitv`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gi-gobject/docs/GI-GObject-Functions.html#v:signalEmitv).

  + Replace the enable-overloading flags with a explicit CPP check of the version of `haskell-gi-overloading` we are being compiled against, see [issue 124](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/124) for the rationale.

  ### 0.20.3

  + Make the overloading code protected by a CPP conditional, depending on ENABLE_OVERLOADING being defined. See [issue 107](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/107).

  + Wrap boxed structs/unions as transient [ManagedPtr](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskell-gi-base/docs/Data-GI-Base-BasicTypes.html#t:ManagedPtr)s in callbacks. This is needed to fix a number of issues, including [issue 96](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/96) and [issue 97](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/97).

  ### 0.20.2

  + Fixes for GHC 8.2.1.

  ### 0.20.1

  + gtk-doc parser and haddock generator: while by no means perfect,
  now the autogenerated bindings come with some reasonable
  autogenerated documentation.

  + Many bugfixes. A particularly important one is for
  [issue 82](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/82), which
  made compilation of
  [gi-glib](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/gi-glib) fail, for
  the latest version of gobject-introspection.

  Generate Haskell bindings for GObject Introspection capable libraries. This includes most notably
  Gtk+, but many other libraries in the GObject ecosystem provide introspection data too.
