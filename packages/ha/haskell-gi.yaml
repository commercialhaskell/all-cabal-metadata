synopsis: Generate Haskell bindings for GObject Introspection capable libraries
changelog: |
  ### 0.24.5

  + Fix an accidental double free for GValues, see [issue 320](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/320).

  + Accept docsections in gir files, although they are currently ignored. See [issue 318](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/318).

  ### 0.24.4

  + Relax bound on ansi-terminal.

  ### 0.24.3

  + Provide type init functions for GParamSpec types. This solves a puzzling linker error saying that the "intern" symbol could not be resolved, see [issue 297](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/297) and [issue 298](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/298).

  ### 0.24.2

  + Support for allocating GArrays of known size structs in caller-allocates arguments.

  ### 0.24.1

  + Add support for delete-attr override, to remove attributes.

  + Allow (but ignore) destroyers in scope async callbacks.

  ### 0.24.0

  + Added support for non-GObject objects

  ### 0.23.2

  + Fix a possible segfault in functions that return an out pointer to a dynamically allocated array, but do not initialize the array if it has zero size. See [#289](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/289) for an example.

  ### 0.23.1

  + Check whether symbols exist in the dynamic library before trying to generate bindings for them, in order to avoid linker errors.

  ### 0.23.0

  + gobjectType now does not require a proxy argument, it needs to be used with TypeApplications instead.

  + Annotated signals are supported: `on widget (signal ::: "detail")`.

  + Safe coercions to parent types supported, with `asA`.

  + Support for GObject subclassing, and registering custom properties.

  + Use TypeApplications in `AttrInfo` implementation, and inherited methods implementation.

  + Add an allocating setting operator `(:&=)`.

  + Support for exporting class structs.

  + IsGValue instances for GObjects and boxed objects.

  ### 0.22.6

  + Fix generated IsX typeclasses for non-GObject interfaces.

  ### 0.22.5

  + Add support for inheriting overloading info.

  ### 0.22.4

  + Do not generate bindings for struct/union fields pointing to private/class structs, which we do not bind.

  ### 0.22.3

  + Sometimes struct fields marked as not introspectable contain invalid introspection info. We are lenient in these cases with parsing errors, and simply ignore the fields.

  ### 0.21.5

  + Add support for callback-valued properties.

  ### 0.21.4

  + Try to guess signedness of enums and flags on the C side, fixes [#184](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/184).

  ### 0.21.3

  + Do not add nodes in overrides if a node with the same name already exists, fixes [#171](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/171).

  ### 0.21.2

  + Do not free `Ptr Word8` types after performing the call to C,
  since they only get passed along. Otherwise one could easily double free in functions such as [GdkPixbuf.pixbufNewFromData](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gi-gdkpixbuf/docs/GI-GdkPixbuf-Objects-Pixbuf.html#v:pixbufNewFromData).

  + Fix a leak on optional `ScopeTypeAsync` callbacks.

  ### 0.20.4

  + Improve marshaling of array arguments with no specified size. This improves the generated bindings for various functions, for instance [`GObject.signalEmitv`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gi-gobject/docs/GI-GObject-Functions.html#v:signalEmitv).

  + Replace the enable-overloading flags with a explicit CPP check of the version of `haskell-gi-overloading` we are being compiled against, see [issue 124](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/124) for the rationale.

  ### 0.20.3

  + Make the overloading code protected by a CPP conditional, depending on ENABLE_OVERLOADING being defined. See [issue 107](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/107).

  + Wrap boxed structs/unions as transient [ManagedPtr](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskell-gi-base/docs/Data-GI-Base-BasicTypes.html#t:ManagedPtr)s in callbacks. This is needed to fix a number of issues, including [issue 96](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/96) and [issue 97](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/97).

  ### 0.20.2

  + Fixes for GHC 8.2.1.

  ### 0.20.1

  + gtk-doc parser and haddock generator: while by no means perfect,
  now the autogenerated bindings come with some reasonable
  autogenerated documentation.

  + Many bugfixes. A particularly important one is for
  [issue 82](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/82), which
  made compilation of
  [gi-glib](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/gi-glib) fail, for
  the latest version of gobject-introspection.
