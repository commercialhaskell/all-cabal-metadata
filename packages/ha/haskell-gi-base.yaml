changelog: ! '### 0.21.1


  + Remove the `::=` and `::~` constructors in `AttrOp`, since they cannot really
  be used for anything, since they are pure functions.


  ### 0.21.0


  + New release to keep major version parity with the `haskell-gi` package, no changes
  otherwise.


  ### 0.20.8


  + Fix a bug which could lead to crashes when releasing boxed objects, see [issue
  #130](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/130).


  ### 0.20.7


  + Fix a memory leak in doConstructGObject.


  ### 0.20.6


  + Use g_object_new_with_properties instead of g_object_newv in

  GLib versions 2.54 or later, to avoid a deprecation warning.


  ### 0.20.5


  + Run object finalizers in the main loop. The reason is that for

  some types the destructor is not thread safe, and assumes that it

  is being run from the same thread as the thread that created the object,

  which can lead to crashes when using the threaded runtime.


  ### 0.20.4


  + Better error diagnostics for [wrapObject](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskell-gi-base/docs/Data-GI-Base-ManagedPtr.html#v:wrapObject)
  and [newObject](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskell-gi-base/docs/Data-GI-Base-ManagedPtr.html#v:newObject).


  ### 0.20.3


  + Fixes for GHC 8.2.1 (and the corresponding `base-4.10.0`).


  ### 0.20.2


  + Fix fromGVariant for empty arrays, see [#91](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/91)
  for details.


  ### 0.20.1


  + Add Data.GI.Base.CallStack, abstracting (and backporting to the

  extent possible) the `HasCallStack` constraint present in newer

  GHCs. Using this, we now include callstacks pervasively in the

  generated code.


  + Improve the `WrappedPtr` implementation.


  + Deprecate `nulltoNothing`, it is better to simply fix the

  overrides when necessary.


  + Make the semantics of GObject ownership transfer closer to those used by the Python
  bindings.
