description: ! 'A command line application that computes file hashes traversing recursively

  through a directory structure.


  The known hashes can be used to audit the same directory structure or a copy

  of it.


  Execute haskdeep without arguments and it will show you the help text:


  > user@host:~$ haskdeep

  >

  >  Usage: haskdeep COMMAND [-c|--computation MODE] [-r|--root DIRNAME] [-k|--known
  FILENAME]

  >    Computes hashes and audit a set of files

  >

  >  Available options:

  >    -h,--help                Show this help text

  >    -v,--version             Show version information

  >    -c,--computation MODE    md5 | sha1 | sha256 | skein512 - default md5

  >    -r,--root DIRNAME        Root directory - default current directory

  >    -k,--known FILENAME      Known hashes file - default known.haskdeep

  >    -e,--excl-regex REGEX    Exclude files or directories based on regex

  >    -f,--incl-mod-from DATE  Include files modified from yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ

  >    -t,--incl-mod-upto DATE  Include files modified up to yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ

  >  Available commands:

  >    compute                  Computes file hashes and saves them to known hashes
  file

  >    audit                    Audits files comparing them to known hashes


  Default usage:


  1. create known hashes of files contained in a root directory (traversed recursively)


  >  user@host:~$ haskdeep compute -c md5 -r myimportantfiles/ -k knownhashes.txt
  -e "tmp|\.log"


  2. verify a copy of the same files comparing them with known hashes


  >  user@host:~$ haskdeep audit -c md5 -r copyofmyimportantfiles/ -k knownhashes.txt
  -e "tmp|\.log"
