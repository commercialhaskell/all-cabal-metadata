  # Haverer

  Haverer is a simple implementation of the excellent card game,
  [Love Letter](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/129622/love-letter).

  It follows the original Japanese rules, rather than the newer American ones.

  ## Running

  At the moment, you'll need to compile from source, which means you'll need to
  get set up with `cabal`. The easiest way to do this is to install the
  [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/).

  Once you've done that, run the following commands:

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/jml/haverer.git
  $ cd haverer
  $ cabal sandbox init
  $ cabal configure
  $ cabal install --dependencies-only
  $ cabal run
  ```

  That last command, `cabal run`, will run a command-line version of the game.

  This code is copyright Jonathan M. Lange, 2014-2015, and is made available
  under the Apache License, version 2.0. See LICENSE for details.

  ## Roadmap

  0. Procrastinate endlessly learning new Haskell tricks
  1. Wrap this whole thing in an API server
  2. Make that server available to the public
  3. Put a nice-ish web frontend in front

  ## Bugs

  Please file issues on the
  [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/jml/haverer/issues)

  ## Patches

  Are most welcome.

  ## History

  The original implementation of this game is called
  [loveletter](https://github.com/jml/loveletter) and is written in
  [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/).
