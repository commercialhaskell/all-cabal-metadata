  understands all syntax understood by GHC 6.8.2\n\n  * Haddock can generate documentation
  for some of the language extensions\n    in GHC 6.8.2\n\n  * Format of module attributes
  has changed. The only way of specifiying\n    module attributes is via a new OPTIONS_HADDOCK
  pragma. Example: \n    {-# OPTIONS_HADDOCK hide, prune #-}\n\n  * Haddock understands

  version\n\n  * Remove --use-package, --allow-missing-html, --ghc-pkg, in favour
  of only\n    supporting --read-interface\n\n  * Remove --package flag, the GHC flag

  GHC flag -XNoImplicitPrelude can\n    be used instead\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChanges
  in version 0.9:\n\n  * Infix type operators, e.g., first :: a~>a' -> (a,b)~>(a',b)\n\n
  \ * Add a search box to the index page which automatically narrows\n    the index
  to the search as you type (thanks to Neil Mitchell).\n\n  * Add a --ghc-pkg flag\n\n
  \ * Add a flag --allow-missing-html\n\n  * URL expansion for %%, %L, %{LINE}\n\n
  \ * added substitution %{FILE///c}\n\n  * Lexing of /.../ is now more like '...',
  in that a / character must\n    be matched by another / character on the same line,
  otherwise it\n    is treated as a literal '/'.  This removes a common source of\n
  \   accidental parse errors in documentation.\n\n  * Various bugs were fixed.\n\n
  \ * Cabal 1.2 is now required, and Haddock builds with GHC 6.8.x.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChanges
  in version 0.8:\n\n  * Haddock has a Cabal build system, and will build on Windows
  without\n    Cygwin or MSYS.  GHC 6.4 or later is required.\n\n  * New options:
  --comments-base, --comments-module, --comments-entity\n    for generating links
  to pages (eg. wiki) for collecting user comments.\n\n  * New options: --source-base,
  --source-module, --source-entity\n    for generating links to source code.  Haddock
  now understands\n    {-# LINE #-} pragmas, which means it can figure out the correct\n
  \   name for the source file even if the file is preprocessed.\n\n  * Haddock generates
  output for populating the Hoogle search engine.\n\n  * New markup <<url>> for including
  images.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChanges
  in version 0.7:\n\n  * Changes in the way Haddock decides where to direct hyperlinks.
  \ Each entity\n    is now assigned a single \"home\" module, and all hyperlinks
  are directed\n    to that module.  See the docs (\"Hyperlinking and re-exported
  entities\")\n    for details.\n\n  * New options --ignore-all-exports, --hide\n\n
  \ * New option --use-package for creating documentation that hyperlinks to\n    the
  HTML documentation for existing packages on your system.  It works\n    by querying
  ghc-pkg for the location of the Haddock interface and\n    HTML for the given package.\n\n
  \ * Parts of the HTML documentation, notably lists of instances, are\n    now \"collapsible\"
  with a +/- button.  Also, the contents page is now\n    in the form of tree in which
  subtrees can be collapsed.\n\n  * Support for Microsoft DevHelp and HtmlHelp 2.0
  formats.\n\n  * Support for a short description for each module for the contents
  page.\n\n  * Compiles with GHC 6.4+\n\n  * Various bugfixes\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChanges
  in version 0.6:\n\n  * Implicit parameters, zip comprehensions and 'mdo' are now\n
  \   supported by the parser.\n\n  * Some lexical bugs were fixed, mainly concerning
  literal paragraphs\n    next to non-literal paragraphs.\n\n  * New options:  --gen-index,
  --use-index, --gen-contents and --use-contents,\n    for generting a combined index
  and contents for several libraries\n    from the appropriate .haddock files.\n\n
  \ * There is now one index rather than separate Function/Constructor and\n    Type/Class
  indices.  Where a name refers to several entities, these\n    are listed separately
  in the index.\n\n  * New option: -v, elicits more verbose warnings.  Some warnings
  are\n    now turned off by default; Haddock should be a little less noisy\n    in
  general.\n\n  * Markup for definition lists has been added.  See the documentation
  \n    for details.\n\n  * New option: --package for setting the package name.  The
  package\n    is listed alongside each module name in the combined contents.\n\n
  \ * Entities which are re-exported from another package now at least\n    leave
  a hyperlink in the generated HTML, rather than nothing at all.\n\n  * Some fixes
  for bugs which caused incorrect hyperlinks in the\n    generated HTML.  In particular,
  instances should now be linked\n    correctly.\n\n  * Some aesthetic improvements
  to the generated HTML.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChanges
  in version 0.5:\n\n  * Compiles with recent versions of GHC.\n\n  * A few bugs have
  been fixed.\n\n  * New labelling/linking feature (see \"Anchors\" in the manual).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChanges
  in version 0.4:\n\n  * Import declarations which list entities in parentheses, or
  with\n    hiding clauses, are now properly supported.  Modulo one or two\n    small
  infelicities, the full Haskell modules system is now supported.\n\n  * Haddock is
  now more flexible about the placing of separators\n    (commas, semicolons) in relation
  to doc comments.\n\n  * There is support for generating and reading \"interface
  files\"\n    which describe the exports of a set of modules.  This is useful\n    for
  generating documentation which hyperlinks to\n    previously-generated documentation.\n
  \   \n  * Support for generating the extra files required by the Microsoft\n    Help
  compiler.\n\n  * New option: --prologue specifies a file of documentation which
  is\n    placed on the contents page.\n\n  * Many bugs fixed\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChanges
  in version 0.3:\n  \n  * Documentation on individual function arguments is now implemented
  \n  \n  * Links can be made to identifiers that aren't in scope, by using\n    the
  fully qualified name.\n\n  * Instances are collected and listed with the appropriate
  classes\n    and datatypes (not for derived instances yet).\n\n  * Single quotes
  are only interpreted specially when they surround a\n    legal Haskell identifier,
  otherwise they are treated literally.\n\n  * Bird-tracked text is now literal.  If
  you want marked-up text in\n    a code block, use the @...@ notation instead.\n\n
  \ * Various changes to the layout, it generally looks nicer now.\n\n  * Various
  bugs fixed.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChanges
  in version 0.2:\n\n  * The [...] markup for typewriter font has been changed to
  @...@.\n\n  * Module attributes introduced (see the documentation for details).\n\n
  \ * {- ... -} style comments may now be used for documentation annotations\n\n  *
  Recursive modules are detected and reported as an error.\n\n  * Existential constructors
  and rank-N types are now groked by the parser\n\n  * Some type rendering cleaned
  up\n\n  * `abc' is accepted as well as 'abc' to markup an identifier\n\n  * Several
  bugs fixed, and error messages improved.\n"

  Haddock, a Haskell Documentation Tool
  =====================================

  This is Haddock, a tool for automatically generating documentation
  from annotated Haskell source code.  It is primary intended for
  documenting library interfaces, but it should be useful for any kind
  of Haskell code.

  Like other systems ([1],[2]), Haddock lets you write documentation
  annotations next to the definitions of functions and types in the
  source code, in a syntax that is easy on the eye when writing the
  source code (no heavyweight mark-up).  The documentation generated by
  Haddock is fully hyperlinked - click on a type name in a type
  signature to go straight to the definition, and documentation, for
  that type.

  Haddock understands Haskell's module system, so you can structure your
  code however you like without worrying that internal structure will be
  exposed in the generated documentation.  For example, it is common to
  implement a library in several modules, but define the external API by
  having a single module which re-exports parts of these implementation
  modules.  Using Haddock, you can still write documentation annotations
  next to the actual definitions of the functions and types in the
  library, but the documentation annotations from the implementation
  will be propagated to the external API when the documentation is
  generated.  Abstract types and classes are handled correctly.  In
  fact, even without any documentation annotations, Haddock can generate
  useful documentation from your source code.

  Haddock can generate documentation in multiple formats; currently HTML
  is implemented, and there is partial support for generating DocBook.
  The generated HTML uses stylesheets, so you need a fairly up-to-date
  browser to view it properly (Mozilla, Konqueror, Opera, and IE 6
  should all be ok).

  Full documentation can be found in the doc/ subdirectory, in DocBook
  format.
