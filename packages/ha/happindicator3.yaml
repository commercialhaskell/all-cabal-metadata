  # happindicator3

  This project is a fork of the original `happindicator` library which provided
  bindings to Ubuntu's AppIndicator library.

  `happindicator3` uses a simplified build system and is compatible with the
  `gtk3` library, as opposed to `happindicator` which required the older `gtk`
  library.

  While not 100% identical to `happindicator`, the `happindicator3` API has stayed
  largely backwards compatible with the original `happindicator`.

  ## Build Notes

  This package requires `appindicator3-0.1` and its development files to be
  installed.

  The included demo application can be built by passing the "demo" flag to Cabal.

  ## Documentation

  Please refer to the API docs available on Hackage.

  ## Example

  A simple demo application can be found at `demo/Main.hs`.
