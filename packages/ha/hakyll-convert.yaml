changelog: |
  ## 0.3.0.4

  ### Changed
  - Allow tasty 1.3 and 1.4
  - Allow tasty-expected-failure 0.12

  ### Fixed
  - Brittle golden tests for Wordpress (which broke because of an update to the
      "feed" package)


  ## 0.3.0.3

  ### Added
  - Include golden outputs (and inputs) in the source distribution.


  ## 0.3.0.2

  ### Removed
  - Dependency on `datetime`. That package is absent from Stackage, seems
      unmaintained, is licensed under GPL (limiting hakyll-convert's licensing),
      and is easy to replace.


  ## 0.3.0.1

  ### Added
  - CHANGELOG.md is now part of sdist tarball.
  - Cabal file now puts halyll-convert under "Tools" category.

  ### Fixed
  - Version number in the Cabal file.


  ## 0.3.0.0

  ### Added
  - New function, `IO.savePost`, that writes a given post onto the disk, complete
      with a "front matter" understood by Hakyll.

  ### Changed
  - Use `Text` instead of `String` in all public interfaces.

  ### Fixed
  - Comments in modern Blogger backups work again.

description: WordPress and Blogger only let one export posts in a limited number of
  formats, none of which are supported by Hakyll. @hakyll-convert@ is created to bridge
  this gap, providing a way to turn other platform's datadumps into a set of files
  Hakyll understands.
