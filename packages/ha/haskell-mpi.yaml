description: "Haskell-mpi, Haskell bindings to the MPI library\n------------------------------------------------\n\nHow
  to build\n------------\n\nUse \"cabal install --extra-include-dirs=/path/to/mpi/headers
  --extra-lib-dirs=/path/to/mpi/libs\"\nor something similar.  Make sure that you
  have libmpi.a and libmpi.so available.\n\nWhen building against MPICH 1.4, pass
  extra flag \"-fmpich14\"\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nTwo types of tests are provided:\n\n
  \  1. Unit tests.\n   2. Standalone tests.\n\nThe unit tests are designed to test
  the functions exported by the library on\nan individual basis. The standalone tests
  are comprised of complete programs -\nthey act as simple integration tests, and
  may also include regression tests.\n\nHow to enable testing\n---------------------\n\nAdd
  \"-ftest\" to cabal install:\n\n   cabal -ftest install\n\nHow to run the unit tests\n-------------------------\n\n(Assuming
  you have built haskell-mpi  with -ftest, as described above):\n\nRun the program
  \"haskell-mpi-testsuite\" using \"mpirun\" like so:\n\n  mpirun -np 2 haskell-mpi-testsuite
  1>sender.log 2>receiver.log\n\nProcess with rank 0 emits the output to stdout, and
  every other rank reports\nto the stderr.\n\nIf you are using the PBS batch system
  to launch jobs, there is a sample\njob script in test/pbs/ for submitting the test
  case to the jobs queue.\n\nHow to run standalone tests\n---------------------------\n\nStandalone
  test programs can be found in the test/examples directory.\nYou can test the execution
  of these programs using the shelltestrunner package:\n\n   http://hackage.haskell.org/package/shelltestrunner\n\nMake
  sure you install shelltestrunner first, for example:\n\n   cabal install shelltestrunner\n\nTo
  run the tests, issue this command:\n\n   shelltest --execdir test/examples/\n\nLicense

  software under the terms of the BSD \nLicense (see the file LICENSE in the top directory).\n\nAuthor(s):

  Bernie Pope:\n\n   florbitous <at> gmail <dot> com\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nAround
  the year 2000 Michael Weber released hMPI, a Haskell binding to MPI:\n\n   http://www.foldr.org/~michaelw/hmpi/\n\nDevelopment
  on that code appears to have stopped in about the year 2001.\nHal Daumé III picked
  up the code and got it working with (at the time)\na more recent version of GHC:\n\n
  \  http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/software.html\n\nIn February 2010 both Michael
  and Hal reported that they had not worked on\nthe code for a long time, so it was
  open for new maintainers.\n\nIn early 2010 Bernie Pope downloaded the above mentioned
  versions of\nhMPI and tried to get them working with a modern GHC.\n\nA few things
  had changed in Haskell since hMPI was written, which suggested\nthat it might be
  worth starting the binding from scratch. In particular\nthe FFI had changed in a
  few ways, the C2HS tool had matured substantially,\nand good quality serialization
  libraries had emerged. So while haskell-mpi\nis highly inspired by hMPI (which was
  very good code),\nit is almost entirely a rewrite.\n\nHaskell-mpi got its first
  main injection of effort during the inaugural\nAusHac Australian Haskell Hackathon,
  hosted at UNSW from the 16th to the\n18th of July 2010. The end result was a proof
  of concept.\n\nThe next major injection of effort happened when Dmitry Astapov started\ncontributing
  to the project in August 2010.\n\nContributions have also been made by:\n\n   -
  Abhishek Kulkarni: support for MPI-2 intercommunicator client/server\n     functions
  \n   - Andres Löh: bug fixes\n   - Ian Ross: updated the code to work with newer
  C2HS.\n"
