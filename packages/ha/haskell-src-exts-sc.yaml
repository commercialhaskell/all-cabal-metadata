  # haskell-src-exts-sc

  The library generates code from `haskell-src-exts` AST.
  The procedure is as follows:

    1. pretty-print AST generated by `haskell-src-exts`
    2. parse the generated code to get `SrcSpanInfo` for each node
    3. combine AST annotated with comments and AST annotated with `SrcSpanInfo`
    4. insert (non-empty) comments into each node, updating `SrcSpanInfo` of all nodes
    5. profit!

  As you can see, the algorithm is nor remarkably fast, because it prints and parses code
  and modifies `SrcSpanInfo` of all nodes in an AST on each comment insertion.
  On the good side, it is quite flexible and compatible with many versions of `haskell-src-exts`.
  Performance is also acceptable if you don't need to invoke it every millisecond.
