  # haskell-src-exts-simple

  ## Synopsis

  This package provides a shim for haskell-src-exts, exposing the same
  AST but without annotations, using ghc's pattern synonyms.

  This package is useful for synthesizing and manipulating HSE ASTs
  that don't carry source location information. It may also aid
  in porting packages from haskell-src-exts 1.17 to 1.18, but it
  is *not* a drop-in replacement for the old annotation-free AST.
  See the Compatibility section for details.

  ## Versioning

  To be able to track the haskell-src-exts version numbers conveniently,
  the first *three* components of the version will be treated as the
  major version, followed by the minor version as usual. This deviates
  from the PVP.

  ## Compatibility

  Since version 1.18, haskell-src-exts-simple has followed the changes in
  haskell-src-exts, without any attempt to keep backward compatibility.

  ### Comparison to haskell-src-exts 1.17 (as of version 1.18):

  haskell-src-exts-simple provides a simplified view of the annotated
  AST in haskell-src-exts, so there are differences to the unannotated
  AST provided by earlier versions of haskell-src-exts:

  * some constructors carried `SrcLoc` information, which is no longer
    available, notably
    - most constructors of the `Decl`, `ModulePragma`, `ImportDecl`,
     `IPBind`, `ClassDecl`, `InstDecl`, `QualConDecl`, `GadtDecl`
      datatypes
    - the `Lambda`, `ExpTypeSig` and `Proc` constructors of the `Exp`
      type (and a few XML related ones)
    - the `Generator` constructor of `Stmt`
    - the `Alt` constructor of `Alt`
    - the `PatTypeSig` constructor of `Pat`
  * the second, fourth and fifth fields of the `Module` constructor have
    been combined into a single field of type `ModuleHead`

  (this list is probably incomplete)

  ### ghc compatibility

  * haskell-src-exts-simple requires ghc-8.0 or later
