changelog: "* Hackage: (http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hArduino)\n* GitHub:  (http://leventerkok.github.com/hArduino)\n\n*
  Latest Hackage released version: 1.2\n\n### Version 1.2, 2022-12-14\n * Make hArduino
  compile with recent versions of GHC\n\n### Version 1.1, 2016-03-27\n * Unfortunately
  the Firmata project moved on, and hArduino no longer\n   works with the latest release
  of StandardFirmata. This release mainly\n   makes a note of this fact, and points
  to an older version of StandardFirmata\n   that hArduino has been tested against.
  Volunteers encouraged to\n   contribute to bring hArduino up-to-date: Contact me
  if interested!\n\n   In the mean-time, use the following version of StandardFirmata,
  which is\n   known to work with hArduino: (http://github.com/LeventErkok/hArduino/blob/master/StandardFirmata/StandardFirmata.ino)\n\n
  * Make the pin-capabilities code robust, by explicitly catching\n   (and ignoring)
  capabilities we do not know/care about. Previously\n   we were simply using toEnum,
  which choked with new versions\n   of Firmata as they added new options. Thanks
  to Can Akcura on\n   Github for pointing out the issue.\n\n\n### Version 0.9, 2014-02-09\n
  * Added example program for Morse encoding.\n   Original idea by Antoine Dumont.
  Thanks!\n\n### Version 0.8, 2013-12-15\n * Add support for Piezo speakers\n * Add
  simple musical note playing support, and a\n   jingle-bells playing example. (Not
  a great\n   rendering, but still recognizable!)\n\n### Version 0.7, 2013-11-09\n
  * Export LCD type, for ease of programming\n * Added the number guessing game using
  the OSEpp shield.\n   Thanks to David Palmer for lending me his shield to play with!\n\n###
  Version 0.6, 2013-03-08\n\n * Make hArduino Windows friendly by removing dependence\n
  \  on the unix package. Thanks to Andriy Drozdyuk for pointing\n   out the Windows
  compilation issue. (Tested on Windows 7.)\n\n### Version 0.5, 2013-03-07\n \n *
  New hardware components supported:\n     * Shift-registers\n     * Seven-segment
  displays\n     * Servo-motors\n * New examples:\n    * PulseIn: Demonstrates the
  use of reading pulses\n    * PulseOut: Demonstrates the use of sending pulses\n
  \   * Distance: Measure the distance using an HC-SC04 sensor\n    * Seven-segment:
  Display characters on a seven-segment display\n    * Servo: Control a servo board\n
  * New functions:\n     * pulseIn_hostTiming/pulseOut_hostTiming: Send and receive
  pulses.\n         * NB. These functions use host-timing: watch out for accuracy\n
  \    * pulse: Send and receive a digital pulse on a pin.\n         * This function
  is more accurate than the pair above, as\n\t   it uses a custom Firmata command
  to measure the pulse.\n\t   However, you need a custom Firmata version to use this\n\t
  \  function, as the standard version that ships with Arduino\n\t   as of March 2013
  does not support this functionality yet.\n     * time: Measure the time taken by
  an Arduino action\n     * timeOut: Run an action only for the given-time-out\n\n###
  Version 0.4, 2013-03-05\n\n * Bugfix: Remove spurious extra call to user program\n
  * Rework pin assignment logic, making use of analog/digital pins much more clearer.\n
  * Better exception handling\n * Remove threadDelay workaround on the Mac. NB. If
  you are running on OSX, then\n   you need at least GHC 7.6.2!\n  \n### Version 0.3,
  2013-02-10\n\n * Library\n    * Add support for pull-up resistors\n    * Implement
  routines for waiting on digital triggers\n    * Add support for reading analog values
  and setting sampling frequency.\n    * Add support for LCDs (based on the Hitachi
  44780 chip)\n    * Better handling for Ctrl-C interrupts\n * Examples\n    * Counter:
  Use push buttons to count up and down\n    * Analog: Reading analog values\n    *
  LCD: Control an LCD, writing text/glyphs etc\n\n### Version 0.2, 2013-01-28\n\n
  * Library\n    * Rewrite the communication engine\n    * Digital input/output implementation\n
  * Examples\n    * Button: Detecting putton pushes\n\n### Version 0.1, 2013-01-14\n\n
  * Library\n    * Initial design\n    * Created home page at: http://leventerkok.github.com/hArduino
  \n * Examples\n    * Blink: Hello world!\n"
