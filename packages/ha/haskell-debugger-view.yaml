  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

description: |-
  This package provides a class to implement custom debug visualization
  instances for user-defined datatypes, which will be discovered and used by
  @haskell-debugger@ when debugging a program. Additionally, it provides a
  handful of built-in custom visualizations, such as for @String@ and @IntMap@.
  The custom debug visualizations are displayed in the editor when inspecting
  a variable or evaluation result. The @'DebugView'@ class is the class for
  which an instance must be provided, and allows one to customize what is
  displayed inline and what fields are available when expanding it.
  See the haddocks of @'GHC.Debugger.View.Class'@ for further information.
