  # hashrename
  ## Rename every file in a directory with its SHA1 hash.

  hashrename is a small program to that renames every file in a given
  directory by using (a portion) of its SHA1 hash. To clean up a messy
  directory call `hashrename <path>` or just `hashrename` to use the current one.

  ### Example

  ```
  $ hashrename ~/mid
  Renaming files in /home/rnhmjoj/mid
  Fugue in G Minor.mid -> 55474B5604.mid
  Eine Kleine Nachtmusik (Lute).mid -> D229488066.mid
  Moonlight Sonata 3rd Movement.mid -> EDB36A19CA.mid
  Sonata Zapateado.mid -> F69717BF11.mid
  Eine Kleine Nachtmusik (Harp).mid -> 9E0A082FB8.mid
  Canon In D.mid -> 550C9091B5.mid
