description: |-
  Haskell Types with Extensions (HTE, haskell-type-exts)
  is (an embryo of) a type checker for Haskell as embodied
  syntactically by the haskell-src-exts (HSE) package.
  At this point the type checker only handles a limited
  number of extensions, both regarding the various syntactic
  extensions handled by HSE, and the various type-level
  extensions implemented in e.g. GHC. The goal is to
  cover the full range of known Haskell extensions,
  but every path starts with a first step.
