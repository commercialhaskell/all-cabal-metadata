changelog: ! "# Changes in version 2.0.1.0\n\n  * Exported MemoVar from Haxl.Core.Memo\n
  \ * Updated the facebook example\n  * Fixed some links in the documentation\n  *
  Bump some version bounds\n\n# Changes in version 2.0.0.0\n\n  * Completely rewritten
  internals to support arbitrarily overlapping\n    I/O and computation.  Haxl no
  longer runs batches of I/O in\n    \"rounds\", waiting for all the I/O to complete
  before resuming the\n    computation. In Haxl 2, we can spawn I/O that returns results
  in\n    the background and computation fragments are resumed when the\n    values
  they depend on are available.  See\n    `tests/FullyAsyncTest.hs` for an example.\n\n
  \ * A new `PerformFetch` constructor supports the new concurrency\n    features:
  `BackgroundFetch`. The data source is expected to call\n    `putResult` in the background
  on each `BlockedFetch` when its\n    result is ready.\n\n  * There is a generic
  `DataSource` implementation in\n    `Haxl.DataSource.ConcurrentIO` for performing
  each I/O operation\n    in a separate thread.\n\n  * Lots of cleanup and refactoring
  of the APIs.\n\n  * License changed from BSD+PATENTS to plain BSD3.\n\n# Changes
  in version 0.5.1.0\n\n  * 'pAnd' and 'pOr' were added\n  * 'asyncFetchAcquireRelease'
  was added\n  * 'cacheResultWithShow' was exposed\n  * GHC 8.2.1 compatibility\n\n#
  Changes in version 0.5.0.0\n  * Rename 'Show1' to 'ShowP' ([#62](https://github.com/facebook/Haxl/issues/62))\n\n#
  Changes in version 0.3.0.0\n\n  * Some performance improvements, including avoiding
  quadratic\n    slowdown with left-associated binds.\n\n  * Documentation cleanup;
  Haxl.Core is the single entry point for the\n    core and engine docs.\n\n  * (>>)
  is now defined to be (*>), and therefore no longer forces\n    sequencing.  This
  can have surprising consequences if you are\n    using Haxl with side-effecting
  data sources, so watch out!\n\n  * New function withEnv, for running a sub-computation
  in a local Env\n\n  * Add a higher-level memoization API, see 'memo'\n\n  * Show
  is no longer required for keys in cachedComputation\n\n  * Exceptions now have `Eq`
  instances\n"

description: ! "![Haxl Logo](https://github.com/facebook/Haxl/raw/master/logo.png)\n\n#
  Haxl\n\nHaxl is a Haskell library that simplifies access to remote data, such\nas
  databases or web-based services. Haxl can automatically\n\n * batch multiple requests
  to the same data source,\n * request data from multiple data sources concurrently,\n
  * cache previous requests,\n * memoize computations.\n\nHaving all this handled
  for you behind the scenes means that your\ndata-fetching code can be much cleaner
  and clearer than it would\notherwise be if it had to worry about optimizing data-fetching.
  We'll\ngive some examples of how this works in the pages linked below.\n\nThere
  are two Haskell packages here:\n\n * `haxl`: The core Haxl framework\n * `haxl-facebook`
  (in [example/facebook](example/facebook)): An (incomplete) example data source for
  accessing the Facebook Graph API\n\nTo use Haxl in your own application, you will
  likely need to build one or more\n*data sources*: the thin layer between Haxl and
  the data that you want\nto fetch, be it a database, a web API, a cloud service,
  or whatever.\n\nThere is a generic datasource in \"Haxl.DataSource.ConcurrentIO\"
  that\ncan be used for performing arbitrary IO operations concurrently, given\na
  bit of boilerplate to define the IO operations you want to perform.\n\nThe `haxl-facebook`
  package shows how we might build a Haxl data\nsource based on the existing `fb`
  package for talking to the Facebook\nGraph API.\n\n## Where to go next?\n\n * [The
  Story of Haxl](https://code.facebook.com/posts/302060973291128/open-sourcing-haxl-a-library-for-haskell/)\n
  \  explains how Haxl came about at Facebook, and discusses our\n   particular use
  case.\n\n * [An example Facebook data source](https://github.com/facebook/Haxl/blob/master/example/facebook/readme.md)
  walks\n   through building an example data source that queries the Facebook\n   Graph
  API concurrently.\n\n * [Fun with Haxl (part 1)](https://simonmar.github.io/posts/2015-10-20-Fun-With-Haxl-1.html)\n
  \  Walks through using Haxl from scratch for a simple SQLite-backed\n   blog engine.\n\n
  * [The N+1 Selects Problem](https://github.com/facebook/Haxl/blob/master/example/sql/readme.md)
  explains how Haxl\n   can address a common performance problem with SQL queries
  by\n   automatically batching multiple queries into a single query,\n   without
  the programmer having to specify this behavior.\n\n * [Haxl Documentation](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haxl)
  on\n   Hackage.\n\n * [There is no Fork: An Abstraction for Efficient, Concurrent,
  and Concise Data Access](http://community.haskell.org/~simonmar/papers/haxl-icfp14.pdf),
  our paper on Haxl, accepted for publication at ICFP'14.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/Haxl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/Haxl)\n"
