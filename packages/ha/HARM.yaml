description: |-
  HARM is a simple ARM emulator written in haskell, with the intention of teaching students about assembly and how CPU's work. It was written by Jeffrey A. Meunier at the University of Connecticut for the 2000 "CSE240 Intermediate Computer Systems" course.

  It is advised that you go to http://www.engr.uconn.edu/~jeffm/Classes/CSE240-Spring-2001/index.html and work through the syllabus if you want to understand how the project got to where it is. I have updated most of it to work in GHC with the changes that have been made since it was originally written.

  Included are two programs, p1.arm and p2.arm which demonstrate the syntax used in the machines. To run there, you can use runarm in ~/.cabal/bin, and dbgarm to debug the assembly.

  If you have any questions, email me at axman6@gmail.com and I'll see what I can do for you.
