description: |-
  Just pick which parts of your data structures you want indexed
  using an easy to use template-haskell function. Spare yourself the
  need to write, run, and maintain code that marshalls your data
  to/from an external relational database just for efficient
  queries. happstack-ixset relies on generics and TH to spare you
  the boilerplate normally required for such tasks.
