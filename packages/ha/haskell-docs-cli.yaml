  # haskell-docs-cli

  This package allows you to perform [Hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org/) searches and to
  navigate [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/) documentation from the command
  line.

  Staying in the command line avoids switching to and from the browser, makes it
  easier to seach a documentation page, jumping through its content, and to view
  the source code of libraries.

  Read more about the rationale [here](https://lazamar.github.io/haskell-documentation-in-the-command-line/).

  ## Installation

  Download the project and run `stack install`.

  It will make the `hdc` executable available in your path.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/lazamar/haskell-docs-cli.git
  cd haskell-docs-cli
  stack install
  ```

  ## Functionalities

  ### Search using Hoogle

  Just like in Hoogle, just type a function name or
  signature to search for matching entries in all of Hackage.

  You can select an option by typing its number or by searching for its name with
  `/`.

  Press `Enter` to view the contents of the current context (search, module or
  package) again. If in a search context, pressing `Enter` you will see the
  results again. The current context is displayed in the line above the prompt.

  ### View documentation

  Use `:mdocumentation` (or `md` for short) to view documentation about a module.
  It will show you the documentation for the first module to match a Hoogle search
  for the term you type. As this is a Hoogle search, you can use `+<package name>`
  to specify the package if you want, like in Hoogle itself.

  Use `:pdocumentation` (or `pd` for short) to view documentation about a package.

  ### View interfaces

  Use `:minterface` (or `:mi`) to view all functions, types, aliases and classes
  exported by a module.

  Use `pinterface` (or `:pi`) to view the modules contained in a package.

  You can navigate further into the options by selecting them by number, or by
  name with `/`.

  ### Navigate the source code

  You can view the source code of a search result with `:src <selector>` where
  the selector is either the result number or a filter term prefixed by `/`.

  If you type `:src` and a search term, `haskell-doc-cli` will load the source of
  the first Hoogle result that is not a module or package.

  ## Contributing

  Contributions are very welcome. Here are some things that would be nice to have:

  - Fix more edge cases
  - Windows compatibility
