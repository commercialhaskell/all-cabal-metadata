description: Perform IO actions during transactions for Hasql. If you need transactions
  in hasql but do not need to perform IO in the middle of the transaction, use haslq-transaction.
  This packages differs from hasql-transaction in that it sacrifices invisible retries
  for the ability to perform arbitrary IO in the middle of a transaction. This is
  beneficial when your transaction is long-lived (e.g. when using cursors) and you
  wish to perform IO with requested data. See <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hasql-streams-core
  hasql-streams-core> for an example use case.
