description: ! 'This is an early and mostly undocumented release of the 2.x version
  of

  hackage-db that''s intended mostly for experimenting with and testing of the

  new API. Porting code from 1.x to 2.x is pretty simple, but if you do that at

  this point, please expect minor details of this API to change in forthcoming

  releases.


  Check out https://github.com/peti/hackage-db/tree/master/example/ for a

  collection of simple example programs that demonstrate how to use this code.'
