  - More sensible determination of TH version available

  0.5.1.1:
  - View pattern support, thanks to Nicolas Frisby.

  0.5.1:
  - New module Language.Haskell.Meta.Parse.Careful, written by Reiner Pope
    so that ambiguous parses can be rejected instead of quietly done wrong.

  0.4:
  - Remove Language.Haskell.Meta.Syntax.Vars and the L.H.M.Syntax re-export module
  - Remove dependency on containers
  - Add support for let statements in (pattern) guards
  - Add support for negative patterns
  - Remove "support" for SpliceExps that didn't really make sense
  - Improve many error messages where things are unimplemented or impossible

  0.3:
  - Fixes/additions to inline pragma support (Jonas Duregard)
  - Compatibility with GHC 7 and TH 2.5 - totalling three major versions!
  - Move some of the quasiquoters to their own package, and stop exporting
    the rest (they are kept as examples of usage)

  0.2:
  - Compatibility with GHC 6.10 and TH 2.3 (Geoffrey Mainland)
  - Add support for do-blocks, pattern guards (Adam Vogt)

  - Used the th-lift library to autogenerate the instances of Lift in
    Language.Haskell.TH.Instances.Lift
  - Added support for the new features of template-haskell-2.4.0.0:
    contexts, kinds, bang patterns, unboxed word literals.
  - Updated use of haskell-src-exts in response to API changes.

  The `haskell-src-meta` Package  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/haskell-src-meta.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskell-src-meta) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DanBurton/haskell-src-meta.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/DanBurton/haskell-src-meta)
  ==================

  `haskell-src-meta` is a package originally by Matt Morrow for converting a
  parsed AST from `haskell-src-exts` to a TH AST for use in splices and
  quasiquoters. The last version Matt released before he disappeared from the
  Haskell community was 0.0.6, but by that time his library was already popular,
  so some community members eventually decided to take over maintenance of the
  package, keeping it up to date with the latest versions of TH etc.

  I don't really view this as "my" package so if you want write access to
  the github repository, or you think you could do a better job as
  maintainer, just ask.

  The above was written by Ben Millwood,
  but I (Dan Burton) share the same sentiment.
