description: ! 'Hath is a Haskell program for working with network blocks in CIDR

  notation. When dealing with blocks of network addresses, there are a

  few things that one usually wants to do with them:


  * Create a regular expression matching the CIDR block(s). This is

  because grep will throw up if you feed it CIDR.


  * Combine small blocks into larger ones. For example, if you have two

  consecutive \/24s, they might combine into a larger \/23.


  * View the result of block combination in a useful way.


  * List them.


  Hath has several modes to perform these functions:


  [@Regexed@]

  This computes a (Perl-compatible) regular expression matching

  the input CIDR blocks. It''s the default mode of operation.


  [@Reduced@]

  This combines small blocks into larger ones where possible, and

  eliminates redundant blocks. The output should be equivalent to

  the input, though.


  [@Duped@]

  Shows only the blocks that would be removed by reduce; that is, it

  shows the ones that would get combined into larger blocks or are

  simply redundant.


  [@Diffed@]

  Shows what would change if you used reduce. Uses diff-like

  notation.


  [@Listed@]

  List the IP addresses contained within the given CIDRs.


  /Examples/:


  Compute a (Perl-compatible) regular expression matching

  the input CIDR blocks. It''s the default mode of operation.


  @

  $ echo \"10.0.0.0\/29 10.0.0.8\/29\" | hath

  ((10)\.(0)\.(0)\.(15|14|13|12|11|10|9|8|7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0))

  @


  Combine two \/24s into a \/23:


  @

  $ echo \"10.0.0.0\/24 10.0.1.0\/24\" | hath reduced

  10.0.0.0/23

  @


  List the addresses in 192.168.0.240\/29:


  @

  $ echo 192.168.0.240\/29 | hath listed

  192.168.0.240

  192.168.0.241

  192.168.0.242

  192.168.0.243

  192.168.0.244

  192.168.0.245
