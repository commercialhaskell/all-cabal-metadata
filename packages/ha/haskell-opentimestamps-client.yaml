  This is a Haskell client for OpenTimestamps, providing a command-line utility to interact with the OpenTimestamps network. It's on Hackage here: [haskell-opentimestamps-client](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskell-opentimestamps-client). The client program allows users to:
  *   **Info:** Display information about a timestamp file.
  *   **Stamp:** Create OpenTimestamps for files.
  *   **Prune:** Prune a timestamp file.
  *   **Upgrade:** Upgrade remote calendar timestamps to be locally verifiable.
  *   **Verify:** Verify existing OpenTimestamps files.

  The client uses the `haskell-opentimestamps` library for core OpenTimestamps stuff.

  The project has a number of dependencies, including `cryptonite` for cryptographic operations, `http-client` for making requests to calendar servers and `haskoin-code` and `bitcoin-rpc` to make RPC-calls to a locally running 'blocksonly' pruned Bitcoin node, which is required for **Verification**.

  Also you will need to have a `libsecp256k1` package (Debian: `libsecp256k1-dev`) installed on your Linux distribution (beware: it needs to be < 0.7.x because of deprecated functions in `0.7.x`).

  To build an executable:

  ```sh
  make release
  ```

  Updating version (development reminder):
  - `version: #.#.#.#` in `package.yaml`
  - run `hpack` to regenerate the `.cabal` file
  - Add the version to `CHANGELOG.md`
  - Commit the new version.
  - `git tag -a #.#.#.#` to add a git tag
  - `git push yourorigin #.#.#.#` to push the git tag

  **Work In Progress**...

  There is also a Haskell library for working with OpenTimestamps. It's on Hackage here: [haskell-opentimestamps](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskell-opentimestamps).
