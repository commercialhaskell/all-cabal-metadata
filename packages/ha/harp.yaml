description: |-
  HaRP, or Haskell Regular Patterns, is a Haskell extension
  that extends the normal pattern matching facility with
  the power of regular expressions. This expressive power
  is highly useful in a wide range of areas, including text parsing
  and XML processing. Regular expression patterns in HaRP work over
  ordinary Haskell lists ([]) of arbitrary type. We have implemented
  HaRP as a pre-processor to ordinary Haskell.
