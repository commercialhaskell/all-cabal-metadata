  # haskeme

  This compiler translates Scheme source code written with I-Expressions (indented expressions) into S-Expressions (symbolic expressions).

  ## Usage
  Haskeme can read and write files:

      haskeme --input "program.hss" --output "program.ss"

  Haskeme can also use `StdIn` and `StdOut`:

      cat "program.hss" | haskeme > "program.ss"

  ### Options
  - `-i` or `--input` to specify input file
  - `-o` or `--output` to specify output file

  ## I-Expressions
  I-Expressions are indented expressions and are translated by few simple rules:

  - a new line translates to a new S-Expression
  - same indentation as the expression above translates to a new S-Expression following the prior one
  - more indentation as the expression above translates to a new S-Expression as an argument to the prior one
  - less indentation as the expression above, but still more indentation as another expression above translates to a new S-Expression, while the prior and further indented block gets wrapped in extra parentheses (look at the `let`-example)
  - S-Expression can be mixed in while staying in a single line (look at the example for mixed expressions)
  - full line comments starting with `;` are ignored
  - a new line can be prevented from being turned into an S-Expression by prepending it with `:` after the indent (look at the example for prevented expressions)


  ### Example
  - I-Expressions:

      ```
      define
        f
          lambda
            x
            let
                y
                  * x x
              if
                > x 0
                + y 1
                : #f
      ```

  - S-Expressions:

      ```
      (define
        (f
          (lambda (x)
            (let ((y (* x x)))
              (if (> x 0)
                  (+ y 1)
                  #f)))))
      ```

  - mixed I- and S-Expressions:

      ```
      define
        f
          lambda (x)
            let
                y (* x x)
              if (> x 0)
                 + y 1
                 : #f
      ```
