  DEPRECATED. @handsy@ is a small library mainly for applications which should make some
  operations on remote machines by SSH. It currently provides you:

  * A DSL describing basic system operations('command', 'readFile', 'writeFile' etc.)

  * Two interpreters for running this DSL locally or via SSH('run' and 'runRemote')

  * Some utility functions for common commands('os', 'mkTemp' etc.)

  If you're looking for a shell scripting alternative, look at @turtle@, @shelly@ or
  @shellmate@ packages. @handsy@ is mostly relevant for the ability to apply simple
  commands remotely.
