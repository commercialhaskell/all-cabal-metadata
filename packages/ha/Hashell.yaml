changelog: "\n\tChangelog - Hashell (0.011a -> 0.013a)\n\n   -- Part of the parsing
  is now done with Parsec. \n   Parsec will partially substitute the majority of the
  parsing tasks.\n   -- Added a new exception handler for haskell expressions\n   evaluation.
  This fixes a bug that aborted hashell.\n   -- Added redirection of standard error.\n
  \  -- Fixed 'quit' built-in command bug.\n   -- Added number identifiers to the
  redirections operators.\n   -- Added pre-liminar support for environment variables.\n
  \  The support is contained into its own module.\n   -- Changed (_yet_ again) the
  syntax for sub-process evaluation \n   from '<|proc|>' to '(-proc-)' (without the
  quotes).\n   -- Type constraints for haskell expressions evaluations are now limited\n
  \  to the ':<s,p,n,u>' notation. Values:\n   \t's' String without newline.\n\t'p'
  Non-String with newline.\n\t'n' Non-String without newline.\n\t'u' String with newline.\n
  \  -- The 'execSplitToken' function has been re-written. It is now\n   split into
  several smaller functions and with better exception handling\n   support.\n   --
  Hashell will now automatically read the configuration file with name\n   .hashell_config
  if it exists inside HOME.\n   -- The comments format in the hashell configuration
  file has changed\n   from '*' to '-'.\n   -- The command composition feature was
  removed.\n   -- Others smaller bugs have been fixed too.\n\n\tAuthor: Luis F. Araujo\n\t\tluis@arjox.org\nSat

  Hashell : A Haskell shell
  -----------------------------------------
  Version: 0.014a
  Status: Alpha

  Dependencies:

  *The Glasgow Haskell Compiler
       >= 6.8 <http://haskell.org/ghc>
  *Cabal
       (any version should work fine; <http://haskell.org/cabal>)
  *Parsec
       >= 1.0 <http://www.cs.uu.nl/people/daan/parsec.html>

  You can build and install Hashell like any other Haskell package, through Cabal; the following example installs as the current user to one's ~/bin directory, but to install elsewhere or as root, simply change the directories or remove the --user flags, respectively:

     $ runhaskell Setup configure --verbose=2 --user --prefix=$HOME/bin --datadir=$HOME/bin/share
     $ runhaskell Setup build
     $ runhaskell Setup install --user;

  You need to have Cabal installed in your system.
  Cabal will often be part of your GHC installation, but you can get a stand-alone version of Cabal from <http://haskell.org/cabal>.

  NOTE! The current version of Hashell assumes you have GHC 6.8.2 installed, and that the output of 'ghc --print-libdir' = "/usr/lib/ghc-6.8.2/". If that's not the right directory, you must edit Hashell/Eval.hs and update the constant 'ghcPath'.

  Usage:

     $ hashell

     or

     $ hashell -c <configurationfile>

  You always can use the --help option for further help.

     $ hashell --help

  The syntax is still fluid, but roughly, ';' is a terminator; an expression starting with ':' will be treated as a load-file command; one starting with "quit" will exit Hashell; one starting with "cd" will change the working directory; and an expression enclosed in a "!()" will be passed through the GHC API and evaluated as an arbitrary Haskell expression. All other commands should be treated as programs to be run.
