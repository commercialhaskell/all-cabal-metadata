  The purpose of this library is to generate okay-looking bar plots for you
  without much effort on your part. The style of the plots may change in newer
  releases as we find ways to make them look nicer. If happy-hour generates a plot
  for you that is not aesthetically pleasing, please let us know so that we may
  improve.
