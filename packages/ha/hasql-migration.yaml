  # PostgreSQL Migrations for Haskell

  [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/tvh/hasql-migration.png)](https://travis-ci.org/tvh/hasql-migration)

  Welcome to hasql-migrations, a tool for helping you with
  PostgreSQL schema migrations. This is a port of
  [postgresql-simple-migration](https://github.com/ameingast/postgresql-simple-migration)
  for use with hasql.

  ## Why?
  Database migrations should not be hard. They should be under version control
  and documented in both your production systems and in your project files.

  ## What?
  This library executes SQL/Haskell migration scripts and keeps track of their
  meta information.

  Scripts are be executed exactly once and any changes to scripts will cause
  a run-time error notifying you of a corrupted database.

  The meta information consists of:
  * an MD5 checksum of the executed script to make sure already existing
    scripts cannot be modified in your production system.
  * a time-stamp of the date of execution so you can easily track when a change
    happened.

  This library also supports migration validation so you can ensure (some)
  correctness before your application logic kicks in.

  ## How?
  TODO

  ## Compilation and Tests
  The program is built with the _cabal_ build system. The following command
  builds the library, the standalone binary and the test package.

  ```bash
  cabal configure --enable-tests && cabal build -j
  ```

  To execute the tests, you need a running PostgreSQL server with an empty
  database called _test_. Tests are executed through cabal as follows:

  ```bash
  cabal configure --enable-tests && cabal test
  ```

  To build the project in a cabal sandbox, use the following code:

  ```bash
  cabal sandbox init
  cabal install -j --only-dependencies --enable-tests --disable-documentation
  cabal configure --enable-tests
  cabal test
  ```

  To remove the generated cabal sandbox, use:
  ```bash
  cabal sandbox delete
  ```

  ## To Do
  * Collect executed scripts and check if already executed scripts have been
    deleted.
