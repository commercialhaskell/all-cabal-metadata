  ## Addresses & Balances


  For every address Haskoin Store has a balance object that contains basic statistics
  about the address. These statistics are described below.


  * `confirmed` balance is that which is in the blockchain. Will always be positive
  or zero.

  * `unconfirmed` balance represent aggregate changes done by mempool transactions.
  Can be negative if the transactions currently in the mempool are expected to reduce
  the balance when all of them make it into the blockchain.

  * `outputs` is the count of outputs that send funds to this address. It is just
  a count and not a monetary value.

  * `utxo` is the count of outputs that send funds to this address that remain unspent,
  taking the mempool into account: if spent in the mempool it will *not* count as
  unspent.
