  # hasktags
  A tool to generate tag files for vim and emacs

  What is it for? A tag file is a index containing key items of your project such as
  - function names
  - module names
  - data declarations
  - ...

  So that you can find / jump to them fast.

  ## HOWTO (GENERATING TAG FILES):
  Build hasktags (standard cabal build)

  Ctag format:
  ```bash
  hasktags --ctags .
  ```

  Etag format (used by emacs):
  ```bash
  hasktags --etags .
  ```

  Both formats:
  ```bash
  hasktags --both .
  ```

  *NB:* Generating both tags generates a file called `TAGS` for Emacs, and one called `ctags` for Vim.

  ## HOWTO (USING TAG FILES):
  ### ViM
  ```viml
  let tags+=tagfile " tags,TAGS is the default setting so probably you don't have to do anything
  ```
  `:tjump foo<tab>` or such. See `:h` tags

  You can use a configuration like [this one](../assets/hasktags.vim)
  with [Tagbar](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar) to produce a
  tagbar like this:

  ![Tagbar1](../assets/tagbar1.png?raw=true) ![Tagbar2](../assets/tagbar2.png?raw=true)

  Enormous thanks to Alexey Radkov for the hierarchical design necessary for this usage.

  ### NEdit
  Load the "tags" file using File/Load Tags File.
  Use "Ctrl-D" to search for a tag.

  ### XEmacs/Emacs
  Load the "TAGS" file using "visit-tags-table"
  Use "M-." to search for a tag.

  ### jedit
  There is a plugin.

  ### Tests
  To run the tests, do `cd testcases; sh test.sh`.

  ## History
  In the past this tool was distributed with ghc. I forked and added some
  features.  hasktags itself was moved out of the ghc repository. Then I only
  verified that my fork finds at least as much tags as the one forked by Igloo.

  ## Future
  Things which could be done in the future:
  - make json support optional
  - Marco Túlio Pimenta Gontijo proposed replacing json by aeson because it might
    be faster

  ## Maintainers
  See cabal file

  ## Comments about literate haskell ([lhs][]):
  Alex no longer supports bird style ">", so should we drop support, too?

  having contributed when this repository has been part of ghc
