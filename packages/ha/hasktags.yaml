description: ! "hasktags: a tool to generate tag files for vim and emacs\n\n  What
  is it for? A tag file is a index containing key items of your project such as\n
  \ - function names\n  - module names\n  - data declarations\n  - ...\n\n  so that
  you can find / jump to them fast.\n\nHOWTO (GENERATING TAG FILES):\n  Build hasktags
  (standard cabal build)\n\n  I've been using this bash function or something similar
  for a long time.\n  It may be cumbersome but works:\n\n  runHaskTagsVim() {\n          #
  use --etags instead of --ctags for emacs\n          hasktags --ignore-close-implementation
  --ctags .; sort tags\n  }\n\nHOWTO (USING TAG FILES):\n  VIM: let tags+=tagifle
  \" tags,TAGS is the default setting so probably you don't have to do anything\n
  \      :tjump foo<tab> or such. See :h tags\n  \n  NEdit:\n\tLoad the \"tags\" file
  using File/Load Tags File.\n\tUse \"Ctrl-D\" to search for a tag.\n\n  XEmacs/Emacs:\n\tLoad
  the \"TAGS\" file using \"visit-tags-table\"\n\tUse \"M-.\" to search for a tag.\n\n
  \ jedit:\n        There is a plugin\n\t\n\n\nrun test cases:\n  cd testcases; sh
  test.sh\n\n\nhistory:\nIn the past this tool was distributed with ghc. I forked
  and added some\nfeatures.  hasktags itself was moved out of the ghc repository.
  Then I only\nverified that my fork finds at least as much tags as the one forked
  by Igloo.\n\nThings which could be done in the future:\n- make json support optional\n-
  Marco Túlio Pimenta Gontijo proposed replacing json by aeson because it might\n
  \ be faster\n- write a nice README.md file instead\n\nmaintainers: See cabal file\n\n\ncomments
  about literate haskell (lhs):\n=======================================\nhttp://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Literate_programming\nalex
  no longer supports bird style \">\", so should we drop support, too?\n\ncontributors:\n
  \ Tsuru Capital (github/liyang)\n  Marco Túlio Pimenta Gontijo (github/marcotmarcot)\n
  \ TODO: add all people having contributed before Oct 2012\n  This includes people
  contributing to the darcs repository as well as people\n  having contributed when
  this repository has been part of ghc\n\nrelated work (list taken from announce of
  lushtags:\n  https://github.com/bitc/lushtags\n  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hasktags\n
  \ http://kingfisher.nfshost.com/sw/gasbag/\n  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hothasktags\n
  \ http://majutsushi.github.com/tagbar/\nand probably much more\n"
