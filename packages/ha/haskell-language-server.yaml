  ![gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12473268/103059293-af071f80-4572-11eb-963a-7e76b45f28b9.gif)

  - The eval plugin has been revamped, adding these new features:
    - Tests in both plain comments and Haddock comments
    - For Haddock comments: shows differences between latest and previous result
    - Setup section, executed before every test
    - Execution of a section/group of tests at the time
    - Property testing
    - Setup of GHC extensions
  - A new tactic to generate automatically `Arbitrary` instances has been added to tactic plugin
  - There had been lot of internal changes:
    - ghcide lives now directly in this repository
    - the test suite has been cleaned and improved (continuing the work done in 0.7.0)


  Thanks to all contributors and happy new year!

  ## 0.6.0

  0.6.0 includes two brand new plugins!

  - [Hlint Plugin](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/166): it integrates hlint diagnostics and lets you apply suggestions to fix them.

  ![hls-hlint-demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54035/98731058-6ff38500-239d-11eb-8176-e4f69ef76fc2.gif)

  - [Module Name Plugin](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/480): it makes easier create new modules and modify them, suggesting the appropiate module name as a code lens.

  ![module-name-demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54035/98731198-a7623180-239d-11eb-8af0-73bd32b9b0b2.gif)

  This release also includes many improvements and bug fixes for the tactic plugin (see pull requests authored by @isovector for more details).

  We have updated two essential tools used by the ide:

  - `implicit-hie`: [to fix a bug](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/498) present when loading cabal based projects with executables containing `other-modules`

  - `ghcide`: the ide uses [the just released version 0.5](https://github.com/haskell/ghcide/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#050-2020-10-08) with many bug fixes and improvements, including:
    - code action to remove *all* redundant imports
    - improved support for Template Haskell
    - emit desugarer warnings

  ## 0.5.0

  0.5.0 comes with a new tactics plugin which provides case splitting, homomorphic case splitting, and lambda introduction:

  ![Case splitting](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/307223/92657198-3d4be400-f2a9-11ea-8ad3-f541c8eea891.gif)

  It can even attempt to fully fill a hole!

  The imports lens plugin also learnt a new code action to make all imports explicit:

  ![Explicit imports code action](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2488460/94994815-1a53dd80-0592-11eb-8a12-ec704ae92385.gif)

  There's also plenty of bug fixes, improvements and updates to the underlying tools, including Fourmolu, implicit-hie-cradle and ghcide. [Some of the improvements from ghcide](https://github.com/haskell/ghcide/releases/tag/v0.4.0) include:

  - The entire project is typechecked on load
  - Reverse dependencies of a module are typechecked upon saving
  - Code completion includes local terms
  - Import code actions now also suggest open imports
  - Documentation on hover shows for symbols defined in the same module

  If you're eager to try all this out, haskell-language-server is now also installable via [ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/):

  ```shell
  $ ghcup install hls
  ```

  ## 0.4.0

  0.4.0 introduces the import lens plugin, which can convert your import statements into qualified imports, or into an explicit import list:

  ![Imports code lens](https://imgur.com/pX9kvY4.gif)

  The eval plugin has also learnt two new commands, `:type` and `:kind`:

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications #-}
  foo :: Show a => a -> String
  foo = show

  -- >>> :type foo @Int
  -- foo @Int :: Int -> String

  -- >>> :type +v foo @Int
  -- foo @Int :: Show Int => Int -> String
  ```

  ```haskell
  -- >>> type N = 1
  -- >>> type M = 40
  -- >>> :kind N + M + 1
  -- N + M + 1 :: Nat

  -- >>> type N = 1
  -- >>> type M = 40
  -- >>> :kind N + M + 1
  -- N + M + 1 :: Nat
  ```

  There is now also support for GHC 8.10.2, and a new `haskell-language-server --probe-tools` command to help debug what version of each tool HLS is using.

  ```shell
  $ haskell-language-server --probe-tools
  haskell-language-server version: 0.3.0.0 (GHC: 8.10.1) (PATH: /Users/luke/.cabal/store/ghc-8.10.1/hskll-lngg-srvr-0.3.0.0-7c6d48c3/bin/haskell-language-server)
  Tool versions found on the $PATH
  cabal:  3.2.0.0
  stack:  2.3.3
  ghc:    8.10.2
  ```

  ## 0.3.0

  0.3.0 comes with two new plugins, retrie and fourmolu, provides binaries for
  GHC 8.8.4, and comes with a host of bug fixes.

  The retrie plugin supports RULES, functions and type synonyms which can be
  accessed through contextual code actions.

  Fourmolu can be used to format your code by setting the
  `haskell.formattingProvider` field in your LSP configuration to

  ```json
  {
    "haskell": {
      "formattingProvider": "fourmolu"
    }
  }
  ```

  The Brittany formatter is now also available on GHC 8.10.1.

  ## 0.2.2

  This changes the configuration section from "languageServerHaskell" to "haskell"
  to align it with vscode-haskell-1.0.0. Whilst the old section is still
  supported for now, you should update your LSP configuration (which varies per
  client) from

  ```json
  {
    "languageServerHaskell": {
      "formattingProvider": "stylish-haskell"
    }
  }
  ```

  to

  ```json
  {
    "haskell": {
      "formattingProvider": "stylish-haskell"
    }
  }
  ```

  ([#248](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/248) by @bubba)

  ## 0.2.1

  This release includes a new eval plugin that allows Haddock code examples to be
  evaluated through a code lens. For example, the code below will now offer to
  evaluate `intercalate " " example`, and will insert the output in the line
  below.

  ```haskell
  example :: [String]
  example = ["This is an example", "of", "interactive", "evaluation"]

  -- >>> intercalate " " example
  -- "This is an example of interactive evaluation"
  --
  ```

  This is also the first release to have binaries distributed alongside it. Some
  behind the scene changes include the GHC library directory now being obtained on
  the fly, so either `ghc`, `cabal` or `stack` will need to be present on your
  PATH depending on your project. See `docs/releases.md` for more information. If
  you find any issues with this, please let us know!

  ## 0.1

  ### In this version

  - cabal to 2020-05-02T10:11:15Z
  - stack-8.8.3 to lts-15.10
  - stack to nightly-2020-05-01

  ### Changes

  This is the initial version, so too many to list individually.

  The key point is that is now supports multi-component cradles, and has been in
  daily use by the developers for some time.

  It still does not have feature parity with `haskell-ide-engine`, but it is
  currently useful.

  Features\n\n- Code evaluation codelens ([Tutorial](plugins/hls-eval-plugin/README.md)):\n\n
  \  ![Eval Demo](plugins/hls-eval-plugin/demo.gif)\n\n- Type information and documentation
  on hover. Note that currently, in order for docs to be displayed for dependencies,
  they must have been built with GHC's `-haddock` flag:\n\n  - For cabal:\n      -
  Add to your global config file (e.g. `~/.cabal/config`):\n        ```\n        program-default-options\n
  \         ghc-options: -haddock\n        ```\n      - Or, for a single project,
  run `cabal configure --ghc-options=-haddock`\n\n  - For stack, add to global `$STACK_ROOT\\config.yaml`,
  or project's `stack.yaml`:\n    ```\n    ghc-options:\n      \"$everything\": -haddock\n
  \   ```\n\n  This will cause compilation errors if a dependency contains invalid
  Haddock markup, though from GHC version 9.0, [these will be demoted to warnings](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/2377).\n\n
  - Integration with [retrie](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/retrie)\n\n   ![Retrie](https://i.imgur.com/Ev7B87k.gif)\n\n
  - Code lenses for explicit import lists\n\n   ![Imports code lens](https://imgur.com/pX9kvY4.gif)\n\n
  - Many more (TBD)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- For standalone `.hs`/`.lhs`
  files, [ghc](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) must be installed and on the PATH. The
  easiest way to install it is with [ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) or [Chocolatey](https://www.haskell.org/platform/windows.html)
  on Windows.\n- For Cabal based projects, both ghc and [cabal-install](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/)
  must be installed and on the PATH. It can also be installed with [ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/)
  or [Chocolatey](https://www.haskell.org/platform/windows.html) on Windows.\n- For
  Stack based projects, [stack](http://haskellstack.org) must be installed and on
  the PATH.\n\n### ghcup\n\nIf you are using [`ghcup`](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/)
  to manage your installations, you can install the latest version of `haskell-language-server`
  with\n```\nghcup install hls\n```\n\n### Visual Studio Code\n\nIf you are using
  Visual Studio Code, the [Haskell extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=haskell.haskell)
  will automatically download and install `haskell-language-server` for you.\n\n###
  Pre-built binaries\n\nThere are pre-built binaries available from the [releases
  page](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/releases) for Linux, Windows
  and macOS.\nTo install, download the `haskell-language-server-wrapper` executable
  for your platform as well as any `haskell-language-server` executables for the GHC
  versions you plan on working with, and either put them on your PATH or point your
  client to them.\n\n### Installation from source\n\n#### Common pre-requirements\n\n-
  `stack` or `cabal` must be in your PATH\n  - You need stack version >= 2.1.1 or
  cabal >= 2.4.0.0\n- `git` must be in your PATH\n- The directory where `stack`or
  `cabal` put the binaries must be in you PATH:\n  - For stack you can get it with
  `stack path --local-bin`\n  - For cabal it is by default `$HOME/.cabal/bin` in linux
  and `%APPDATA%\\cabal\\bin` in windows.\n\nTip: you can quickly check if some command
  is in your path by running the command.\nIf you receive some meaningful output instead
  of \"command not found\"-like message\nthen it means you have the command in PATH.\n\n####
  Linux-specific pre-requirements\n\nOn Linux you will need install a couple of extra
  libraries:\n- [Unicode (ICU)](http://site.icu-project.org/)\n- [NCURSES](https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/)\n-
  [Zlib](https://zlib.net/)\n\n**Debian 9/Ubuntu 18.04 or earlier**:\n\n```bash\nsudo
  apt install libicu-dev libtinfo-dev libgmp-dev zlib1g-dev\n```\n\n**Debian 10/Ubuntu
  18.10 or later**:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install libicu-dev libncurses-dev libgmp-dev
  zlib1g-dev\n```\n\n**Fedora**:\n\n```bash\nsudo dnf install libicu-devel ncurses-devel
  zlib-devel\n```\n\n#### Windows-specific pre-requirements\n\nIn order to avoid problems
  with long paths on Windows you can do either one of the following:\n\n1. Clone the
  `haskell-language-server` to a short path, for example the root of your logical
  drive (e.g. to\n   `C:\\hls`). Even if you choose `C:\\haskell-language-server`
  you could hit the problem. If this doesn't work or you want to use a longer path,
  try the second option.\n\n2. If the `Local Group Policy Editor` is available on
  your system, go to: `Local Computer Policy -> Computer Configuration -> Administrative
  Templates -> System -> Filesystem` set `Enable Win32 long paths` to `Enabled`. If
  you don't have the policy editor you can use regedit by using the following instructions
  [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#enable-long-paths-in-windows-10-version-1607-and-later).
  You also need to configure git to allow longer paths by using unicode paths. To
  set this for all your git repositories use `git config --system core.longpaths true`
  (you probably need an administrative shell for this) or for just this one repository
  use `git config core.longpaths true`.\n\nIn addition make sure `haskell-language-server.exe`
  is not running by closing your editor, otherwise in case of an upgrade the executable
  can not be installed.\n\n#### Download the source code\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server
  --recurse-submodules\ncd haskell-language-server\n```\n\n#### Building\n\nNote,
  on first invocation of the build script with stack, a GHC is being installed for
  execution.\nThe GHC used for the `install.hs` can be adjusted in `./install/stack.yaml`
  by using a different resolver.\n\nAvailable commands can be seen with:\n\n```bash\nstack
  ./install.hs help\n```\n\nRemember, this will take time to download a Stackage-LTS
  and an appropriate GHC for build\nhaskell-language-server the first time.\n\n#####
  Install via cabal\n\nThe install-script can be invoked via `cabal` instead of `stack`
  with the command\n\n```bash\ncabal v2-run ./install.hs --project-file install/shake.project
  <target>\n```\n\nor using the existing alias script\n\n```bash\n./cabal-hls-install
  <target>\n```\n\nRunning the script with cabal on windows requires a cabal version
  greater or equal to `3.0.0.0`.\n\nFor brevity, only the `stack`-based commands are
  presented in the following sections.\n\n##### Install specific GHC Version\n\nThe
  script will install the executables `haskell-language-server-wrapper` and `haskell-language-server`.\n\nIt
  will copy the latter appending the used ghc version, needed by the wrapper to choose
  the suitable version\nfor the project at hand.\n\nSo installing the executables
  directly with `stack install` or `cabal v2-install` may not be enough\nfor it to
  work properly.\n\nInstall haskell-language-server for the latest available and supported
  GHC version (and hoogle docs):\n\n```bash\nstack ./install.hs hls\n```\n\nInstall
  haskell-language-server for a specific GHC version (and hoogle docs):\n\n```bash\nstack
  ./install.hs hls-8.8.3\n```\n\n`hls-8.8.3` target will build the project and install
  `haskell-language-server-wrapper`,\n`haskell-language-server`, `haskell-language-server-8.8.3`
  and `haskell-language-server-8.8`\nexecutables.\n\nThe Haskell Language Server can
  also be built with `cabal v2-build` instead of `stack build`.\nThis has the advantage
  that you can decide how the GHC versions have been installed.\nTo see what GHC versions
  are available, the command `cabal-hls-install ghcs` can be used.\nIt will list all
  *supported* GHC versions that are on the path for build with their respective installation
  directory.\nIf you think, this list is incomplete, you can try to modify the PATH
  variable, such that the executables can be found.\nNote, that the targets `hls`
  and `data` depend on the found GHC versions.\n\nAn example output is:\n\n```bash\n>
  ./cabal-hls-install ghcs\n******************************************************************\nFound
  the following GHC paths:\nghc-8.6.5: /opt/bin/ghc-8.6.5\nghc-8.8.3: /opt/bin/ghc-8.8.3\n\n******************************************************************\n```\n\nIf
  your desired ghc has been found, you use it to install haskell-language-server.\n\n```bash\n./cabal-hls-install
  hls-8.6.5\n```\n\n### Installation from Hackage\n\nDirect installation from Hackage,
  while possible via `cabal install haskell-language-server`, is not recommended for
  most people.\nSaid command builds the `haskell-language-server` binary and installs
  it in the default Cabal binaries folder,\nbut the binary will only work with projects
  that use the same GHC version that built it.\n\n## Configuring `haskell-language-server`\n\nLanguage
  servers like `haskell-language-server` expose most of their configuration via the
  client (i.e. the editor).\nThat means that the way in which you configure the settings
  will depend on the client.\n\nMost clients (editors) already have an opinion about
  how settings should be configured!\nFor example, in VS Code you use the graphical
  Settings tab or `settings.json`, whereas in Emacs you use customization variables.\nIn
  the [editor configuration section](#configuring-your-editor) we give some pointers
  for popular editors, but you should consult the documentation for your specific
  editor if you have trouble.\n\nHowever, we can say some high-level things about
  the kinds of configuration `haskell-language-server` uses, and how to use them.\nThis
  can sound a bit confusing, but ultimately the client should present you with these
  options in a user-friendly way that makes sense for that editor.\n\n### Generic
  server options\n\nThe LSP protocol is designed to support many useful server configuration
  options generically.\nThese are sent to the server by the client, and can be controlled
  without reference to a specific language.\n\nFor example, there are protocol methods
  for highlighting matching identifiers throughout a document.\nThis is a capability
  which any server can implement, so the client can decide generically whether to
  ask the server to do it or not.\nSo your editor can provide a setting to turn this
  on or off globally, for any language server you might use.\n\nSettings like this
  are typically provided by the generic LSP client support for your editor, for example
  in Emacs by `lsp-mode`.\n\n### Generic editor options\n\nYour editor may provide
  some settings that affect how the information from the language server is used.\nFor
  example, whether popups are shown, or whether code lenses appear by default.\n\nSettings
  like this are typically provided by the generic LSP client support for your editor,
  for example in Emacs by `lsp-mode`.\n\n### Language-specific server options\n\nA
  specific language server can also have its own configuration options.\nThese are
  still sent to the server by the client, but they can only be controlled by a specific
  client that knows about those options.\n\nFor example, `haskell-language-server`
  allows you to choose the formatting provider which will be used for formatting Haskell
  source.\nThis option obviously would not make sense for language servers for other
  languages, or even for other Haskell language servers (which need not even support
  formatting).\n\nHere is a list of the additional settings currently supported by
  `haskell-language-server`, along with their setting key (you may not need to know
  this) and default:\n- Formatting provider (`haskell.formattingProvider`, default
  `ormolu`): what formatter to use; one of `floskell`, `ormolu`, `fourmolu`, `stylish-haskell`,
  or `brittany` (if compiled with AGPL)\n- Format on imports (`haskell.formatOnImportOn`,
  default true): whether to format after adding an import\n- Maximum number of problems
  to report (`haskell.maxNumberOfProblems`, default 100): the maximum number of problems
  the server will send to the client\n- Diagnostics on change (`haskell.diagnosticsOnChange`,
  default true): (currently unused)\n- Completion snippets (`haskell.completionSnippetsOn`,
  default true): whether to support completion snippets\n- Liquid Haskell (`haskell.liquidOn`,
  default false): whether to enable Liquid Haskell support (currently unused until
  the Liquid Haskell support is functional again)\n- Hlint (`haskell.hlintOn`, default
  true): whether to enable Hlint support\n- Max completions (`haskell.maxCompletions`,
  default 40): maximum number of completions sent to the LSP client.\n\nSettings like
  this are typically provided by the language-specific LSP client support for your
  editor, for example in Emacs by `lsp-haskell`.\n\n### Client options\n\nA particular
  client might also have some options of its own, for example to control how the server
  executable is started.\n\nSettings like this are typically be provided by the language-specific
  LSP client support for your editor, for example in Emacs by `lsp-haskell`.\n\n##
  Configuring your project build\n\n`haskell-language-server` has to compile your
  project in order to give you diagnostics, which means that it needs to know how
  to do so.\nThis is handled by the [`hie-bios`](https://github.com/mpickering/hie-bios)
  project.\n\n**For a full explanation of how `hie-bios` determines the project build
  configuration, and how to configure it manually, refer to the [`hie-bios` README](https://github.com/mpickering/hie-bios/blob/master/README.md).**\n\nAt
  the moment, `haskell-language-server` has some limited support to automatically
  detect your project build configuration.\nThe plan is to improve it to handle most
  use cases.\n\nHowever, for now, the most reliable way is to manually configure `hie-bios`
  using a `hie.yaml` file in the root of the workspace.\nA `hie.yaml` file **explicitly**
  describes how to setup the environment to compile the various parts of your project.\nFor
  that you need to know what *components* your project has, and the path associated
  with each one.\nSo you will need some knowledge about\n[stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/build_command/#components)
  or [cabal](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cabal-commands.html?#cabal-v2-build)
  components.\n\nYou also can use [this utility](https://github.com/Avi-D-coder/implicit-hie)
  to automatically generate `hie.yaml` files for\nthe most common stack and cabal
  configurations\n\nFor example, to state that you want to use `stack` then the configuration
  file\nwould look like:\n\n```yaml\ncradle:\n  stack:\n    component: \"haskell-language-server:lib\"\n```\n\nIf
  you use `cabal` then you probably need to specify which component you want\nto use.\n\n```yaml\ncradle:\n
  \ cabal:\n    component: \"lib:haskell-language-server\"\n```\n\nIf you have a project
  with multiple components, you can use a cabal-multi\ncradle:\n\n```yaml\ncradle:\n
  \ cabal:\n    - path: \"./test/functional/\"\n      component: \"haskell-language-server:func-test\"\n
  \   - path: \"./test/utils/\"\n      component: \"haskell-language-server:hls-test-utils\"\n
  \   - path: \"./exe/Main.hs\"\n      component: \"haskell-language-server:exe:haskell-language-server\"\n
  \   - path: \"./exe/Wrapper.hs\"\n      component: \"haskell-language-server:exe:haskell-language-server-wrapper\"\n
  \   - path: \"./src\"\n      component: \"lib:haskell-language-server\"\n    - path:
  \"./ghcide/src\"\n      component: \"ghcide:lib:ghcide\"\n    - path: \"./ghcide/exe\"\n
  \     component: \"ghcide:exe:ghcide\"\n```\n\nEquivalently, you can use stack:\n\n```yaml\ncradle:\n
  \ stack:\n    - path: \"./test/functional/\"\n      component: \"haskell-language-server:func-test\"\n
  \   - path: \"./exe/Main.hs\"\n      component: \"haskell-language-server:exe:haskell-language-server\"\n
  \   - path: \"./exe/Wrapper.hs\"\n      component: \"haskell-language-server:exe:haskell-language-server-wrapper\"\n
  \   - path: \"./src\"\n      component: \"haskell-language-server:lib\"\n    - path:
  \"./ghcide/src\"\n      component: \"ghcide:lib:ghcide\"\n    - path: \"./ghcide/exe\"\n
  \     component: \"ghcide:exe:ghcide\"\n```\n\nOr you can explicitly state the program
  which should be used to collect\nthe options by supplying the path to the program.
  It is interpreted\nrelative to the current working directory if it is not an absolute
  path.\n\n```yaml\ncradle:\n  bios:\n    program: \".hie-bios\"\n```\n\nThe complete
  configuration is a subset of\n\n```yaml\ncradle:\n  cabal:\n    component: \"optional
  component name\"\n  stack:\n    component: \"optional component name\"\n  bios:\n
  \   program: \"program to run\"\n    dependency-program: \"optional program to run\"\n
  \ direct:\n    arguments: [\"list\",\"of\",\"ghc\",\"arguments\"]\n  default:\n
  \ none:\n\ndependencies:\n  - someDep\n```\n\n## Configuring your editor\n\nMost
  editors provide a Haskell-specific extension that provides support for launching
  `haskell-language-server` and talking to it, as well as [exposing configuration
  options](#configuring-haskell-language-server).\n\nEditors typically assume that
  you have already installed `haskell-language-server` (see above) and that the installation
  script put the `haskell-language-server` and `haskell-language-server-wrapper` binaries
  in your `PATH` (usually `~/.local/bin` or `~/.cabal/bin` on Linux and macOS, `%APPDATA%\\local\\bin`
  or `%APPDATA%\\cabal\\bin` on Windows).\nThe exception is VS Code, which can automatically
  install the binaries if they are not installed already.\n\n### Using Haskell Language
  Server with VS Code\n\nInstall from\n[the VSCode marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=haskell.haskell),
  or manually from the repository [vscode-haskell](https://github.com/haskell/vscode-haskell).\nThe
  `haskell-language-server` and `haskell-language-server-wrapper` binaries will be
  automatically downloaded on an ad-hoc basis, but if you have them already installed
  on your PATH then it will just use them instead.\n\nConfiguration is done via the
  \"Haskell\" section of \"Settings\".\n\n### Using Haskell Language Server with Sublime
  Text\n\n- Install [LSP](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP) using [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/)\n-
  From Sublime Text, go to Preferences and search for LSP Settings\n- Paste in these
  settings. Make sure to change the command path to your `haskell-language-server-wrapper`\n\n```json\n{\n
  \ \"clients\": {\n    \"haskell-language-server\": {\n      \"command\": [\"haskell-language-server-wrapper\",
  \"--lsp\"],\n      \"scopes\": [\"source.haskell\"],\n      \"syntaxes\": [\"Packages/Haskell/Haskell.sublime-syntax\"],\n
  \     \"languageId\": \"haskell\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow open a Haskell project
  with Sublime Text and enable Language Server in the project.\nYou should have these
  features available:\n\n1. Errors are underlined in red\n2. LSP: Show Diagnostics
  will show a list of hints and errors\n3. LSP: Format Document will prettify the
  file\n\n### Using Haskell Language Server with Vim or Neovim\n\nYou can use [Coc](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim),
  [LanguageClient-neovim](https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim)\nor any
  other Vim Language server protocol client.\nCoc is recommend since it is the only
  complete LSP implementation for Vim and Neovim and offers snippets and floating
  documentation out of the box.\n\n#### Coc\n\nFollow Coc's [installation instructions](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim).\nThen
  issue `:CocConfig` and add the following to your Coc config file.\n\n```json\n{\n
  \ \"languageserver\": {\n    \"haskell\": {\n      \"command\": \"haskell-language-server-wrapper\",\n
  \     \"args\": [\"--lsp\"],\n      \"rootPatterns\": [\"*.cabal\", \"stack.yaml\",
  \"cabal.project\", \"package.yaml\", \"hie.yaml\"],\n      \"filetypes\": [\"haskell\",
  \"lhaskell\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### LanguageClient-neovim\n\n##### vim-plug\n\nIf
  you use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), then you can do this by
  e.g.,\nincluding the following line in the Plug section of your `init.vim` or `~/.vimrc`:\n\n```text\nPlug
  'autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim', {\n    \\ 'branch': 'next',\n    \\ 'do': 'bash
  install.sh'\n    \\ }\n```\n\nand issuing a `:PlugInstall` command within Neovim
  or Vim.\n\n##### Clone the LanguageClient-neovim repo\n\nAs an alternative to using
  [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) shown above, clone [LanguageClient-neovim](https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim)\ninto
  `~/.vim/pack/XXX/start/`, where `XXX` is just a name for your \"plugin suite\".\n\n#####
  Configuration and sample `~/.vimrc` sections\n\n```vim\nset rtp+=~/.vim/pack/XXX/start/LanguageClient-neovim\nlet
  g:LanguageClient_serverCommands = { 'haskell': ['haskell-language-server-wrapper',
  '--lsp'] }\n```\n\nYou'll probably want to add some mappings for common commands:\n\n```vim\nnnoremap
  <F5> :call LanguageClient_contextMenu()<CR>\nmap <Leader>lk :call LanguageClient#textDocument_hover()<CR>\nmap
  <Leader>lg :call LanguageClient#textDocument_definition()<CR>\nmap <Leader>lr :call
  LanguageClient#textDocument_rename()<CR>\nmap <Leader>lf :call LanguageClient#textDocument_formatting()<CR>\nmap
  <Leader>lb :call LanguageClient#textDocument_references()<CR>\nmap <Leader>la :call
  LanguageClient#textDocument_codeAction()<CR>\nmap <Leader>ls :call LanguageClient#textDocument_documentSymbol()<CR>\n```\n\nUse
  <kbd>Ctrl+x</kbd><kbd>Ctrl+o</kbd> (`<C-x><C-o>`) to open up the auto-complete menu,\nor
  for asynchronous auto-completion, follow the setup instructions on\n[LanguageClient](https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim).\n\nIf
  you'd like diagnostics to be highlighted, add a highlight group for `ALEError`/`ALEWarning`/`ALEInfo`,\nor
  customize `g:LanguageClient_diagnosticsDisplay`:\n\n```vim\nhi link ALEError Error\nhi
  Warning term=underline cterm=underline ctermfg=Yellow gui=undercurl guisp=Gold\nhi
  link ALEWarning Warning\nhi link ALEInfo SpellCap\n```\n\nIf you're finding that
  the server isn't starting at the correct project root,\nit may also be helpful to
  also specify root markers:\n\n```vim\nlet g:LanguageClient_rootMarkers = ['*.cabal',
  'stack.yaml']\n```\n\nFurther configuration can be done by pointing the [`g:LanguageClient_settingsPath`](https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim/blob/0e5c9546bfddbaa2b01e5056389c25aefc8bf989/doc/LanguageClient.txt#L221)\nvariable
  to the file in which you want to keep your LSP settings.\n\n### Using Haskell Language
  Server with Atom\n\nInstall the two Atom packages [atom-ide-ui](https://atom.io/packages/atom-ide-ui)
  and [haskell](https://atom.io/packages/haskell),\n\n```bash\n$ apm install language-haskell
  atom-ide-ui haskell\n```\n\n### Using haskell-language-server with Emacs\n\nEmacs
  support is provided by a combination of the following packages:\n\n[lsp-mode](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode)\n[lsp-ui](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-ui)\n[lsp-haskell](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-haskell)\n\nYou
  can install these manually if you are using plain Emacs; instructions for some specific
  flavours\nare included below.\n\nMake sure to check the READMEs of each of these
  packages, which explain how to configure the\nvarious parts of the Emacs integration.\nIn
  particular, `lsp-haskell` provides customization options for the `haskell-language-server`-specific
  parts,\nsuch as the path to the server executable.\n\n#### Using haskell-language-server
  with [doom-emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/tree/develop/modules/lang/haskell#module-flags)\n\nManual
  installation of packages is not required.\nEnable the lsp module and the haskell
  lang module with lsp flag in `.doom.d/init.el`:\n\n``` emacs-lisp\n:tools\nlsp\n;;
  ...\n:lang\n(haskell +lsp)\n```\n\nthen do `$HOME/.emacs.d/bin/doom sync`\n\n####
  Using haskell-language-server with [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs)\n\nManual
  installation of packages is not required.\nEnable the `haskell` layer and the `lsp`
  layer in your Spacemacs config file:\n\n```emacs-lisp\ndotspacemacs-configuration-layers\n
  \ '(\n    haskell\n    lsp\n    ;; ...\n  )\n```\n\n### Using haskell-language-server
  with [Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune)\n\n1. Grab a copy of [kak-lsp](https://github.com/ul/kak-lsp),
  and follow the setup instructions.\n2. Point your `kak-lsp.toml` to `haskell-language-server-wrapper`.\n\n```toml\n[language.haskell]\nfiletypes
  = [\"haskell\"]\nroots = [\"Setup.hs\", \"stack.yaml\", \"*.cabal\"]\ncommand =
  \"haskell-language-server-wrapper\"\nargs = [\"--lsp\"]\n```\n\n## Known limitations\n\n###
  Preprocessor\nHLS is not yet able to find project preprocessors, which may result
  in `could not execute: <preprocessor>` errors. This problem is\ntracked in https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/176
  and originally comes from https://github.com/mpickering/hie-bios/issues/125\n\nAs
  a workaround, you need to ensure the preprocessor is available in the path (install
  globally with Stack or Cabal, provide in `shell.nix`, etc.).\n\nExample with `tasty-discover`:\n```haskell\n{-#
  OPTIONS_GHC -F -pgmF tasty-discover #-}\n```\nThis returns an error in HLS if 'tasty-discover'
  is not in the path: `could not execute: tasty-discover`.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n###
  Common issues\n\n#### Difficulties with Stack and `Paths_` modules\n\nThese are
  known to be somewhat buggy at the moment: https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/478.\nThis
  issue should be fixed in Stack versions >= 2.5.\n\n#### Problems with dynamic linking\n\nAs
  haskell-language-server prebuilt binaries are statically linked, they don't play
  well with projects using dynamic linking.\nAn usual symptom is the presence of errors
  containing `unknown symbol` and it is typical in arch linux, where a dynamically
  linked version of ghc is used. \n\nThe workaround is to use a version of haskell-language-server
  compiled from source with `-dynamic` enabled`. See more details [here](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/1160#issuecomment-756566273).\n\n###
  Troubleshooting the server\n\n#### Diagnostic mode\n\nThe `haskell-language-server`
  executable can be run in diagnostic mode, where it will just try to load modules
  from your project, printing all of its output to stdout.\nThis makes it much easier
  to see what's going on and to diagnose build-related problems.\n\nTo do this, simply
  run the executable directly from your shell in the project root.\nYou can either
  run it without an argument, in which case it will load random modules, or with a
  path, in which case it will load modules in that file or directory.\n\n#### Examining
  the log\n\nMost clients will launch `haskell-language-server` with `--logfile` to
  make it write a log file.\nPlease consult the documentation for your client to find
  out where this is (or how to set it).\n\nThe log will contain all the messages that
  are sent to the server and its responses.\nThis is helpful for low-level debugging:
  if you expect a certain action to happen, you can look in the log to see if the
  corresponding messages are\nsent, or if there are any errors.\n\nTo get a more verbose,
  also pass `--debug` to the executable.\n\n### Troubleshooting the client\n\nMany
  clients provide diagnostic information about a LSP session.\nIn particular, look
  for a way to get the status of the server, the server stderr, or a log of the messages
  that the client has sent to the server.\nFor example, `lsp-mode` provides all of
  these (see its [troubleshooting page](https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/troubleshooting/)
  for details).\n\nThe most common client-related problem is the client simply not
  finding the server executable, so make sure that you have the right `PATH` and you
  have configured\nit to look for the right executable.\n\n## Contributing\n\n:heart:
  The Haskell tooling dream is near, we need your help! :heart:\n\n- Join [our IRC
  channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=haskell-ide-engine) at `#haskell-ide-engine`
  on `freenode`.\n- Fork this repo and [ghcide](https://github.com/haskell/ghcide)
  and hack as much as you can.\n\n### Style guidelines\n\nThe project includes a [`.editorconfig`](https://editorconfig.org)
  [file](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/blob/master/.editorconfig)
  with the editor basic settings used by the project.\nHowever, most editors will
  need some action to honour those settings automatically.\nFor example vscode needs
  to have installed a specific [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig).\nPlease,
  try to follow those basic settings to keep the codebase as uniform as possible.\n\n###
  Building haskell-language-server\n\nThe project can be built with both `cabal build`
  and `stack build`.\n\nhaskell-language-server can also be used with itself. We provide
  preset samples of `hie.yaml` for Cabal and Stack.\n\nNote: the `./install/` folder
  is not directly tied to the project so it has dedicated `./install/hie.yaml.[cbl|stack]`\ntemplates.\n\n####
  Using Cabal\n\n```shell\n$ cp hie-cabal.yaml hie.yaml\n$ cp install/hie-cabal.yaml
  install/hie.yaml\n```\n\n#### Using Stack\n\n```shell\n$ cp hie-stack.yaml hie.yaml\n$
  cp install/hie-stack.yaml install/hie.yaml\n$ cp ghcide/hie-stack.yaml ghcide/hie.yaml\n$
  stack build --test --no-run-tests\n$ cd install\n$ stack build\n```\n\n#### Using
  Nix\n\nThe instructions below show how to set up a Cachix binary cache and open
  a nix shell for local development.\n\n```shell\n$ cachix use haskell-language-server\n$
  nix-shell\n$ cabal update\n$ cabal build\n```\n\nIf you are looking for a Nix expression
  to create haskell-language-server binaries, see https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/122\n\n####
  Introduction tutorial\nPepeiborra [wrote an tutorial](https://github.com/pepeiborra/hls-tutorial)
  on writing a plugin in HLS.\n\n#### Test your hacked HLS in your editor\nIf you
  want to test HLS while hacking on it, follow the steps below.\n\nTo do once:\n-
  Open some codebase on which you want to test your hacked HLS in your favorite editor\n-
  Configure this editor to use your custom HLS executable\n  - With Cabal:\n    -
  On Unix systems: `cabal exec which haskell-language-server`\n    - On Windows: `cabal
  exec where haskell-language-server`\n  - With Stack: `$(stack path --dist-dir)/build/haskell-language-server/haskell-language-server`\n\nTo
  do every time you changed code and want to test it:\n- Build HLS\n  - With Cabal:
  `cabal build exe:haskell-language-server`\n  - With Stack: `stack build haskell-language-server:exe:haskell-language-server`\n-
  Restart HLS\n  - With VS Code: `Haskell: Restart Haskell LSP Server`\n\n### Adding
  support for a new editor\n\nAdding support for new editors is fairly easy if the
  editor already has good support for generic LSP-based extensions.\nIn that case,
  there will likely be an editor-specific support system for this (like `lsp-mode`
  for Emacs).\nThis will typically provide instructions for how to support new languages.\n\nIn
  some cases you may need to write a small bit of additional client support, or expose
  a way for the user to set the server's [configuration options](#configuring-haskell-language-server)
  and\nfor them to configure how the server is started.\n"
