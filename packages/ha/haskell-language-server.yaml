changelog: "# Changelog for haskell-language-server\n\n## 2.6.0.0\n\n- Bindists for
  GHC 9.6.4\n- A new semantic tokens plugin (#3892, @soulomoon).\n- Improvements to
  multiple home unit support with GHC 9.4. Using cabal 3.11+ will\n  load proper multiple
  home unit sessions by default, fixing a lot of issues with\n  loading and reloading
  projects that have more than one component (#3462, @wz1000).\n- Removed implicit-hie,
  resulting in better behaviour for projects without cradles.\n- Don't produce diagnostics
  for disabled plugins (#3941, @fendor).\n- Many other bug fixes.\n\n### Pull Requests\n\n-

  by @MorrowM\n\n\n## 1.6.0.0\n\nTime for a new and exciting hls release:\n\n- It
  includes *three* brand new plugins:\n  - [Alternate number literals](https://haskell-language-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features.html#convert-numbers-to-alternative-formats)
  thanks to @drsooch\n  - [Qualify imported names](https://haskell-language-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features.html#qualify-imported-names)
  thanks to @eddiemundo\n  - New plugin to support [selection range](https://haskell-language-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features.html#selection-range)
  (aka double click text selection) thanks to @kokobd\n- Finally hls [supports *ghc
  9.2.1*](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/2179)\n  - Including
  core features and [many plugins](https://haskell-language-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/supported-versions.html#plugins-support-by-ghc-version)\n
  \ - Thanks to a great collective effort coordinated by @pepeiborra and with the
  help of @wz1000, @mpickering and @alanz among others\n- Hls now also [supports *ghc
  9.0.2*](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/297) with all
  plugins but the stylish-haskell formatter\n  - Including the [wingman plugin](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/tree/master/plugins/hls-tactics-plugin)
  thanks to @isovector and @anka-213\n- And many many fixes and performance improvements,
  thanks to all contributors!\n\n### Deprecation notice for 1.6.0\n\n- As we noted
  in the previous release we have dropped support for ghc versions 8.10.5 and 8.8.3
  in *this release*\n  - We recommend upgrading ghc to the last minor version: 8.8.4
  or 8.10.7\n  - You can read more about ghc deprecation policy and schedule [here](https://haskell-language-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/supported-versions.html)\n-
  *After this release*:\n  - [We will remove all project stack.yaml's](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/2533)
  but two: one for last lts and other for nightly. Temporary we could keep one more
  stack yaml when nightly upgrades the ghc version, to help in the transition\n  -
  [We will remove the install script](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/2491)
  which lives [here](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/tree/master/install)\n
  \   - If you want to install hls from source we recommend using `ghcup`. Download
  it and run `ghcup compile hls --help` to get more info about.\n\n### Pull requests

  after releasing 1.5.0:\n\n- [#2365](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issue/2365):
  hs-boot files not handled correctly, discovered in the ghc codebase and fixed with
  [#2377](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/2377)\n- [#2379](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issue/2379):
  `tried to look at linkable for GetModIfaceWithoutLinkable for NormalizedFilePath...`
  error handling template haskell, fixed with [#2380](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/2380)\n\nBoth
  quick fixes thanks to @pepeiborra\n\nAlso it fixes some long standing bugs in the
  hlint plugin due to comments being ignored (see [#2366](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/2366))\n\n###

  by @jneira\n\n## 1.5.0\n\nTime for another hls release:\n\n- @pepeiborra has done
  an epic work to improve performance, redefining some of the core pieces of HLS\n
  \ - You can take an overall look to improvements in [these slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16FpmiHXX_rd2gAf5XVgWAIr4kg-AkUqX/view)\n-
  We have fourmolu support for ghc-9.0.1 thanks to @georgefst\n- We have got improvements
  over import suggestions thanks to @yoshitsugu and @alexnaspo\n- Completions also
  has been improved in general thanks to @pepeiborra\n- There have been lot of documentation
  updates by several contributors, thanks also to all of you\n- In this release we
  still don't have full support for all plugins and ghc-9.0.1\n  - Missing plugins
  for ghc-9.0.1 are: hls-class-plugin, hls-tactics-plugin (wingman), hls-brittany-plugin
  and hls-stylish-haskell-plugin\n\n### Deprecation notice for 1.5.0\n\n- As we noted
  in the previous release we have dropped support for ghc versions 8.6.4, 8.10.2,
  8.10.3, 8.10.4 in *this release*\n- We will drop support for ghc versions 8.10.5
  and 8.8.3 *after this release*\n- The advise is upgrade ghc to the last minor version:
  8.6.5, 8.8.4 or 8.10.7\n- You can read more about ghc deprecation policy and schedule
  [here](https://haskell-language-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/supported-versions.html)\n\n###

  Support for ghc 8.10.6 and 8.10.7\n- The ormolu formatter plugin works with ghc
  9.0.1\n- *Call hierarchy plugin has been improved* thanks to @July541:\n  - Add
  call from type signature\n  - Add call from a function pattern\n  - Go to typeclass
  instance directly\n- As usual @isovector has been busy improving wingman plugin:\n
  \ - New \"intro and destruct\" code action\n  - Streaming tactic solutions: when
  Wingman times outs, it can still pick the best solution it found\n  - Let-bindings
  in metattactics: allows you to bind variables in tactic metaprogram\n  - Several
  bug fixes\n- We have new docs thanks to @michaelpj: <https://haskell-language-server.readthedocs.io>\n-
  Now you can ask the executable for included plugins with: `haskell-language-server
  --list-plugins`\n- There are several bug fixes and features you can found in the
  merged pull requests list\n\n### DEPRECATION NOTICE\n\n- *After* this release we
  will drop support for ghc versions 8.6.4, 8.10.3 and 8.10.4\n  - The advise is upgrade
  ghc to the last minor version: 8.6.5 or 8.10.7\n  - Take a look to [this issue](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/2168)

  binaries for GHC 9.0.1\nand some new interesting features. Here is the brief summary
  of changes:\n\n- Binaries for GHC 9.0.1 are added by @anka-213.\n- Call hierarchy
  plugin is added, contributed by @July541.\n  ![hierarchy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12473268/127550041-094151a6-be7b-484a-bb82-c61f326ca503.gif)\n-
  Now completions work with definitions from non-imported modules, thanks to @pepeiborra.\n
  \ ![completion](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12473268/127543694-718ae043-38f2-4fb0-be71-317f5f93b443.gif)\n-
  Eval plugin\n  - The plugin supports GHC 9.0.1, thanks to @berberman.\n  - `:info`
  command is added by @akrmn.\n  - The plugin uses the same default language as GHCi
  with @fmehta's patch.\n- Wingman, where most changes owing to @isovector\n  - Wingman
  no longer changes the fixity of function definitions.\n  - Wingman now gives unique
  names to the holes it generates.\n  - Wingman's ability to reason about polymorphic
  and GADT types is significantly improved.\n  - Wingman no longer suggests homomorphic
  destructs when the codomain is larger than the domain.\n  - \"Complete case constructors\"
  action supports empty lambda cases.\n  - Wingman now gives a warning if it ran out
  of gas during \"attempt to fill hole\".\n  - Metaprogramming for Wingman has been
  improved with symbolic-name support and the `pointwise` combinator.\n  - An option
  to enable/disable Wingman's proof state styling is added.\n  - Hole fit suggestions
  are now disabled for performance reasons when using Wingman.\n- Hovering on a name
  displays the package where the name is defined, contributed by @berberman.\n  ![hover](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12473268/127550516-acc1f1b4-bad7-44fd-99a0-a174ce9ac909.gif)\n\n###

  @fmehta\n\n## 1.2.0\n\nWe have finally released a new version of Haskell Language
  Server!\nThanks for all contributors, many bugs has been fixed, and many features
  has landed.\nHere are the summary of changes:\n\n- Basic support for GHC 9.0.1 is
  added.\n  It does not support all plugins yet, but core GHCIDE features will work.
  For the detailed information that which plugins work, please refer [this list](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/297#issuecomment-855522891).\n-
  Support for GHC 8.10.5 is added.\n  Note that macOS version is unfortunately not
  included in this release because of [a GHC issue with `network` package](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/19968).\n-
  HLS wrapper and GHCIDE session loader uses the same logic with implicit-hie.\n  This
  fixes [a build issue](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/1782)
  of a stack project with implicit `hie.yaml` .\n- Wingman plugin has added numerous
  features and fixed many bugs:\n  - It now supports tactic metaprogramming!\n    For
  list of commands, see [this document](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/blob/master/plugins/hls-tactics-plugin/COMMANDS.md#wingman-metaprogram-command-reference).\n
  \   ![https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/blob/master/plugins/hls-tactics-plugin/COMMANDS.md#wingman-metaprogram-command-reference](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/307223/118190278-bdf24f80-b3f7-11eb-8838-b08a2582d7f1.gif)\n
  \ - \"Refine hole\" and \"Split all function arguments\" code actions are publicly
  opened.\n  - \"Empty case split\" code lens is added.\n  - The name generator is
  fixed [to avoid dangerous summon rituals](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/1760).\n
  \ - Many bugs related to type families and GADTs are fixed.\n- We support [nix flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes),
  an upcoming way to manage dependencies in nix.\n- Every plugin (other than example
  plugins) now lives in its own package.\n\n### Pull requests merged for 1.2.0\n\n-

  by @aufarg\n\n## 1.1.0\n\nHaskell Language Server 1.1.0 has finally come! Many thanks
  to all contributors -- since the last release, we have merged over 100 PRs!\nAs
  always, there are many internal bug fixes and performance improvements in ghcide.
  Apart from that,\n\n- Wingman gets many enhancements, thanks to @isovector for this
  epic work!\n  - Wingman actions can now be bound to editor hotkeys\n  - Experimental
  support for \"jump to next unsolved hole\"\n  - Improved layout algorithm --- don't
  reflow instances, or break do-blocks\n  - Wingman can now deal with GADTs, rank-n
  types and pattern synonyms\n  - Wingman now respects user-written bindings on the
  left side of the equals sign\n  - Significantly more-natural synthesized code when
  dealing with newtypes, infix operators, records and strings\n  - Improved user experience
  --- less waiting, and friendly errors for when things go wrong\n- hlint plugin not
  working in some cases gets fixed\n- annoying log message \"haskell-lsp:incoming
  message parse error\" gets fixed in `lsp-1.2`\n- eval plugin now supports `it` variable,
  like GHCi\n- verbose message \"No cradle found for ... Proceeding with implicit
  cradle\" is GONE\n- type lenses plugin now has its custom config `mode` (enum) [`always`]
  to control its working mode:\n  - `always`: always displays type signature lenses
  of global bindings\n  - `exported`: similar to `always`, but only displays for exported
  global bindings\n  - `diagnostics`: follows diagnostic messages produced by GHC\n-
  top-level LSP option `completionSnippetsOn` and `maxNumberOfProblems` are deprecated\n-
  completions plugin now has its custom config:\n  - `autoExtendOn` (boolean) [`true`]:
  whether to enable auto extending import lists\n  - `snippetsOn` (boolean) [`true`]:
  wheter to enable completion snippets, taking the place of `completionSnippetsOn`\n-
  Wingman has its custom config:\n  - `timeout_duration` (integer) [`2`]: the timeout
  for Wingman actions, in seconds\n  - `features` (string) [`\"\"`]: feature set used
  by Wingman (See [the README of Wingman](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/tree/master/plugins/hls-tactics-plugin#readme))\n
  \ - `max_use_ctor_actions` (integer) [`5`]: maximum number of `Use constructor <x>`
  code actions that can appear\n  - `hole_severity` (enum) [`none`]: the severity
  to use when showing hole diagnostics\n- LSP symbols of typeclass and type families
  are more appropriate\n- test suite of plugins are reorganized, which no longer need
  to be run with `test-server` executable\n- two new packages `hls-test-utils` and
  `hls-stylish-haskell-plugin` are extracted\n\nThis version uses `lsp-1.2.0`, `hls-plugin-api-1.1.0`,
  and `ghcide-1.2.0.2`.\n\n### Pull requests merged for 1.1.0\n\n- Restore compat.

  by @pepeiborra\n\n## 1.0.0\n\nThis is the celebratory release of Haskell Language
  Server 1.0.0!\nThis release includes a lot of internal changes, bug fixes, leaks
  plugged, and performance improvements, thanks to all our contributors.\nAmong others,\n\n-
  We added the support for GHC 8.10.4, and removed the support for GHC 8.10.1\n    Afterward,
  we will support upmost 3 patch versions for each minor version of GHC, if no special
  situation happens.\n- As by hie-bios >= 0.7.3, we use (`${XDG_CACHE_HOME}`)[https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html]`/hie-bios/...`
  (or similar depends on OS) as a build directory for Cabal.\n- Now Eval plugin uses
  the parsing mechanism of GHC and becomes more stable.\n- We supports a code action
  to disambiguate the same identifiers from multiple imports.\n    ![gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21860/106387152-bfd16d80-641b-11eb-9394-c553fad5794b.gif)\n-
  We supports a code action to hide shadowed identifiers from import.\n    ![gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26041945/107199055-e05b8200-6a30-11eb-9198-448ab8604cc0.gif)\n-
  HIE DB is now integrated. This means we now support `find-references`, `workspace-symbol`.
  `find-definition` is also improved in a project with multiple components.\n- Brittany
  and Stylish-haskell plugins now load language extensions from the ghc session.\n-
  Tactic plugin supports eta-reduction and Agda-like split tactic and can create a
  function with piecewise definitions.\n    ![gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/307223/107991243-0af68f00-6f8b-11eb-9ff9-3e9a7363ba5f.gif)\n\n###

  has been bumped to 0.6.0.0 and `ghcide` has been bumped from 0.6.0.1 to 0.7.0.0.\n-
  It has a new brand plugin: hls-class-plugin, which helps to write class instances\n\n![gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12473268/103059293-af071f80-4572-11eb-963a-7e76b45f28b9.gif)\n\n-
  The eval plugin has been revamped, adding these new features:\n  - Tests in both
  plain comments and Haddock comments\n  - For Haddock comments: shows differences
  between latest and previous result\n  - Setup section, executed before every test\n
  \ - Execution of a section/group of tests at the time\n  - Property testing\n  -
  Setup of GHC extensions\n- A new tactic to generate automatically `Arbitrary` instances
  has been added to tactic plugin\n- There had been lot of internal changes:\n  -
  ghcide lives now directly in this repository\n  - the test suite has been cleaned
  and improved (continuing the work done in 0.7.0)\n\nThanks to all contributors and
  happy new year!\n\n### Pull requests merged for 0.8.0\n\n- Ci fixes\n([#783](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/783))

  convert your import statements into qualified imports, or into an explicit import
  list:\n\n![Imports code lens](https://imgur.com/pX9kvY4.gif)\n\nThe eval plugin
  has also learnt two new commands, `:type` and `:kind`:\n\n```haskell\n{-# LANGUAGE
  TypeApplications #-}\nfoo :: Show a => a -> String\nfoo = show\n\n-- >>> :type foo
  @Int\n-- foo @Int :: Int -> String\n\n-- >>> :type +v foo @Int\n-- foo @Int :: Show
  Int => Int -> String\n```\n\n```haskell\n-- >>> type N = 1\n-- >>> type M = 40\n--
  >>> :kind N + M + 1\n-- N + M + 1 :: Nat\n\n-- >>> type N = 1\n-- >>> type M = 40\n--
  >>> :kind N + M + 1\n-- N + M + 1 :: Nat\n```\n\nThere is now also support for GHC
  8.10.2, and a new `haskell-language-server --probe-tools` command to help debug
  what version of each tool HLS is using.\n\n```shell\n$ haskell-language-server --probe-tools\nhaskell-language-server

  provides binaries for\nGHC 8.8.4, and comes with a host of bug fixes.\n\nThe retrie
  plugin supports RULES, functions and type synonyms which can be\naccessed through
  contextual code actions.\n\nFourmolu can be used to format your code by setting
  the\n`haskell.formattingProvider` field in your LSP configuration to\n\n```json\n{\n
  \ \"haskell\": {\n    \"formattingProvider\": \"fourmolu\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe Brittany
  formatter is now also available on GHC 8.10.1.\n\n### Pull requests merged\n\n-

  \"stylish-haskell\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nto\n\n```json\n{\n  \"haskell\": {\n    \"formattingProvider\":

  by @bubba\n\n## 0.2.1\n\nThis release includes a new eval plugin that allows Haddock
  code examples to be\nevaluated through a code lens. For example, the code below
  will now offer to\nevaluate `intercalate \" \" example`, and will insert the output
  in the line\nbelow.\n\n```haskell\nexample :: [String]\nexample = [\"This is an
  example\", \"of\", \"interactive\", \"evaluation\"]\n\n-- >>> intercalate \" \"
  example\n-- \"This is an example of interactive evaluation\"\n--\n```\n\nThis is
  also the first release to have binaries distributed alongside it. Some\nbehind the
  scene changes include the GHC library directory now being obtained on\nthe fly,
  so either `ghc`, `cabal` or `stack` will need to be present on your\nPATH depending
  on your project. See `docs/releases.md` for more information. If\nyou find any issues
  with this, please let us know!\n\n### Pull requests merged for 0.2.1\n\n- Bump ormolu

  stack-8.8.3 to lts-15.10\n- stack to nightly-2020-05-01\n\n### Changes\n\nThis is
  the initial version, so too many to list individually.\n\nThe key point is that
  is now supports multi-component cradles, and has been in\ndaily use by the developers
  for some time.\n\nIt still does not have feature parity with `haskell-ide-engine`,
  but it is\ncurrently useful.\n"
