  [![Hackage version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/hapistrano.svg)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hapistrano)\n\n#
  Hapistrano\n\nHapistrano is a deployment library for Haskell applications similar
  to\nRuby's [Capistrano](http://capistranorb.com/).\n\n## Purpose\n\nWe created Hapistrano
  because:\n\n* Deploys should be simple, but as close to atomic as possible (eg,\n
  \ they shouldn't require much application downtime).\n* Rollback should be trivial
  to achieve to bring the application back\n  to the last-deployed state.\n* Deploys
  shouldn't fail because of dependency problems.\n\n## How it Works\n\nHapistrano
  (like Capistrano for Ruby) deploys applications to a new\ndirectory marked with
  a timestamp on the remote host. It creates this\nnew directory quickly by placing
  a git repository for caching purposes\non the remote server.\n\nWhen the build process
  completes, it switches a symlink to the `current`\nrelease directory, and optionally
  restarts the web server.\n\nBy default, Hapistrano keeps the last five releases
  on the target host\nfilesystem and deletes previous releases to avoid filling up
  the disk.\n\n## Usage\n\nHapistrano 0.3.0.0 looks for a configuration file called
  `hap.yaml` that\ntypically looks like this:\n\n```yaml\ndeploy_path: '/var/projects/my-project'\nhost:
  myserver.com\nport: 2222\nrepo: 'https://github.com/stackbuilders/hapistrano.git'\nrevision:
  origin/master\nbuild_script:\n  - stack setup\n  - stack build\nrestart_command:
  systemd restart my-app-service\n```\n\nThe following parameters are required:\n\n*
  `deploy_path` — the root of the deploy target on the remote host.\n* `repo` — the
  origin repository.\n* `revision` — the SHA1 or branch to deploy. If a branch, you
  will need to\n  specify it as `origin/branch_name` due to the way that the cache
  repo is\n  configured.\n\nThe following parameters are *optional*:\n\n* `host` —
  the target host, if missing, `localhost` will be assumed (which\n  is useful for
  testing and playing with `hap` locally).\n* `port` — SSH port number to use. If
  missing, 22 will be used.\n* `build_script` — instructions how to build the application
  in the form of\n  shell commands.\n* `restart_command` — if you need to restart
  a remote web server after a\n  successful rollback, specify the command that you
  use in this variable. It\n  will be run after both deploy and rollback.\n* `vc_action`
  - Controls if version control related activity should\n  take place. It defaults
  to true. When you don't want activity like\n  cloning, fetching etc. to take place,
  set this to `false`.\n* `linux` - Specify, whether or not, the target system where
  Hapistrano will\n  deploy to is a GNU/Linux or other UNIX (g.e. BSD, Mac). This
  is set to `true`\n  by default so unless the target system is not GNU/Linux, this
  should not be\n  necessary. The platform where Hapistrano is running won't affect
  the\n  available options for commands (g.e. A Mac deploying to a Ubuntu machine,\n
  \ doesn't need this flag)\n* `run_locally:`- Instructions to run locally on your
  machine in the\n  form of shell commands. Example:\n\n```\nrun_locally:\n  - pwd\n
  \ - bash deploy.sh\n```\n\nNote how we are even able to execute a bash script named
  `deploy.sh`\nabove. Be sure to use `set -e` in your bash script to avoid\nheadaches.
  Hapistrano will stop the execution on non zero exit\ncodes. Without the usage of
  `set -e`, there is a possiblity that your\nbash script may return a zero exit code
  even if your intermediate\ncommand resulted in an error.\n\nAfter creating a configuration
  file as above, deploying is as simple as:\n\n```bash\n$ hap deploy\n```\n\nRollback
  is also trivial:\n\n```bash\n$ hap rollback # to rollback to previous successful
  deploy\n$ hap rollback -n 2 # go two deploys back in time, etc.\n```\n\n## What
  to do when compiling on server is not viable\n\nSometimes the target machine (server)
  is not capable of compiling your\napplication because e.g. it has not enough memory
  and GHC exhausts it all.\nYou can copy pre-compiled files from local machine or
  CI server using\n`copy_files` and `copy_dirs` parameters:\n\n```haskell\ncopy_files:\n
  \ - src: '/home/stackbuilders/my-file.txt'\n    dest: 'my-file.txt'\ncopy_dirs:\n
  \ - src: .stack-work\n    dest: .stack-work\n```\n\n`src` maybe absolute or relative,
  it's path to file or directory on local\nmachine, `dest` may only be relative (it's
  expanded relatively to cloned\nrepo) and specifies where to put the files/directories
  on target machine.\nDirectories and files with clashing names will be overwritten.
  Directories\nare copied recursively.\n\n## Deploying to multiple machines concurrently\n\nBeginning
  with Hapistrano 0.3.1.0 it's possible to deploy to several\nmachines concurrently.
  The only things you need to do is to adjust your\nconfiguration file and use `targets`
  parameter instead of `host` and `port`,\nlike this:\n\n```haskell\ntargets:\n  -
  host: myserver-a.com\n    port: 2222\n  - host: myserver-b.com\n# the rest is the
  same…\n```\n\nA few things to note here:\n\n* `host` item is required for every
  target, but `port` may be omitted and\n  then it defaults to `22`.\n\n* The deployment
  will run concurrently and finish when interactions with all\n  targets have finished
  either successfully or not. If at least one\n  interaction was unsuccessful, the
  `hap` tool will exit with non-zero exit\n  code.\n\n* The log is printed in such
  a way that messages from several machines get\n  intermixed, but it's guaranteed
  that they won't overlap (printing itself\n  is sequential) and the headers will
  tell you exactly which machine was\n  executing which command.\n\nIf you don't specify
  `host` and `targets`, `hap` will assume `localhost` as\nusually, which is mainly
  useful for testing.\n\n## Docker\n\nIf you would like to use Docker, there is a
