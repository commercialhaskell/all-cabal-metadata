  # Hapistrano

  Hapistrano is a deployment library for Haskell applications similar to
  Ruby's [Capistrano](http://capistranorb.com/).

  ## Purpose

  We created Hapistrano because:

  * Deploys should be simple, but as close to atomic as possible (eg,
    they shouldn't require much application downtime).
  * Rollback should be trivial to achieve to bring the application back
    to the last-deployed state.
  * Deploys shouldn't fail because of dependency problems.

  ## How it Works

  Hapistrano (like Capistrano for Ruby) deploys applications to a new
  directory marked with a timestamp on the remote host. It creates this
  new directory quickly by placing a git repository for caching purposes
  on the remote server.

  When the build process completes, it switches a symlink to the `current`
  release directory, and optionally restarts the web server.

  By default, Hapistrano keeps the last five releases on the target host
  filesystem and deletes previous releases to avoid filling up the disk.

  ## Usage

  Hapistrano 0.3.0.0 looks for a configuration file called `hap.yaml` that
  typically looks like this:

  ```yaml
  deploy_path: '/var/projects/my-project'
  host: myserver.com
  port: 2222
  repo: 'https://github.com/stackbuilders/hapistrano.git'
  revision: origin/master
  build_script:
    - stack setup
    - stack build
  restart_command: systemd restart my-app-service
  ```

  The following parameters are required:

  * `deploy_path` — the root of the deploy target on the remote host.
  * `repo` — the origin repository.
  * `revision` — the SHA1 or branch to deploy. If a branch, you will need to
    specify it as `origin/branch_name` due to the way that the cache repo is
    configured.

  The following parameters are *optional*:

  * `host` — the target host, if missing, `localhost` will be assumed (which
    is useful for testing and playing with `hap` locally).
  * `port` — SSH port number to use. If missing, 22 will be used.
  * `shell` — Shell to use. Currently supported: `zsh` ans `bash`. If missing, `Bash` will be used.
  * `ssh_args` — Optional ssh arguments. Only `-p` is passed via the `port` variable.
  * `build_script` — instructions how to build the application in the form of
    shell commands.
  * `restart_command` — if you need to restart a remote web server after a
    successful rollback, specify the command that you use in this variable. It
    will be run after both deploy and rollback.
  * `vc_action` - Controls if version control related activity should
    take place. It defaults to true. When you don't want activity like
    cloning, fetching etc. to take place, set this to `false`.
  * `linux` - Specify, whether or not, the target system where Hapistrano will
    deploy to is a GNU/Linux or other UNIX (g.e. BSD, Mac). This is set to `true`
    by default so unless the target system is not GNU/Linux, this should not be
    necessary. The platform where Hapistrano is running won't affect the
    available options for commands (g.e. A Mac deploying to a Ubuntu machine,
    doesn't need this flag)
  * `release_format` - The release timestamp format, the
    '--release-format' argument passed via the CLI takes precedence over this
    value. If neither CLI or configuration file value is specified, it defaults
    to 'short'
  * `keep_releases` - The number of releases to keep, the
    '--keep-releases' argument passed via the CLI takes precedence over this
    value. If neither CLI or configuration file value is specified, it defaults
    to '5'
  * `linked_files:`- Listed files that will be symlinked from the `{deploy_path}/shared` folder
  into each release directory during deployment. Can be used for configuration files
  that need to be persisted (e.g. dotenv files).  **NOTE:** The directory structure _must_
  be similar in your release directories in case you need to link a file inside a
  nested directory (e.g. `shared/foo/file.txt`).
  * `linked_dirs:`- Listed directories that will be symlinked from the `{deploy_path}/shared` folder
  into each release directory during deployment. Can be used for data directories
  that need to be persisted (e.g. upload directories). **NOTE:** Do not add a slash `/`
  at the end of the directory (e.g. `foo/`) because we use `parseRelFile` to create
  the symlink.
  * `run_locally:`- Instructions to run locally on your machine in the
    form of shell commands. Example:

  ```
  run_locally:
    - pwd
    - bash deploy.sh
  ```

  Note how we are even able to execute a bash script named `deploy.sh`
  above. Be sure to use `set -e` in your bash script to avoid
  headaches. Hapistrano will stop the execution on non zero exit
  codes. Without the usage of `set -e`, there is a possiblity that your
  bash script may return a zero exit code even if your intermediate
  command resulted in an error.

  After creating a configuration file as above, deploying is as simple as:

  ```bash
  $ hap deploy
  ```

  Rollback is also trivial:

  ```bash
  $ hap rollback # to rollback to previous successful deploy
  $ hap rollback -n 2 # go two deploys back in time, etc.
  ```

  ### Environment Variables

  Configuration files are parsed using
  [loadYamlSettings](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/yaml-0.10.2.0/docs/Data-Yaml-Config.html#v:loadYamlSettings),
  therefore, variable substitution is supported. Considering the following configuration file:

  ```yaml
  revision: "_env:HAPISTRANO_REVISION:origin/master
  ...
  ```

  The `revision` value could be overwritten as follows:

  ```sh
  HAPISTRANO_REVISION=origin/feature_branch hap deploy
  ```

  ## What to do when compiling on server is not viable

  Sometimes the target machine (server) is not capable of compiling your
  application because e.g. it has not enough memory and GHC exhausts it all.
  You can copy pre-compiled files from local machine or CI server using
  `copy_files` and `copy_dirs` parameters:

  ```haskell
  copy_files:
    - src: '/home/stackbuilders/my-file.txt'
      dest: 'my-file.txt'
  copy_dirs:
    - src: .stack-work
      dest: .stack-work
  ```

  `src` maybe absolute or relative, it's path to file or directory on local
  machine, `dest` may only be relative (it's expanded relatively to cloned
  repo) and specifies where to put the files/directories on target machine.
  Directories and files with clashing names will be overwritten. Directories
  are copied recursively.

  ## Deploying to multiple machines concurrently

  Beginning with Hapistrano 0.3.1.0 it's possible to deploy to several
  machines concurrently. The only things you need to do is to adjust your
  configuration file and use `targets` parameter instead of `host` and `port`,
  like this:

  ```haskell
  targets:
    - host: myserver-a.com
      port: 2222
    - host: myserver-b.com
  # the rest is the same…
  ```

  A few things to note here:

  * `host` item is required for every target, but `port` may be omitted and
    then it defaults to `22`.

  * The deployment will run concurrently and finish when interactions with all
    targets have finished either successfully or not. If at least one
    interaction was unsuccessful, the `hap` tool will exit with non-zero exit
    code.

  * The log is printed in such a way that messages from several machines get
    intermixed, but it's guaranteed that they won't overlap (printing itself
    is sequential) and the headers will tell you exactly which machine was
    executing which command.

  If you don't specify `host` and `targets`, `hap` will assume `localhost` as
  usually, which is mainly useful for testing.
