changelog: |+
  0.3.2 [2024.12.04]
  ------------------
  * Drop support for pre-8.0 versions of GHC.

  0.3.1 [2021-01-04]
  ------------------
  * Downgraded testing claims that NaNs will round-trip, as 32-bit GHCs aren't fulfilling that promise.
    Now we merely claim that a NaN will return as a NaN.
  * Always provide `NFData Half` instance
  * Add `Binary Half` instance
  * Explicitly mark module as `Trustworthy`
  * Fix `isInfinite`
  * Add experimental support for GHCJS, add pure conversion functions.

  0.3
  ---
  * Fixed bound in `floatRange`.
  * Fixed `decodeFloat`.
  * Added a `Lift` instance for `Half` for `template-haskell` support.

  0.2.2.3
  -------
  * Avoid the new warnings for missing pattern synonym signatures on GHC 8

  0.2.2.2
  -------
  * Fixed an issue with `Storable` that was causing crashing for some users.

  0.2.2.1
  -------
  * Added support for older GHCs still. `unsafeShiftR` was only added in 7.4.

  0.2.2
  -----
  * Fixed `isInfinite`.
  * Added support for older GHCs. On GHC < 7.8 the pattern synonyms are disabled.

  0.2.1
  -----
  * Removed need for `GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving` and `ScopedTypeVariables`.

  0.2.0.1
  -------
  * Fixed source repository location

  0.2
  ---
  * Renamed `toFloat` to `fromHalf` for easier unqualified use.
  * Added a `Read` instance.

  0.1.1
  -----
  * Added a `CTYPE` to the Half declaration so that it can be used with `CApiFFI` as an unsigned short.

  0.1
  ---
  * Initial release

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/half.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/half) [![Build Status](https://github.com/ekmett/half/workflows/Haskell-CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ekmett/half/actions?query=workflow%3AHaskell-CI)

  This package supplies half-precision floating point values w/ 1 bit of sign, 5 bits of exponent, 11 bits of mantissa trailing a leading 1 bit with proper underflow.

  These arise commonly in GPU applications.
