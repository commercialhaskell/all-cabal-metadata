description: "This is a thin haskell wrapper around the CMPH library, obtainable at
  http://cmph.sf.net.\nI assume you have it installed in /usr/local/lib.\n\nThe motivation
  is mostly speed, and wren thornton's bytestring-trie seems to be the main competition:\n\n%
  ./dist/build/benchmark_trie/benchmark_trie\n* trie lookup:   1.136ns per iteration
  / 880403.98 per second.\n\n% ./dist/build/benchmark/benchmark          \n* perfect
  lookup:   0.687ns per iteration / 1456455.69 per second.\n\nit also uses less space
  in the haskell heap, building once and doing the same number of lookups:\n\nPerfectHash:\n\ttotal
  alloc = 2,525,223,964 bytes  (excludes profiling overheads)\n\nTrie:\n\ttotal alloc
  = 9,806,202,096 bytes  (excludes profiling overheads)\n\nalthough this is not an
  entirely fair comparison given how much PerfectHash stores on the C side.\n"
