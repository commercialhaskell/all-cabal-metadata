  This package contains functions for performing in-place Fisher--Yates
  shuffles on mutable and immutable vectors along with some related
  functionality. The shuffles are uniform at random amongst all
  permuations.

  For an example of how to use it:

  @
  module Main where

  import Data.Vector
  import Immutable.Shuffle

  main :: IO ()
  main = do {
  shuffleMyVector >>= print;
  cycleMyVector   >>= print;
  derangeMyVector >>= print;
  }

  myVector :: Vector Int
  myVector = fromList [1..10]

  shuffleMyVector :: IO (Vector Int)
  shuffleMyVector = shuffleM myVector

  cycleMyVector :: IO (Vector Int)
  cycleMyVector = maximalCycleM myVector

  derangeMyVector :: IO (Vector Int)
  derangeMyVector = derangementM myVector
  @

  This gives the following:

  @
  >>> main
  [2,8,1,5,10,9,7,3,6,4]
  [6,8,4,10,9,2,5,7,3,1]
  [8,5,4,1,10,9,3,6,2,7]

  >>> main
  [7,9,3,5,10,6,8,1,2,4]
  [2,4,10,7,8,1,5,9,3,6]
  [4,8,5,2,7,3,9,6,10,1]
