description: |
  PEZ is a generic zipper library. It uses lenses from the "fclabels" package to
  reference a \"location\" to move to in the zipper. The zipper is restricted to
  types in the 'Typeable' class, allowing the user to \"move up\" through complex data
  structures such as mutually-recursive types.

  Both the Typeable class and fclabels lenses can be derived in GHC, making it
  easy for the programmer to use a zipper with a minimum of boilerplate.

  Please send any feature requests or bug reports along.
