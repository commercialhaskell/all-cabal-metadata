description: Persistence is a topological data analysis library motivated by flexibility
  when it comes to the type of data being analyzed. If you have data that comes with
  a meaningful function into something of the Ord typeclass, you can use Persistence
  to detect clusters and holes in the data. You can also use the library to analyze
  the topology of directed\/undirected weighted\/unweighted graphs, and compare topologies
  of different data sets.
