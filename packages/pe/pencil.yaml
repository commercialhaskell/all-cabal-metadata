  # CHANGELOG

  All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

  ## [Unreleased]

  ## [1.0.1]

  Tests were failing from the sdist distribution due to missing files in
  `extra-source-files`. Add them.

  ## [1.0.0]

  This is a milestone release! Version 1.0.0. Several breaking changes, but if you
  read through the changes below, you should find updating your code to be pretty
  easy. Please email me if you are having problems!

  ### Added
  - Added GHC 8.4 and 8.6 support.
  - Added `(<<|)` and `coll` to add collection values into structrues.
  - Added `useFilePath`, `escapeXml`, `rename`, `to`, `move` to manipulate loaded `Page`s.
  - Added `loadAndRender` convenience method. Supports individual files and
    directories. You'll want to use this one to move over static assets quickly
    and easily: `loadAndRender "images/"`.
  - Added `toTextRss` and `rfc822DateFormat` to render content ready for an RSS
    template. See the Blog example for details.

  ### Changed
  - All of the `Pencil.Blog` functions are now re-exported in `Pencil`. So you
    only need to `import Pencil` now.
  - `load` now automatically figures out the desired final FilePath, so it
    doesn't take a `(FilePath -> FilePath)` as the first argument anymore. You
    can change your code from `load toHtml "foo.markdown"` to `load
    "foo.markdown"`, for the most part. Use `load'` to manually specify the
    FilePath transform. See examples in the Hackage docs for `load'`, `to`,
    `move` and `rename`.
  - `loadResources`, like `load`, no longers takes a file path transformer. Use
    `to`, `move` or `rename` to change the file path. But really, you probably can
    use `loadDir` or `loadDir'` or `loadAndRender` instead of `loadResources.`
  - Renamed `structure` to `struct`. It's shorter.
  - `passthrough` now works with directories too.
  - `insertPages` return type changed from `Env` to `PencilApp Env`. We now
    evaluate the given pages (e.g. replace variables) before inserting into
    env. So you'll need to change from `let env' = insertPages "posts" posts env`
    to `env <- insertPages "posts" posts env`.
  - Renamed `updateEnvVal` to `adjust`.
  - Renamed `insertEnv` to `insert`.
  - Renamed `injectTagsEnv` to `injectTags`.
  - Renamed `arrayContainsString` to `arrayContainsText`.
  - Changed how structures work internally to allow collection values into structures.
  - Examples now match the tutorials. This is the start of merging the tutorials into the pencil
    repo itself, instead of living somewhere else.
  - Two new errors: `CollectionNotLastInStructure` and
    `CollectionFirstInStructure` to handle collection positions in structures.

  ### Fixed
  - Specify example test files in the pencil.cabal file, so that pencil tests run properly.

  ### Removed
  - `renderCss`. Use `loadAndRender` instead. As in: `loadAndRender "style.scss"`
  - Removed `VarNotInEnv` error type, since Pencil no longer throws that.

  ## [0.1.3]

  ### Changed
  - Updated dependencies. Should be able to use with recent versions of Stack LTS releases and Nix channels.
  - Pandoc updated to 2.5 from 1.x. Source code renders using `<a>` tags now, so you may have to change your CSS. If you want
    CSS to target only `<a href>` tags, use `a[href] { ... }`.

  ## [0.1.2]

  ### Added
  - Escape template directives using `$${example}`. This will be rendered
    literally as `${example}`.

  ## [0.1.1]

  ### Added
  - Blog example.
  - Minor method changes.

  ### Changed
  - Bounds changed for ghc 8.0.2 and 8.2.2 support.
  - Improved documentation.

  # Pencil

  Pencil is a static site generator. Use Pencil to build a personal website, a
  blog, and more. Pencil comes pre-loaded with goodies such as Markdown and
  Sass/Scss support, templating, blogging, and tagging. Designed with the
  Haskell beginner in mind, but flexible enough to extend for your own needs.

  The easiest way to get started is to read the tutorials at
  [elbenshira.com/pencil](http://elbenshira.com/pencil) and reference the [Haddock
  docs](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pencil).

  > The blue-backed notebooks, the two pencils and the pencil sharpener... the
  > marble topped tables, the smell of early morning... and luck were all you
  > needed. â€” Ernest Hemingway, A Moveable Feast

  # Examples

  Here's an example that shows a personal website with a blog and an RSS feed.
  Based off the [this
  example](https://github.com/elben/pencil/tree/master/examples/Simple).

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

  module Main where

  import Pencil

  config :: Config
  config =
    updateEnv (insertText "title" "My Awesome Website") defaultConfig

  website :: PencilApp ()
  website = do
    layout <- load "layout.html"
    index <- load "index.markdown"
    render (layout <|| index)

    loadAndRender "stylesheet.scss"

  main :: IO ()
  main = run website config
  ```

  You can check out other [examples](https://github.com/elben/pencil/tree/master/examples). The [Blog](https://github.com/elben/pencil/tree/master/examples/Blog) is a good one.

  My personal website (http://elbenshira.com) uses Pencil ([source here](https://github.com/elben/elben.github.io)). And so does Pencil's website at [elbenshira.com/pencil](http://elbenshira.com/pencil) ([source here](https://github.com/elben/pencil/tree/master/examples/Docs)).
