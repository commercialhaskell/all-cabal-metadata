  # persistent-discover

  ![build status](https://github.com/parsonsmatt/persistent-discover/actions/workflows/haskell.yml/badge.svg)


  Supports automatic discovery of your
  [`persistent`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/persistent) models.

  ## As an executable

  Let's say you've got a ton of `persistent` database models, all defined in a
  module hierarchy like this:

  ```
  src/
    Models/
      Foo.hs
      Bar.hs
      Baz.hs
      Blargh.hs
      What.hs
      OhNo.hs
  ```

  If you're using `persistent` to automatically generate migrations, you'll want
  to have all the `[EntityDef]` in scope from each module. You can do that by
  importing each module that defines models and calling `$(discoverEntities)`,
  introduced in `persistent-2.13`.

  But you may forget to import a module.

  This utility imports *all* the modules defined in the current directory and
  sub-directories, and then it calls `$(discoverEntities)` for you.

  To use it, place the following command in a file, located in the same directory
  that your Haskell modules are in:

  ```
  {-# OPTIONS_GHC -F -pgmF persistent-discover #-}
  ```

  Let's say we put that in `src/Models/All.hs`.
  This generates a module `Models.All` that exports a single item: `allEntities`,
  which is a `[EntityDef]` and can be used by `migrateModels` to properly perform
  migrations.

  You'll need to add `persistent-discover` to the `build-tool-depends` on your cabal file
  for this to work.
