description: |
  This library includes data types for storing permutations and
  combinations.  It implements pure and impure types, the latter of
  which can be modified in-place.  The library uses aggressive
  inlining and MutableByteArray#s internally, so it is very
  efficient.

  The main utility of the library is converting between the linear
  representation of a permutation and a sequence of swaps.  This
  allows, for instance, applying a permutation or its inverse
  to an array with O(1) memory use.

  Much of the interface for the library is based on the permutation
  and combination functions in the GNU Scientific Library (GSL).
