description: "# PenroseKiteDart\n\nAuthor: Chris Reade\n\nMarch 2021 - 2024\n\nSee
  LICENSE file\n\n## Penrose Kites and Darts\n\nPenrose\\'s kite and dart tiles have
  the property that they can tile the entire plane aperiodicly.\nThere are rules to
  ensure legal tilings with the kites and darts.\nTilings can still get stuck (so
  cannot be continued to cover the entire plane) - these are called incorrect.\n\nThis
  package is a Haskell library of tools to build, draw and explore finite tilings
  with kites and darts, making use of the \nHaskell Diagrams package.\n\n## Using
  the Package\n\nYou will need the Haskell Diagrams package\nto be installed as well
  as this package (PenroseKiteDart). (See [Haskell Diagrams](https://diagrams.github.io)).\nOnce
  installed, a Main.hs module to produce diagrams should import a chosen backend for
  Diagrams such as the default (SVG)\nalong with Diagrams.Prelude\n\n    module Main
  (main) where\n    \n    import Diagrams.Backend.SVG.CmdLine\n    import Diagrams.Prelude\n\nplus
  (for Penrose Kite and Dart tilings)\n\n    import PKD\n\nand optionally\n\n    import
  TgraphExamples\n\nThen to ouput someExample figure\n\n    fig::Diagram B\n    fig
  = someExample\n\n    main :: IO ()\n    main = mainWith fig\n\nWhen the code is
  executed it will generate an SVG file.\n(See the Haskell Diagrams package for more
  details on producing diagrams.)\n\n## Tgraphs to Describe Finite Tilings\n\nTile
  Graphs (`Tgraph`s) use a simple planar graph representation for finite patches of
  tiles.\nA `Tgraph` is made from a list of faces with type `TileFace` each of which
  is a half-dart or a half-kite.\nEach `TileFace` is thus a triangle with three positive
  Int vertices and a constructor\n`LD` (left dart), `RD` (right dart), `LK` (left
  kite), `RK` (right kite).\n\nFor example a fool consists of two kites and a dart
  (= 4 half kites and 2 half darts):\n\n    fool :: Tgraph\n    fool = makeTgraph
  [RD (1,2,3),LD (1,3,4)   -- right and left dart\n                      ,LK (5,3,2),RK
  (5,2,7)   -- left and right kite\n                      ,RK (5,4,3),LK (5,6,4)   --
  right and left kite\n                      ]\n\nThe function\n\n    makeTgraph ::
  [TileFace] -> Tgraph\n\nperforms checks to make sure the tiling is legal, raising
  an error if there is a problem.\nTo produce a diagram, we simply draw the `Tgraph`\n\n
  \   foolFigure :: Diagram B\n    foolFigure = labelled draw fool\n\n\n## Modules\n\nModule
  `PKD` is the main module which imports and rexports `Tgraphs` and `TileLib`.\n`Tgraphs`
  imports and re-exports the contents of the other Tgraph modules, namely \n`Tgraph.Compose`,
  `Tgraph.Decompose`, `Tgraph.Force`, `Tgraph.Relabelling`, `Tgraph.Prelude`.\n`TileLib`
  contains underlying drawing tools for tiles.\n`Tgraph.Try` is imported and re-exported
  by `Tgraph.Prelude` - used for results of partial functions.\n`HalfTile` is imported
  and re-exported by `Tgraph.Prelude` -  (with the constructors `LD`,`RD`,`LK`,`RK`).\n\n##
