  # Changelog for B9

  ## 0.5.66

  * Fix the Nix package:

    * Get rid of the virsh path configuration item

    * Allow setting the path to @/.../libexec/libvirt_lxc@ via environment variable

  ## 0.5.65

  * Refactor the B9 Monad to use `extensible-effects`

  ## 0.5.64

  * Refactor and prepare for more drastic changes

  * Fix runtime errors due to `undefined` values in the environment

  ## 0.5.63

  * Depend on `shake-0.17.6` to fix build errors

  ## 0.5.62

  * Rewrite `B9.Shake.SharedImageRules` in line with
    Shake's example for custom rules

  * Replace `ConcatableSyntax` by using `Binary` instances, and also

    * Remove/Inline `encodeSyntax` by using `Binary.encode`

    * Rename `decodeSyntax` to `decodeOrFail'` and delegate to `Binary.decodeOrFail`.

  * Add a newtype wrapper around `YamlObject` for **cloud-init** yaml documents
    `CloudConfigYaml`

    This new type serves the purpose of add the `#cloud-config`
    line to the top of the generated yaml document,
    as [required by cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/format.html#cloud-config-data).

    The `Binary` instance adds this **header line** and
    delegates the rendering of the yaml document to
    `YamlObject`.

  * Remove the rendering of this header line in the `YamlObject`
    `Binary` instance.

  * Rename `RenderYaml` to `RenderYamlObject` In order to prevent unexpected
    runtime behaviour in code that uses this library.

  * Introduce the type `Environment` that replaces the ubiquotus `[(String, String)]`
    by a lazy `Text` based `HashMap`.

  * Add `addLocalPositionalArguments`

  * Rename the previous `B9.Artifact.Content` to `B9.Artifact.Content`

  * Introduce `ContentGenerator` as an open, extensible alternative
    to `Content`, `AST` and `CanRender` in the module
    `B9.Artifact.Content`
  * Rename-and-Split refactor `B9.ArtifactSource{Impl}` to `B9.Artifact.Generator.{..}`

  * Move `CanRender` from `B9.Artifact.Content.AST` to `B9.Artifact.Content`

  * Switch to lazy `Text`s and `ByteString`s where possible, since B9 might
    read/generate large files.

  * Rename `CanRender` to `ToContentGenerator`
    and change the method signatur to return the new `ContentGenerator` type

  * Fix spelling: Rename B9Invokation to B9Invocation

  * Rename `FromAST` to `FromAST`

  * Rearrange modules for content generation:

    * Introduce `Content.FromByteString`

    * Remove deprecated `Concatenation`

  # B9 - A Benign VM-Build Tool

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sheyll/b9-vm-image-builder.svg?branch=0.5)](https://travis-ci.org/sheyll/b9-vm-image-builder) [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/badge/hackage-B9-green.svg?style=flat)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/b9) [![b9 LTS](http://stackage.org/package/b9/badge/lts)](http://stackage.org/lts/package/b9)

  Use B9 to compile your software into a deployable set of Linux-VM- or
  configuration images, from a set of scripts and input files and templates

  The main goal of this tool is to provide a build tool to increase automation and
  reduce redundancy when creating configured, ready-to-run VM-images.

  It is designed to help implementing what's buzz-worded as _immutable_
  infrastructure, by making whole-VM-deployments as safe and a fast as possible.

  B9 does not bring infrastructure to run and connect any VM-image in production,
  it is merely a build tool to assemble deployable artifacts.

  One big thing is that it can produce many machines and cloud-configs from a
  single build file, because build files can describe concrete as well as
  parameterized generators. It can create parameterized VM-Images by uploading
  (e.g. system-)files assembled by syntax aware template application and
  combination, all statically checked by during the build.

  This sets B9 apart from e.g. cloud-init or other configuration management
  systems that provide configuration via user provided dynamic script-programs,
  which rely on the user to contain correct error handling.

  The general idea is the same as in statically type programming languages: catch
  errors as early as possible without relying on the user to create a covering set
  of tests/error checks.

  Certain sacrifies were made; there might be a steep laerning curve, but you will
  eventually get there. The tool at hand works stable and reliable. The build
  files are check rigorously, all builds happen in a random build directory and
  failure leaves no stale LXC-containers running or multiple GiB of temporary disk
  image files around. Also, there is no way modify an existing image in
  place. Work on VM-Images is always done on a copy of an image, and to speed
  things up, it is possible to explicitly use copy-on-write images.

  B9 creates bootable virtual machine images, without necessarily using
  virtualization itself.

  In essence B9 is a tool for _creation_, _configuration_ and _sharing_ of VM images and
  all peripheral artifacts, it creates:

  * VMDK/QCOW2/Raw VM images
  * Converted, extracted and resized copies of existing vm images
  * Empty VM images with extended 4 file system
  * Cloud-Config Images
  * Text files from template files with variable interpolation
  * Erlang OTP sys.config files
  * beqemu-life-installer compatible VM images

  B9 creates/converts/assembles virtual disk images as well as any number of
  config-input files and executes scripts in LXC containers into which these
  images are mounted.

  The input is in both cases a single, text-based configuration file wich can be
  put along side with other build files (e.g. Makefiles, maven poms, ...).

  ## Some Random Features:

  * Tailored for both software compilation environments and VM image creation
  * Creation of cloud-init (NoCloud) ISO images, VFAT images and directories
  * Assembly and creation of arbitrary files with safe variable interpolation
  * Creation of multiple images/machines/cloud-configs based on creation rules
  * Syntax-checked merging of several cloud-config yaml user-data files with
    variable expansion
  * Syntax-checked parsing and recombination of Erlang/OTP sys.config files with
    variable expansion
  * Reusing and Sharing of vm-images, e.g. via The Internet using 'push' and 'pull'
  * Arbitrary command execution inside a guest container
  * Execution of interactive commands inside guest containers
  * Create empty VM Images with file system
  * Builtin config file formatter
  * Create CopyOnWrite-Images backed by existing QCow2 or Raw images
  * Create disk images from other disk image
  * Derive disk images from a partition inside of an existing disk image
  * Transparent support for QCOW2, VMDK and Raw (intermediate images will have the appropriate formats)
  * Resize images and optionally also file systems inside disk images
  * Support for 64-bit and 32-bit guests
  * Share directories with the host
  * Haskell library for parsing the config files and running builds
  * Speed: Smart disk image conversion, raw image preference, flexible configuration, simple profiling
  * Configurable Logging
  * Automatic build clean-up
  * Configurable LibVirtLXC parameters
  * Configurable remote (ssh with pubkey auth + rsync) image shareing
  * Local caching of shared images

  ## Installation

  ### b9 executable and library

  Install via `stack`:

      $ stack install b9

  ### Runtime dependencies

  To be able to use B9 install:

  * Linux
  * lxc
  * libvirt with lxc support (libvirt-driver-lxc, libvirt-daemon-lxc,...)
  * virsh
  * qemu
  * ext4 tools
  * genisoimage
  * mtools
  * vfat tools
  * ssh
  * rsync
  * bash
  * wget
  * sudo

  B9 has been tested with libvirt version 1.2.12.

  Make sure that all neccessary daemons, e.g. `libvirtd.service`, `lxc.service`,..
  are active, that SELinux is configured correctly and that the `nbd` kernel
  module is loaded.

  If neccessary create a libvirt network configuration, e.g. by using
  the GUI front-end`virt-manager`.

  Depending upon the libvirt and lxc configuration of the system it might be
  nessary to allow the user, that will execute `b9c`, password-less `sudo` for
  these commands:

  * `virsh`
  * `rm`
  * `cat`
  * `cp`
  * `mv`

  After installing B9 (either from a binary package or by building from source)
  all its glory is availbe through a single executable called `b9c`.

  When `b9c` is started for the first time, it creates a configuration file in
  the users home directory called `~/.b9/b9.conf`. The path to that file can be
  changed using command line arguments. Execute:

      b9c -h

  for a list of command line parameters and commands.

  `b9c` command line arguments always follow this pattern:

      b9c <global-options> <command> <command-options> -- <build-script-extra-args>

  To enable B9 to work correctly on your machine edit the config file and make
  necessary adaptions.

  ## B9 configuration file

  This is an example of a B9 configuration file, by default found in
  `~/.b9/b9.conf`:

      [global]
      # optional alternative directory for temporary build files. If 'Nothing'
      # the current directory is used.
      build_dir_root: Just "/home/sven/tmp"
      environment_vars: []
      exec_env: LibVirtLXC
      keep_temp_dirs: False
      # if set to 'Just "filename"
      log_file: Nothing
      profile_file: Nothing
      unique_build_dirs: True
      verbosity: Just LogInfo

      [libvirt-lxc]
      connection: lxc:///
      emulator_path: /usr/lib/libvirt/libvirt_lxc
      # contains `Just "libvirt-network-name"` or `Nothing` for your libvirt
      # default network settings
      network: Nothing
      use_sudo: True
      virsh_path: /usr/bin/virsh

  Some of the options can also be specified on the command line.

  # Writing B9 build files

  If you really need to write these file, you are basically f'ed.

  For now, look at existing config files and read the sources, if anything,
  make sure to read at least the chapter _Anger-Management_ before throwing stuff
  around.

  More documentation is comming soon!

  ## General Structure

  A B9 configuration describes a single `ArtifactGenerator`. It generates files
  belonging to a VM, such as qcow2/raw/vmdk-image file(s) and e.g. cloud-init ISO
  image files.

  Just to recap: a `something.b9` build file _is_ always ever only a mere
  `ArtifactGenerator` literal, no matter how many `Let`, `Each`, `Artifacts`,
  etc... you see flying around there.

  ## Creating artifacts

  To get any _real_ artifact out of an artifact generator use the `Artifact`
  constructor. It takes _2_ parameters an arbitrary id and a describtion of what
  the artifact consists of:

       Artifact (IID "some_instance_id")
                (VmImages ... | CloudInit ...)

  An artifact can either be a (set of) VM-disk-image(s) likely in combination
  with some shell script to install software, etc _or_ a static collection of
  files put on a cloud-init image(VFAT or ISO or directory).

  ### Defining artifact generators that produce vm image files

  To produce vm image files, e.g. with some software installed use the `VmImages`
  artifact generator. It has only _2_ parameters:

       VmImages
          [ ... disk image targets ... ]
          ( ... installation script ...)

  Of course it must be wrapped in an `Artifact` definition, so we get this structure:

       Artifact (IID "my_first_image")
         (VmImages [...] (...))

  #### ImageTargets

  The first argument to `VmImages` is a list of `ImageTarget`. Each describes
  a single VM-disk-image. The syntax is:

      ImageTarget
        ImageDestination
        ImageSource
        MountPoint

  * An `ImageDestination` specifies if/where to put the output image.
  * An `ImageSource` specifies how the image is created or from where it is taken.
  * A `MountPoint` specifies where to mount the image during the execution of an
    optional `VmBuild`-script.

  ### Parameterized artifact generators

  B9 supports `$varnam` variable interpolation in all strings anywhere in an
  `ArtifactGenerator`:

  * All filenames and paths
  * All id strings and names
  * Template files included via e.g. `Template`
  * In every string in `VmScript`s (e.g. in `Run "${cmd}" ["${world}"]`)
  * Also in all included template files (e.g. included via `Template`)

  Parameters can be defined using `Let`, `Each` and special command line
  arguments.

  To pass parameters via the command line, append them after the argument delimiter
  option `--` which ends the list of regular b9c arguments:

      b9c -v build -f file1.b9 .. -- arg_1 arg_2 ...

  The parameters are bound to `${arg_1}`, `${arg_2}`, that is variables indicating
  the corresponding _position_ on the command line.

  To define variables using `Let`, write:

      Let [key-value-pairs, ...]
          [artifactgenerators, ...]

  All key-value bindings defined in the first list are available in every artifact
  generator contained in the second list (_body_).

  A key-value binding, e.g. `("hostname", "www.acme.org")`, consist of two strings
  on parens seperated by a `,` (comma). The left string is the key, and the right
  string is the value.

  This `("webserver", "www.${domainname}")` is an example to show that the _value_
  may also contain a variable reference. (Of course, only to variabled defined
  _before_)

  ## Anger-Management

  B9 build files contain a single literal `ArtifactGenerator` value
  in Haskell syntax. B9 currently 'parses' the config file without any
  error checking, so writing config files is VERY frustrating without
  some tricks:

  ### Trick 1

  Start with a working file and run

      b9c reformat -f <filename>

  after each modification. The `reformat` command only parses and - hence the
  name - (re-) formats/pretty-prints the files passed with `-f` options.

  You will immediately know if a modification broke the file.

  NOTE: If your build file refers to any `${arg_...}` positional arguments pass
  them to `reformat` using `--` followed by the argument list.

  ### Trick 2

  Obtain and build the sources of B9, start an interactive haskell shell with the
  B9 code loaded and try to paste the contents of the config file to see if ghci
  accepts it. Use the ghci macros `:{` and `:}` to begin and end a multi-line input
  and paste the raw contents of the config file in question in between.

      $ cabal install
      $ cabal repl

      ... (many lines omitted) ...
