description: "# Haskell client library for Moss\n\n![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mbg/moss)\n![CI](https://github.com/mbg/moss/workflows/CI/badge.svg)\n![stackage-nightly](https://github.com/mbg/moss/workflows/stackage-nightly/badge.svg)\n[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/moss)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/moss)\n\nHaskell
  client library for [Moss](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/) which is an
  online service for checking for code similarity, primarily aimed at detecting plagiarism.
  \n\n## Example\n\nIn order to use Moss, you need to register on the [Moss website](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/).
  Once you have your access token, using the library is fairly easy:\n\n```haskell\nimport
  Stanford.Moss\n\ncfg :: MossCfg\ncfg = defaultMossCfg{\n    mossLanguage = Haskell,\n
  \   mossUser = \"[YOUR ACCESS TOKEN HERE]\"\n}\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n    url
  <- withMoss cfg $ do\n        addBaseFile \"Skeleton\" \"Skeleton.hs\"\n        addFile
  \"StudentA\" \"StudentA.hs\"\n        addFile \"StudentB\" \"StudentB.hs\"\n        query
  \"Test\"\n    print url\n```\n\nThis example establishes a connection with Moss
  using Haskell as the selected programming language. We assume that some skeleton
  code (`Skeleton.hs`) has been made available to students and relevant parts from
  that file should be ignored for plagiarism checking. The example then uploads two
  students' submissions (`StudentA.hs` and `StudentB.hs`) before telling Moss to run
  the plagiarism check with `query` which eventually returns a URL to the results.\n"
