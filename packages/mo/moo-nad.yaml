description: "# moo-nad\n\nIn [this Stack Overflow\nquestion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61642492/simplifying-the-invocation-of-functions-stored-inside-an-readert-environment),\nI
  asked how to simplify the invocation of functions stored in a `ReaderT`\nenvironment.\n\nFor
  example, when invoking a `Int -> String -> _ ()` logging function from the environment,
  I would\nlike to simply be able to write:\n\n    logic :: ReaderT EnvWithLogger
  IO ()\n    logic = do\n        self logger 7 \"this is a message\"\n\ninstead of
  something like\n\n    logic :: ReaderT EnvWithLogger IO ()\n    logic = do\n        e
  <- ask\n        liftIO $ logger e 7 \"this is a message\"\n\n(Yes, I'm aware that
  this isn't *that* big of a hassle, and that solving it might\novercomplicate other
  things. But bear with me.)\n\nThe question received [this\nanswer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61642757/1364288),
  which worked like a\ncharm. The answer also included the following comment:\n\n>
  Implementing variadics with type classes is generally frowned upon because of\n>
  how fragile they are, but it works well here because the RIO type provides a\n>
  natural base case\n\nThat got me thinking: is there a way to avoid tying the workings
  of the\nhelper typeclass to a *concrete* monad, like\n[`RIO`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio)?
  Can the call-helper code be\nmade to work with a variety of reader-like monads?\n\nAfter
  [a number of failed attempts](https://github.com/danidiaz/dep-t/issues/1)\nusing
  a typeclass-only approach, I turned to the solution explored in the\ncurrent repo:
  *abstract the monad and the environment using a [module\nsignature](https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/separate_compilation.html#module-signatures)*.\n\nThat
  signature is called [`Moo`](./lib/Moo.hsig), and the module [`Moo.Prelude`](./lib/Moo/Prelude.hs)
  provides the\n`self` and `call` helper methods.\n\n## How to use this library to
  write program logic that is polymorphic on the monad and the environment?\n\nThis
  is an alternative to the usual way of abstracting the monad using [mtl](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl).\n\nPut
  program logic into indefinite libraries which depend\non the [`Moo` module signature](./lib/Moo.hsig).
  Import [`Moo.Prelude`](./lib/Moo/Prelude.hs) for the call helpers.\n\nYou'll likely
  need to expand the base `Moo` signature through [signature\nmerging](https://github.com/danidiaz/really-small-backpack-example/tree/master/lesson3-signature-merging)
  to require extra capabilities from the monad and/or the environment.\n\n(**Note**:
  this approach is less fine-grained with respect to constraints than\nthe MTL one.
  When using MTL each individual function can have different\nconstraints. But here,
  functions from modules that import the same version of\n`Moo` will share the same
  constraints. If you want constraint differentiation,\nyou'll need to create separate
  compilation units with different \"enriched\"\nversions of `Moo`.)\n\nYou'll eventually
  need to write an implementation library that gives concrete instantiations for the
  monad and the environment.\n\nIn your executable, depend on both your program logic
  and the implementation library. The magic of [mixing matching](https://github.com/danidiaz/really-small-backpack-example/tree/master/lesson2-signatures)
  will take place, and you'll end up with a concrete version of your logic.\n\n##
  Very well; how does an actual example look like?\n\n- See the [example-logic-that-logs](./lib-example-logic-that-logs)
  internal library for an example of [abstract program logic](./lib-example-logic-that-logs/LogicThatLogs.hs)
  that imports an [enriched](./lib-example-logic-that-logs/Moo.hsig) version of `Moo`.
  \n\n- See also the [example-impl](./lib-example-impl) internal library that implements
  the `Moo` signature.\n\n- The [test suite](./test/tests.hs) creates an actual concrete
  environment and runs the program logic with it.\n\nBecause we are using Backpack,
  we need to look at how everything is wired together\nin the [cabal file](./moo-nad.cabal).
  Notice in particular how: \n\n- The program logic depends on `moo-nad` but *not*
  on the implementation.\n\n- The implementation *doesn't* depend on `moo-nad`. Implementations
  in Backpack don't depend on the signatures they implement.\n\n- The test suite depends
  on the program logic and the implementation.\n\n## caveat emptor\n\nAt the end of
  the day, this method might involve too much ceremony to be practical. \n\nFeedback
  welcome. \n\n"
