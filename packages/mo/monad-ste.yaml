  and unsafe code to .STE.Internal and marked the\n  .STE module which only provides
  safe exports as Trustworthy\n\n* Added a number of unsafe helper functions such
  as `unsafeInterleaveSTE`\nto the Internal module, as well as exposing\n\n## pre
  0.1.0.0\n\n* Thanks to Duncan Coutts for design feedback that using the\nraw `raiseIO#`
  and `catch#` primitives would simplify the core code\n\n* Thanks to Brian Schroeder
