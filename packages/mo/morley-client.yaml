    Fix gas limit computation
    + Fixes a bug where in some cases batched transfer could exceed hard gas
      limit.
  * [!1313](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1313)
    Add `contractStateResolver` getter to build Morley interpreter's
    `ContractState` from chain.
  * [!1315](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1315)
    Avoid redundant calls to octez-client address store
    + Introduce `AddressWithAlias` and ways to resolve it (i.e.

    Use RPC revealing in `runOperationsNonEmptyHelper`
    + Replace `revealKey` with `getPublicKey` in `HasTezosClient`.
    + Move `Morley.Client.Action.Common.revealKeyUnlessRevealed` to

    + Implement key revealing in `runOperationsNonEmptyHelper` via prepending the
      reveal operation to the batch.
    + Rename `Morley.Client.Action.Reveal.revealKey*` to `*Op`, since those inject
      raw revelation **op**erations.
    + Introduce utility versions of `Morley.Client.Action.Reveal.revealKey*` that
      get the key using `getPublicKey`.

  0.3.0
  =====
  * [!1281](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1281)
    Use the new binaries names, `octez-client` and `octez-node`
  * [!1270](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1270)
    Remove key prefix in reveal operation
  * [!1285](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1285)
    Make revealKey API less confusing
    + Removed redundant `sender` parameter from functions in
      `Morley.Client.Action.Reveal`. They now accept a public key and optionally
      fee instead, since the sender is uniquely determined by the public key.
  * [!1287](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1287)
    Get rid of RpcNoOperationsRun error
    + Introduce `runTransactionsNonEmpty` to `Morley.Client.Action.Transaction`.
    + Remove `RpcNoOperationsRun` constructor from `IncorrectRpcResponse` as it
      can't in fact be thrown.
  * [!1266](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1266)
    Overload `getAlias`
    + Overloaded `getAlias` and `getAliasMaybe`
      to work with `SomeAddressOrAlias`.
    + `getAlias` and `getAliasMaybe` now check that the alias actually exists.
    + Replaced the `findAddress` and `getAliasEither` methods from
      the `HasTezosClient` typeclass with `getAliasesAndAddresses`.
  * [!1259](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1259)
    More options for handling duplicate alias in morley-client
    + Added new datatype `Morley.Client.AliasBehavior`.
    + Various origination functions and datatypes now use this datatype instead of
      a boolean flag.
    + `DuplicateAlias` error is now part of `TezosClientError`.
  * [!1258](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1258)
    Support implicit contract delegates and setting delegates during origination
    + Fix a small potential bug in RPC error code decoders.
    + Parse `deleagate.already_active` error
    + Support getting delegates for implicit addresses
    + Support setting contract delegate during origination
  * [!1260](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1260)
    Add `SomeAddressOrAlias`
    + Overloaded `resolveAddress` and `resolveAddressMaybe` to work with
      `SomeAddressOrAlias`.
    + Replaced the `transfer --to-implicit` and `--to-contract` options with a
      single `--to` option.
    + Replaced the `resolveAddressMaybe` method from the `HasTezosClient`
      typeclass with `findAddress`.
  * [!1226](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1226)
    Implement delegation operation via RPC
  * [!1257](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1257)

      data (received from preapply).
    + `OpTransfer` now has a list of contract events as the result.
  * [!1210](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1210)

  # Morley-client

  This package implements a client to interact with the Tezos blockchain.
  It is intended to be used both as a library and as a tool.

  `morley-client` uses the [Tezos RPC API](https://tezos.gitlab.io/developer/rpc.html)
  to interact with a remote (or local) `octez-node` and uses the `octez-client`
  binary for some operations, such as signing and local contract manipulations.

  IMPORTANT: `morley-client` is still actively developed and unstable.
  Its interface(s) may change abruptly and it shouldn't be used for anything but testing.

  ## Command line interface

  At the moment, the `morley-client` CLI can be used to perform a handful of operations.

  You can use:
  ```sh
  morley-client --help
  ```
  to get a list of available commands and info about common options.

  You can also use:
  ```sh
  morley-client COMMAND --help
  ```
  to get more information about each of the available `COMMAND` and its options.
