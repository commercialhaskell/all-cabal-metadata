description: ! "# monad-io-adapter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cjdev/monad-io-adapter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cjdev/monad-io-adapter)\n\nThis
  Haskell package provides utilities for converting between computations parameterized
  via two different typeclasses, both of which can be used to abstract over monad
  transformer stacks with `IO` at the base. Unfortunately, both classes are frequently
  used in the Haskell ecosystem, since they have minor differences:\n\n  - `MonadIO`
  comes from the `base` package (as of `base` version 4.9.0.0), and it provides a
  `liftIO` operation. It is an extremely simple typeclass, focusing exclusively on
  lifting `IO` actions through transformer stacks with `IO` at the base.\n\n  - `MonadBase`
  comes from the `transformers-base` package, and it is a generalized version of `MonadIO`.
  It provides a more general `liftBase` function, which allows lifting to an arbitrary
  base monad.\n\n    Generally, this additional power isn’t especially useful, but
  `MonadBase` appears most often through `MonadBaseControl`, a subclass from the `monad-control`
  package that enables lifting operations that accept an action in negative position.
  This class has no `IO`-specialized equivalent (not directly, at least), so it often
  appears in lifted “control” operations.\n\nDue to these typeclasses being unrelated,
  it’s not entirely uncommon to end up with type signatures like `(MonadIO m, MonadBaseControl
  IO m) => ...`, which are a little silly, since `MonadBaseControl IO` really includes
  all the power of `MonadIO`.\n\nFor more information, [see the documentation on Hackage][monad-io-adapter].\n\n[monad-io-adapter]:
