description: "monoid-subclasses\n=================\n\n### Subclasses of Semigroup
  and Monoid with a solid theoretical foundation and practical purposes ###\n\nThe
  monoid-subclasses package has been released [on\nHackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/monoid-subclasses).
  The package defines several classes that are richer\nthan [semigroups](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Data-Semigroup.html#t:Semigroup)
  and\n[monoids](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Data-Monoid.html#t:Monoid)
  but less demanding than\n[groups](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/groups/docs/Data-Group.html):\n\n*
  [Reductive](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/monoid-subclasses/docs/Data-Semigroup-Cancellative.html#t:Reductive)\nprovides
  the operator `</>` which acts as a partial inverse of the semigroup `<>` operator.\n*
  [Cancellative](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/monoid-subclasses/docs/Data-Semigroup-Cancellative.html#t:Cancellative)\nis
  a subclass of `Reductive` that provides additional guarantees about the `</>` operation
  result:\n\n        (a <> b) </> a == Just b\n        (a <> b) </> b == Just a\n\n
  \   Every group (*i.e.*, every `Monoid a` with the operation `inverse :: a -> a`)
  is a cancellative monoid where `a </> b = Just (a <> inverse b)` but not every `Cancellative`
  monoid is a group.\n    \n* [GCDMonoid](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/monoid-subclasses/docs/Data-Monoid-GCD.html#t:GCDMonoid)
  is a subclass of `Reductive` and `Monoid` that provides the `gcd` operation for
  getting the greatest common denominator for two given monoid values.\n* [Monus](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/monoid-subclasses/docs/Data-Monus.html#t:Monus)
  provides the `<\\>` monus operation. The set difference is one familiar instance
  of this operation.\n* [MonoidNull](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/monoid-subclasses/docs/Data-Monoid-Null.html)
  class provides the Boolean `null` operation that checks if the argument monoid is
  `mempty`.\n* [Factorial](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/monoid-subclasses/docs/Data-Semigroup-Factorial.html)
  and [FactorialMonoid](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/monoid-subclasses/docs/Data-Monoid-Factorial.html)
  classes represent semigroups and monoids that can be split up into irreducible factors.\n\nThat's
  the theoretical point of view. From the practical point of view, the main purpose
  of the _monoid-subclasses_ package is similar to that of [ListLike](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ListLike/docs/Data-ListLike.html)
  - to provide unifying abstractions for various monoidal data types in Haskell, primarily
  [String](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Data-String.html#t:String),
  [ByteString](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring/docs/Data-ByteString.html#t:ByteString),
  and [Text](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/text). All three types are already
  instances of the [Monoid](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Data-Monoid.html#t:Monoid)
  class. While that abstraction is useful for building sequences of data, it doesn't
  help with deconstructing them.\n\nThat being said, there are two major differences
  in the goals of _ListLike_ and _monoid-subclasses_:\n  * _ListLike_ strives to reproduce
  the standard [Data.List](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Data-List.html)
  interface, whereas _monoid-subclasses_ builds from deeper theoretical foundations;
  and\n  * The _monoid-subclasses_ implementation uses standard Haskell 2010, with
  the exception of two minor extensions which can be worked around if necessary.\n\nThe
  [incremental-parser](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/incremental-parser) package
  can serve as a compact example\nof a parser library that can be applied to different
  input types thanks to _monoid-subclasses_. There is also\n[picoparsec](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/picoparsec),
  a fork of\n[attoparsec](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/attoparsec), and the
  heavy-duty\n[grammatical-parsers](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/grammatical-parsers)
  library.\n\nA more thorough description of the library design can be found in the
  Haskell Symposium 2013 paper [Adding Structure\nto Monoids ](https://github.com/blamario/monoid-subclasses/wiki/Files/HaskellSymposium2013.pdf)\n"
