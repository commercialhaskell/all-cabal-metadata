synopsis: Modern library for working with URIs
changelog: |
  ## Modern URI 0.3.1.0

  * Dropped support for GHC 8.0 and 7.10.

  * Added Template Haskell `Lift` instance for the `URI` type and its
    sub-components.

  ## Modern URI 0.3.0.1

  * Allow superfluous `&` right after question sign in query parameters.

  ## Modern URI 0.3.0.0

  * Uses Megaparsec 7. Visible API changes amount to an adjustment in
    definition of the `ParseException` type.

  ## Modern URI 0.2.2.0

  * Removed a potentially overlapping instance `Arbitrary (NonEmpty (RText
    'PathPiece))`.

  * Fixed a bug that made it impossible to have empty host names. This allows
    us to parse URIs like `file:///etc/hosts`.

  ## Modern URI 0.2.1.0

  * Added `emptyURI`—`URI` value representing the empty URI.

  ## Modern URI 0.2.0.0

  * Changed the type of `uriPath` field of the `URI` record from `[RText
    'PathPiece]` to `Maybe (Bool, NonEmpty (RText 'PathPiece))`. This allows
    us to store whether there is a trailing slash in the path or not. See the
    updated documentation for more information.

  * Added the `relativeTo` function.

  * Added the `uriTrailingSlash` 0-1 traversal in `Text.URI.Lens`.

  ## Modern URI 0.1.2.1

  * Allow Megaparsec 6.4.0.

  ## Modern URI 0.1.2.0

  * Fixed handling of `+` in query strings. Now `+` is parsed as space and
    serialized as `%2b` as per RFC 1866 (paragraph 8.2.1). White space in
    query parameters is serialized as `+`.

  ## Modern URI 0.1.1.1

  * Fixed implementation of `Text.URI.Lens.queryParam` traversal.

  ## Modern URI 0.1.1.0

  * Derived `NFData` for `ParseException`.

  * Adjusted percent-encoding in renders so it's only used when absolutely
    necessary. Previously we percent-escaped a bit too much, which, strictly
    speaking, did not make the renders incorrect, but that didn't look nice
    either.

  ## Modern URI 0.1.0.1

  * Updated the readme to include “Quick start” instructions and some
    examples.

  ## Modern URI 0.1.0.0

  * Changed the type of `uriAuthority` from `Maybe Authority` to `Either Bool
    Authority`. This allows to know if URI path is absolute or not without
    duplication of information, i.e. when the `Authority` component is present
    the path is necessarily absolute, otherwise the `Bool` value tells if it's
    absolute (`True`) or relative (`False`).

  * Added `isPathAbsolute` in `Text.URI` and the corresponding getter in
    `Text.URI.Lens`.

  ## Modern URI 0.0.2.0

  * Added the `renderStr` and `renderStr'` functions for efficient rendering
    to `String` and `ShowS`.

  * Added the `parserBs` that can consume strict `ByteString` streams.

  ## Modern URI 0.0.1.0

  * Initial release.

  This is a modern library for working with URIs in Haskell as per RFC 3986:

  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986

  ## Features

  The `modern-uri` package features:

  * Correct by construction `URI` data type. Correctness is ensured by
    guaranteeing that every sub-component of the `URI` record is by itself
    cannot be invalid. This boils down to careful use of types and a set of
    smart constructors for things like scheme, host, etc.
  * Textual components in the `URI` data type represented as `Text` rather
    than `ByteString`, because they are percent-decoded and so they can
    contain characters outside of ASCII range (i.e. Unicode). This allows for
    easier manipulation of `URI`s, while encoding and decoding headaches are
    handled by the parsers and renders for you.
  * Absolute and relative URIs differ only by the scheme component: if it's
    `Nothing`, then URI is relative, otherwise it's absolute.
  * Megaparsec parser that can be used as a standalone smart constructor for
    the `URI` data type (see `mkURI`) as well as be seamlessly integrated into
    a bigger Megaparsec parser that consumes strict `Text` (see `parser`) or
    strict `ByteString` (see `parserBs`).
  * The parser performs some normalization, for example it collapses
    consecutive slashes. Some smart constructors such as `mkScheme` and
    `mkHost` also perform normalization. So in a sense URIs are also
    “normalized by construction” to some extent.
  * Fast rendering to strict `Text` and `ByteString` as well as to their
    respective `Builder` types and to `String`/`ShowS`.
  * Extensive set of lensy helpers for easier manipulation of the nested data
    types (see `Text.URI.Lens`).
  * Quasi-quoters for compile-time construction of the `URI` data type and
    refined text types (see `Text.URI.QQ`).

  ## Quick start

  The `modern-uri` package serves three main purposes:

  * Construction of the `URI` data type.
  * Inspection and manipulation of the `URI` data type (in the sense of
    changing its parts).
  * Rendering of `URI`s.

  Let's walk through every operation quickly.

  ### Construction of `URI`s

  There are four ways to create a `URI` value. First off, one could assemble
  it manually like so:

  ```haskell
  λ> :set -XOverloadedStrings
  λ> import qualified Text.URI as URI
  λ> scheme <- URI.mkScheme "https"
  λ> scheme
  "https"
  λ> host <- URI.mkHost "markkarpov.com"
  λ> host
  "markkarpov.com"
  λ> let uri = URI.URI (Just scheme) (Right (URI.Authority Nothing host Nothing)) Nothing [] Nothing
  λ> uri
  URI
    { uriScheme = Just "https"
    , uriAuthority = Right
        (Authority
          { authUserInfo = Nothing
          , authHost = "markkarpov.com"
          , authPort = Nothing })
    , uriPath = Nothing
    , uriQuery = []
    , uriFragment = Nothing }
  ```

  In this library we use quite a few refined text values. They only can be
  constructed by using smart constructors like `mkScheme :: MonadThrow m =>
  Text -> m (RText 'Scheme)`. For example, if argument to `mkScheme` is not a
  valid scheme, an exception will be thrown. Actually this is not necessarily
  so because there are pure monads that are instances of the `MonadThrow` type
  class, and so the smart constructors may be used in e.g. the `Maybe` monad
  as well.

  There is a smart constructor that can make an entire `URI` too, it's called
  (unsurprisingly) `mkURI`:

  ```haskell
  λ> uri <- URI.mkURI "https://markkarpov.com"
  λ> uri
  URI
    { uriScheme = Just "https"
    , uriAuthority = Right
        (Authority
          { authUserInfo = Nothing
          , authHost = "markkarpov.com"
          , authPort = Nothing })
    , uriPath = Nothing
    , uriQuery = []
    , uriFragment = Nothing }
  ```

  If argument of `mkURI` is not a valid URI, then an exception will be thrown.
  The exception will contain full context and the actual parse error.

  If some refined text value or `URI` is known statically at compile time, we
  can use Template Haskell, namely the “quasi quotes” feature. To do so import
  the `Text.URI.QQ` module and enable the `QuasiQuotes` language extension,
  like so:

  ```haskell
  λ> :set -XQuasiQuotes
  λ> import qualified Text.URI.QQ as QQ
  λ> let uri = [QQ.uri|https://markkarpov.com|]
  λ> uri
  URI
    { uriScheme = Just "https"
    , uriAuthority = Right
        (Authority
          { authUserInfo = Nothing
          , authHost = "markkarpov.com"
          , authPort = Nothing })
    , uriPath = Nothing
    , uriQuery = []
    , uriFragment = Nothing }
  ```

  Note how the value returned by the `url` quasi quote is pure, its
  construction cannot fail because when there is an invalid URI inside the
  quote it's a compilation error.

  The `Text.URI.QQ` module has quasi quoters for scheme, host, and other
  things, check it out.

  Finally the package provides two Megaparsec parsers: `parser` and
  `parserBs`. The first works on strict `Text`, while other one works on
  strict `ByteString`s. You can use the parsers in a bigger Megaparsec parser
  to parse `URI`s. To get started with Megaparsec, see [its Hackage
  page](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec).

  ### Inspection and manipulation

  Although one could use record syntax directly, possibly with language
  extensions like `RecordWildcards`, the best way to inspect and edit parts of
  `URI` is with lenses. The lenses can be found in the `Text.URI.Lens` module.
  If you have never used the
  [`lens`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) library, you could
  probably start by reading/watching materials suggested in the library
  description on Hackage.

  Here are some examples, just to show off what you can do:

  ```haskell
  λ> import Text.URI.Lens
  λ> uri <- URI.mkURI "https://example.com/some/path?foo=bar&baz=quux&foo=foo"
  λ> uri ^. uriScheme
  Just "https"
  λ> uri ^? uriAuthority . _Right . authHost
  Just "example.com"
  λ> uri ^. isPathAbsolute
  True
  λ> uri ^. uriPath
  ["some","path"]
  λ> k <- URI.mkQueryKey "foo"
  λ> uri ^.. uriQuery . queryParam k
  ["bar","foo"]
  -- etc.
  ```

  ### Rendering

  Rendering turns a `URI` into a sequence of bytes or characters. Currently
  the following options are available:

  * `render` for rendering to strict `Text`.
  * `render'` for rendering to text `Builder`. It's possible to turn that into
    lazy `Text` by using the `toLazyText` function from
    `Data.Text.Lazy.Builder`.
  * `renderBs` for rendering to strict `ByteString`.
  * `renderBs'` for rendering to byte string `Builder`. Similarly it's
    possible to get a lazy `ByteString` from that by using the
    `toLazyByteString` function from `Data.ByteString.Builder`.
  * `renderStr` can be used to render to `String`. Sometimes it's handy. The
    render uses difference lists internally so it's not that slow, but in
    general I'd advise avoiding `String`s.
  * `renderStr'` returns `ShowS`, which is just a synonym for `String ->
    String`—a function that prepends the result of rendering to a given
    `String`. This is useful when the `URI` you want to render is a part of a
    bigger output, just like with the builders mentioned above.

  Examples:

  ```haskell
  λ> uri <- mkURI "https://markkarpov.com/posts.html"
  λ> render uri
  "https://markkarpov.com/posts.html"
  λ> renderBs uri
  "https://markkarpov.com/posts.html"
  λ> renderStr uri
  "https://markkarpov.com/posts.html"
  -- etc.
  ```
