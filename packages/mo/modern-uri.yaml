synopsis: Modern library for working with URIs
changelog: ! "## Modern URI 0.3.0.0\n\n* Uses Megaparsec 7. Visible API changes amount
  to an adjustment in\n  definition of the `ParseException` type.\n\n## Modern URI
  0.2.2.0\n\n* Removed a potentially overlapping instance `Arbitrary (NonEmpty (RText\n
  \ 'PathPiece))`.\n\n* Fixed a bug that made it impossible to have empty host names.
  This allows\n  us to parse URIs like `file:///etc/hosts`.\n\n## Modern URI 0.2.1.0\n\n*
  Added `emptyURI`—`URI` value representing the empty URI.\n\n## Modern URI 0.2.0.0\n\n*
  Changed the type of `uriPath` field of the `URI` record from `[RText\n  'PathPiece]`
  to `Maybe (Bool, NonEmpty (RText 'PathPiece))`. This allows\n  us to store whether
  there is a trailing slash in the path or not. See the\n  updated documentation for
  more information.\n\n* Added the `relativeTo` function.\n\n* Added the `uriTrailingSlash`
  0-1 traversal in `Text.URI.Lens`.\n\n## Modern URI 0.1.2.1\n\n* Allow Megaparsec
  6.4.0.\n\n## Modern URI 0.1.2.0\n\n* Fixed handling of `+` in query strings. Now
  `+` is parsed as space and\n  serialized as `%2b` as per RFC 1866 (paragraph 8.2.1).
  White space in\n  query parameters is serialized as `+`.\n\n## Modern URI 0.1.1.1\n\n*
  Fixed implementation of `Text.URI.Lens.queryParam` traversal.\n\n## Modern URI 0.1.1.0\n\n*
  Derived `NFData` for `ParseException`.\n\n* Adjusted percent-encoding in renders
  so it's only used when absolutely\n  necessary. Previously we percent-escaped a
  bit too much, which, strictly\n  speaking, did not make the renders incorrect, but
  that didn't look nice\n  either.\n\n## Modern URI 0.1.0.1\n\n* Updated the readme
  to include “Quick start” instructions and some\n  examples.\n\n## Modern URI 0.1.0.0\n\n*
  Changed the type of `uriAuthority` from `Maybe Authority` to `Either Bool\n  Authority`.
  This allows to know if URI path is absolute or not without\n  duplication of information,
  i.e. when the `Authority` component is present\n  the path is necessarily absolute,
  otherwise the `Bool` value tells if it's\n  absolute (`True`) or relative (`False`).\n\n*
  Added `isPathAbsolute` in `Text.URI` and the corresponding getter in\n  `Text.URI.Lens`.\n\n##
  Modern URI 0.0.2.0\n\n* Added the `renderStr` and `renderStr'` functions for efficient
  rendering\n  to `String` and `ShowS`.\n\n* Added the `parserBs` that can consume
  strict `ByteString` streams.\n\n## Modern URI 0.0.1.0\n\n* Initial release.\n"

  Status](https://travis-ci.org/mrkkrp/modern-uri.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mrkkrp/modern-uri)\n\nThis
  is a modern library for working with URIs in Haskell as per RFC 3986:\n\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986\n\n##
  Features\n\nThe `modern-uri` package features:\n\n* Correct by construction `URI`
  data type. Correctness is ensured by\n  guaranteeing that every sub-component of
  the `URI` record is by itself\n  cannot be invalid. This boils down to careful use
  of types and a set of\n  smart constructors for things like scheme, host, etc.\n*
  Textual components in the `URI` data type represented as `Text` rather\n  than `ByteString`,
  because they are percent-decoded and so they can\n  contain characters outside of
  ASCII range (i.e. Unicode). This allows for\n  easier manipulation of `URI`s, while
  encoding and decoding headaches are\n  handled by the parsers and renders for you.\n*
  Absolute and relative URIs differ only by the scheme component: if it's\n  `Nothing`,
  then URI is relative, otherwise it's absolute.\n* Megaparsec parser that can be
  used as a standalone smart constructor for\n  the `URI` data type (see `mkURI`)
  as well as be seamlessly integrated into\n  a bigger Megaparsec parser that consumes
  strict `Text` (see `parser`) or\n  strict `ByteString` (see `parserBs`).\n* The
  parser performs some normalization, for example it collapses\n  consecutive slashes.
  Some smart constructors such as `mkScheme` and\n  `mkHost` also perform normalization.
  So in a sense URIs are also\n  “normalized by construction” to some extent.\n* Fast
  rendering to strict `Text` and `ByteString` as well as to their\n  respective `Builder`
  types and to `String`/`ShowS`.\n* Extensive set of lensy helpers for easier manipulation
  of the nested data\n  types (see `Text.URI.Lens`).\n* Quasi-quoters for compile-time
  construction of the `URI` data type and\n  refined text types (see `Text.URI.QQ`).\n\n##
  Quick start\n\nThe `modern-uri` package serves three main purposes:\n\n* Construction
  of the `URI` data type.\n* Inspection and manipulation of the `URI` data type (in
  the sense of\n  changing its parts).\n* Rendering of `URI`s.\n\nLet's walk through
  every operation quickly.\n\n### Construction of `URI`s\n\nThere are four ways to
  create a `URI` value. First off, one could assemble\nit manually like so:\n\n```haskell\nλ>
  :set -XOverloadedStrings\nλ> import qualified Text.URI as URI\nλ> scheme <- URI.mkScheme
  \"https\"\nλ> scheme\n\"https\"\nλ> host <- URI.mkHost \"markkarpov.com\"\nλ> host\n\"markkarpov.com\"\nλ>
  let uri = URI.URI (Just scheme) (Right (URI.Authority Nothing host Nothing)) Nothing
  [] Nothing\nλ> uri\nURI\n  { uriScheme = Just \"https\"\n  , uriAuthority = Right\n
  \     (Authority\n        { authUserInfo = Nothing\n        , authHost = \"markkarpov.com\"\n
  \       , authPort = Nothing })\n  , uriPath = Nothing\n  , uriQuery = []\n  , uriFragment
  = Nothing }\n```\n\nIn this library we use quite a few refined text values. They
  only can be\nconstructed by using smart constructors like `mkScheme :: MonadThrow
  m =>\nText -> m (RText 'Scheme)`. For example, if argument to `mkScheme` is not
  a\nvalid scheme, an exception will be thrown. Actually this is not necessarily\nso
  because there are pure monads that are instances of the `MonadThrow` type\nclass,
  and so the smart constructors may be used in e.g. the `Maybe` monad\nas well.\n\nThere
  is a smart constructor that can make an entire `URI` too, it's called\n(unsurprisingly)
  `mkURI`:\n\n```haskell\nλ> uri <- URI.mkURI \"https://markkarpov.com\"\nλ> uri\nURI\n
  \ { uriScheme = Just \"https\"\n  , uriAuthority = Right\n      (Authority\n        {
  authUserInfo = Nothing\n        , authHost = \"markkarpov.com\"\n        , authPort
  = Nothing })\n  , uriPath = Nothing\n  , uriQuery = []\n  , uriFragment = Nothing
  }\n```\n\nIf argument of `mkURI` is not a valid URI, then an exception will be thrown.\nThe
  exception will contain full context and the actual parse error.\n\nIf some refined
  text value or `URI` is known statically at compile time, we\ncan use Template Haskell,
  namely the “quasi quotes” feature. To do so import\nthe `Text.URI.QQ` module and
  enable the `QuasiQuotes` language extension,\nlike so:\n\n```haskell\nλ> :set -XQuasiQuotes\nλ>
  import qualified Text.URI.QQ as QQ\nλ> let uri = [QQ.uri|https://markkarpov.com|]\nλ>
  uri\nURI\n  { uriScheme = Just \"https\"\n  , uriAuthority = Right\n      (Authority\n
  \       { authUserInfo = Nothing\n        , authHost = \"markkarpov.com\"\n        ,
  authPort = Nothing })\n  , uriPath = Nothing\n  , uriQuery = []\n  , uriFragment
  = Nothing }\n```\n\nNote how the value returned by the `url` quasi quote is pure,
  its\nconstruction cannot fail because when there is an invalid URI inside the\nquote
  it's a compilation error.\n\nThe `Text.URI.QQ` module has quasi quoters for scheme,
  host, and other\nthings, check it out.\n\nFinally the package provides two Megaparsec
  parsers: `parser` and\n`parserBs`. The first works on strict `Text`, while other
  one works on\nstrict `ByteString`s. You can use the parsers in a bigger Megaparsec
  parser\nto parse `URI`s. To get started with Megaparsec, see [its Hackage\npage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec).\n\n###
  Inspection and manipulation\n\nAlthough one could use record syntax directly, possibly
  with language\nextensions like `RecordWildcards`, the best way to inspect and edit
  parts of\n`URI` is with lenses. The lenses can be found in the `Text.URI.Lens` module.\nIf
  you have never used the\n[`lens`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) library,
  you could\nprobably start by reading/watching materials suggested in the library\ndescription
  on Hackage.\n\nHere are some examples, just to show off what you can do:\n\n```haskell\nλ>
  import Text.URI.Lens\nλ> uri <- URI.mkURI \"https://example.com/some/path?foo=bar&baz=quux&foo=foo\"\nλ>
  uri ^. uriScheme\nJust \"https\"\nλ> uri ^? uriAuthority . _Right . authHost\nJust
  \"example.com\"\nλ> uri ^. isPathAbsolute\nTrue\nλ> uri ^. uriPath\n[\"some\",\"path\"]\nλ>
  k <- URI.mkQueryKey \"foo\"\nλ> uri ^.. uriQuery . queryParam k\n[\"bar\",\"foo\"]\n--
  etc.\n```\n\n### Rendering\n\nRendering turns a `URI` into a sequence of bytes or
  characters. Currently\nthe following options are available:\n\n* `render` for rendering
  to strict `Text`.\n* `render'` for rendering to text `Builder`. It's possible to
  turn that into\n  lazy `Text` by using the `toLazyText` function from\n  `Data.Text.Lazy.Builder`.\n*
  `renderBs` for rendering to strict `ByteString`.\n* `renderBs'` for rendering to
  byte string `Builder`. Similarly it's\n  possible to get a lazy `ByteString` from
  that by using the\n  `toLazyByteString` function from `Data.ByteString.Builder`.\n*
  `renderStr` can be used to render to `String`. Sometimes it's handy. The\n  render
  uses difference lists internally so it's not that slow, but in\n  general I'd advise
  avoiding `String`s.\n* `renderStr'` returns `ShowS`, which is just a synonym for
  `String ->\n  String`—a function that prepends the result of rendering to a given\n
  \ `String`. This is useful when the `URI` you want to render is a part of a\n  bigger
  output, just like with the builders mentioned above.\n\nExamples:\n\n```haskell\nλ>
  uri <- mkURI \"https://markkarpov.com/posts.html\"\nλ> render uri\n\"https://markkarpov.com/posts.html\"\nλ>
  renderBs uri\n\"https://markkarpov.com/posts.html\"\nλ> renderStr uri\n\"https://markkarpov.com/posts.html\"\n--
  etc.\n```\n\n## Contribution\n\nIssues, bugs, and questions may be reported in [the
