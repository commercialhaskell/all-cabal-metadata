description: |-
  The "modsplit" program takes a (most likely auto-generated) single-module
  Haskell source file containing specifically formatted comments and
  splits it into several modules according to the directives
  contained in the special comments.

  This program has its roots in HSFFIG, and the format of these
  comments is described here:

  <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/HSFFIG/Tutorial#Splitting_large_modules>

  This program is intended to post-process the output of programs generating
  Haskell code rather than to deal with handwritten code.

  Special comment values are exported by this package in order to simplify
  writing of programs that use the splitter. See the documentation for
  the "Data.SplitBounds" module.
