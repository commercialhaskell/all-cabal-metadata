  This package allows you to invoke a function on one monadic
  type passing it an argument of a different monadic type.  The
  canonical example is using a function such as @'finally'@ or
  @'bracket'@ to ensure cleanup is run regardless of any
  exceptions thrown by a computation such as @x ::  'ReaderT'
  MyConfig 'IO' b@.  If @x@ uses the 'ReaderT' function 'ask',
  it cannot be re-written to run in the 'IO' monad, and hence
  cannot be executed with a construction like @'lift' (x
  ``finally`` cleanup)@.  Instead, you must use the 'wrap'
  method, provided by module "Control.Monad.Wrap" in this
  package.

  This package contains several other modules:
  "Control.Monad.WrapIO" wraps an IO action through multiple
  monad transformers.  "Control.Monad.WrapBase" generalizes the
  concept to other base monads besides IO.
  "Control.Monad.MultiWrap" implements 'mwrap', a method that
  behaves like 'wrap' but allows wrapping through multiple
  nested layers of monad transformer.  The module
  "Control.Monad.MultiLift" provides 'mlift', a version of
  'lift' that similarly lifts through multiple nested monad
  transformers.

  Since this library was first released, an alternate approach
  was introduced by the @monad-control@ package.
  @monad-control@ is now the standard.  However, this package,
  @monad-wrap@, stands as an example of accomplishing similar
  goals with fewer language extensions and less complexity.  In
  particular, @monad-wrap@ does not use @RankNTypes@ or
  @TypeFamilies@, both required by @monad-control@.  Moreover,
  @monad-wrap@ is much smaller--no 'MonadWrap' method requires
  more than one line of code.  Both @monad-wrap@ and
  @monad-control@ require @UndecidableInstances@, but
  "Control.Monad.Wrap" itself does not require that extension,
  only the other modules.
