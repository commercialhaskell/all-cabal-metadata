  # [module-munging][]

  [![Build badge][]][build]
  [![Version badge][]][version]

  ## Synopsis

  Thin (threadbare), low-tech means of smashing together raw text to create
  Haskell modules. This can be useful for code generation, preprocessors, etc.

  ## Goals

  `module-munging` exists primarily to ease building preprocessors. Preprocessors
  require smashing together text to make modules, and it gets tiresome quickly
  dealing again and again with things like imports, exports, etc. Additionally,
  many preprocessors are simple enough that pulling in something like
  `haskell-src-exts` is very much overkill. `module-munging` aims to provide as
  thin of a wrapper as possible over smashing together text while making the act
  of doing so a bit more pleasant.
