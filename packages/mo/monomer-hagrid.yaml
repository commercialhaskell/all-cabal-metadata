synopsis: A datagrid widget for the Monomer library.
changelog: "## 0.2.1.1\n### Changed\n- No longer build examples by default, since
  library users probably will not want them. \n\n## 0.2.1.0\n### Changed\n- Require
  the latest monomer (1.5.1.0), to get the fix for https://github.com/fjvallarino/monomer/issues/225\n###
  Fixed\n- Always expand into all available space, even with no items in the grid,
  for consistency.\n\n## 0.2.0.1\n### Fixed\n- Fix a bug where the grid did not update
  when the model went from empty to non-empty.\n\n## 0.2.0.0\n### Added\n- Speed up
  large grids by only creating widgets that are visible.\n- Use `Seq` rather than
  lists, for better performance with large grids (breaks API).\n- New \"resizing-cells\"
  example to show what happens when cells resize.\n### Fixed\n- The footer now only
  takes up vertical space if there are some footer widgets defined.\n\n## 0.1.0.0\n\nInitial
  release."

  # Monomer-Hagrid

  A datagrid widget for the [Monomer](https://github.com/fjvallarino/monomer) library.

  ![Example hagrid widget screenshot](readme/example.png)

  ## Current Status
  - Somewhat buggy and incomplete. Don't build your business on this.

  ## Current Features
  - Vertical and horizontal scrolling.
  - Resizable columns.
  - Column sorting, with a customizable sort key.
  - Configurable column alignment (left or right).
  - Custom widgets for each cell, to override the standard label.
  - Custom width/height padding for each cell, configured per column.
  - Scrolling to a particular row when sent a message.
  - Custom footer widgets on the bottom of each column.
  - Efficient implementation that only inflates visible widgets, scaling to at least 10000 rows.

  ## Definite Future Goals
  - Better documention.
  - Better tests.
  - Prettier appearance.

  ## Possible Future Goals
  - Explore providing an API where current sort/column widths/etc are stored in the parent model and updated by hagrid via a lens. This may remove some complexity around merging and the specification of initial sorts/column widths.

  ## API Documentation

  See the generated docs on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/monomer-hagrid).

  ## To build and run examples
  ```bash
  stack build --flag monomer-hagrid:examples
  `stack path --local-install-root`/bin/example-basic          # Demo of the basic functionality.
  `stack path --local-install-root`/bin/example-big-grid       # Demo of a grid with over 10000 rows.
  `stack path --local-install-root`/bin/example-resizing-cells # Demo where the cells are constantly changing size.
  ```

  ## Contribution Guide
  - This is "free as in mattress" software!
  - You are welcome to open an issue with bug reports or feature requests, but you may not get a response.
  - Unsolicited pull requests will likely be ignored.

  ### To format the source code

  ```bash
  # This needs at least ormolu 0.5.0.0 to avoid breaking dot-record syntax
  ormolu --mode inplace $(find . -name '*.hs')
  ```
