changelog: |-
  ## 0.2.0.0
  ### Added
  - Speed up large grids by only creating widgets that are visible.
  - Use `Seq` rather than lists, for better performance with large grids (breaks API).
  - New "resizing-cells" example to show what happens when cells resize.
  ### Fixed
  - The footer now only takes up vertical space if there are some footer widgets defined.

  ## 0.1.0.0

  Initial release.

  # Monomer-Hagrid

  A datagrid widget for the [Monomer](https://github.com/fjvallarino/monomer) library.

  ![Example hagrid widget screenshot](readme/example.png)

  ## Current Status
  - Somewhat buggy and incomplete. Don't build your business on this.

  ## Current Features
  - Vertical and horizontal scrolling.
  - Resizable columns.
  - Column sorting, with a customizable sort key.
  - Configurable column alignment (left or right).
  - Custom widgets for each cell, to override the standard label.
  - Custom width/height padding for each cell, configured per column.
  - Scrolling to a particular row when sent a message.
  - Custom footer widgets on the bottom of each column.
  - Efficient implementation that only inflates visible widgets, scaling to at least 10000 rows.

  ## Definite Future Goals
  - Better documention.
  - Better tests.
  - Prettier appearance.

  ## Possible Future Goals
  - Explore providing an API where current sort/column widths/etc are stored in the parent model and updated by hagrid via a lens. This may remove some complexity around merging and the specification of initial sorts/column widths.

  ## API Documentation

  See the generated docs on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/monomer-hagrid).

  ## To build and run examples
  ```bash
  stack run example-basic             # Demo of the basic functionality.
  stack run example-big-grid          # Demo of a grid with over 10000 rows.
  stack run example-resizing-cells    # Demo where the cells are constantly changing size.
  ```

  ## Contribution Guide
  - This is "free as in mattress" software!
  - You are welcome to open an issue with bug reports or feature requests, but you may not get a response.
  - Unsolicited pull requests will likely be ignored.

  ### To format the source code

  ```bash
  # This needs at least ormolu 0.5.0.0 to avoid breaking dot-record syntax
  ormolu --mode inplace $(find . -name '*.hs')
  ```
