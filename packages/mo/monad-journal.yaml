changelog: ! "# CHANGELOG\n\n### 0.8.1\n\n- Removed the `either` dependency. It was
  not needed anymore!\n\n## 0.8.0\n\n- Added support for either-4.5. This support
  breaks compatibility as we don’t have `EitherT`\n  anymore. If you used it, please
  fall back to `ExceptT`, which has the same interface.\n\n### 0.7.1\n\n- Added support
  for either 4.4.1.\n\n### 0.7\n\n- Added support for GHC 7.10.\n\n### 0.6.0.2\n\n-
  Fixed compilation error. That was due to the change regarding\nmonad-control-1.0.\n\n###
  0.6.0.1\n\n- Fixed bug about monad-control and type / data families.\n\n### 0.6\n\n-
  monad-control 1.0.0.1 qualified.\n\n### 0.5\n\n- license is now BSD3!;\n- enhanced
  the documentation in all modules;\n- added README.md.\n\n### 0.4.0.2\n\n- added
  the changelog in the package description (.cabal).\n\n### 0.4.0.1\n\n- added the
  *source-repository head* field in the .cabal file;\n- added the *bug-reports* field
  in the .cabal file;\n- change *author* and *maintainer* format.\n\n### 0.4\n\n-
  actually, lower bound is better for now; using mtl-2.1.\n\n### 0.3\n\n- now using
  lower-bound mtl’s version 0.2.2.1 for Control.Monad.Except.\n\n### 0.2.4\n\n- added
  `MonadExcept` instances.\n"

  ## Pure logger typeclass and monad transformer


  ### What is `monad-journal`?


  `monad-journal` is a simple but powerful answer to the logging problem. A lot

  of people think that “logging” is `IO`-related, while it’s not. Everyone must

  know [MonadWriter](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/mtl/latest/doc/html/Control-Monad-Writer-Class.html#t:MonadWriter)

  , which is perfect to log things in pure computations. The issue is that you

  can’t access those “things” inside the computation itself. `monad-journal`

  exposes a cool typeclass called `MonadJournal` that enables you to do so.
