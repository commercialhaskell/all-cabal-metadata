  ## tl;dr

  This library simplifies using [ekg](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ekg)
  in three ways:

  * It allows specifying metrics as constructors of a user-defined GADT
    carrying both the metric name (to avoid typos) and the metric kind
    (a counter, a distribution and so on â€” to avoid code duplication).
    Multiple GADTs in the same appplication are supported (hence
    "extensible").
  * It encapsulates managing all the necessary EKG objects on-demand via
    a monadic API.
  * It allows defining new kinds of metrics in the user code
    (hence "extensible" one more time).
    You want a combined distribution + counter? No prob!

  `System.Metrics.Extensible` is your entry point of choice!

  ## A quick example

  First we enable a few extensions and import some packages:
  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds, GADTs, StandaloneDeriving #-}

  import System.Metrics.Extensible
  import System.Remote.Monitoring -- for ekg stuff
  ```

  Then we define a type that represents the possible metrics in our
  application:
  ```haskell
  data SomeMetrics ty name where
    SomeCounter     :: SomeMetrics Counter "some_counter"
    AnotherCounter  :: SomeMetrics Counter "other_counter"
    SomeGauge       :: SomeMetrics Gauge   "some_gauge"
  ```
  The string literals are what will be shown via ekg UI.

  There is a couple of requirements:

  * The type shall be of the kind `* -> Symbol -> *`.
  * The first type argument (`Counter` and `Gauge` in the example above)
    shall be an instance of `TrackerLike`. All ekg counters are already
    instances of this class.
  * The type shall be comparable, hence we also do
    ```haskell
    deriving instance Eq (SomeMetrics ty name)
    deriving instance Ord (SomeMetrics ty name)
    ```

  Then we can write our small program!

  ```haskell
  main :: IO ()
  main = do
    ekgServer <- forkServer "localhost" 8000
    withMetricsStore ekgServer $ \store -> flip runMetricsT store $ do
      track SomeCounter
      track SomeGauge 42
  ```

  * `withMetricsStore` creates the metrics store that's managed by this
    library and runs an `IO` computation with that store.
  * `runMetricsT` is what runs the monad transformer giving access to
    the metrics.
  * `track` is the function that's responsible for updating the metrics.
    Its arguments depend on the specific metric that's being tracked:
    for instance, as can be seen in the example above,
    `Counter`s have no arguments, while `Gauge`s accept
    the corresponding new value.
