  # Morley: Developer tools for the Michelson Language

  Morley is a library to make writing smart contracts in Michelson pleasant and
  effective.

  ## I: A reimplementation of the Michelson Language in Haskell

  It consists of the following parts:

  - `Tezos.*` hierarchy is designed to implement cryptographic primitives, string and byte formats, and any other functionality specific to the Tezos protocol which is required for testing/execution of Michelson contracts, but is used not only by Michelson.
  - `Michelson.Untyped` and `Michelson.Typed` hierarchies define Haskell data types that assemble a Michelson contract. See [michelsonTypes.md](/docs/michelsonTypes.md).
  - `Michelson.TypeCheck`: A typechecker that validates Michelson contracts according to Michelson's typing rules. Essentially it performs conversion from untyped representation to the typed one. See [morleyTypechecker.md](/docs/morleyTypechecker.md).
  - `Michelson.Intepreter`: An intepreter for Michelson contracts which doesn't perform any side effects. See [morleyInterpreter.md](/docs/morleyInterpreter.md).
  - `Morley.Types`: Types for macros, syntactic sugar and other extensions described in the next chapter.
  - `Morley.Parser` A parser to turn a `.tz` or `.mtz` file (`.mtz` is a Michelson contract with Morley extensions) into a Haskell ADT.
  - `Morley.Runtime`: A high-level interface to Morley functionality, see [morleyRuntime.md](/docs/morleyRuntime.md).

  ## II: Morley extensions

  The Morley Language is a superset of the Michelson language, which means that each Michelson contract is also a valid Morley contract but not vice versa.
  There are several extensions which make it more convenient to write Michelson contracts and test them.
  See [the document](/docs/morleyLanguage.md) about these extensions.
  Also there is a transpiler from Morley to Michelson.

  ## III: Morley-to-Michelson transpiler

  Morley-to-Michelson transpiler can be used to produce a Michelson contract from Morley contract.
  You should use it if you want to develop contracts in Morley and submit them to Tezos network.
  Workflow is the following:

  1. If your contract is called `foo.mtz`, use `morley print --contract foo.mtz > foo.tz`. Note that normally you should not use `morley` directly, you should use `morley.sh` or `stack exec -- morley`. See usage instructions below.
  2. After that you can use existing Tezos tools to deploy your contract. You can also typecheck or interpreter it using reference implementation. If you are not familiar with Tezos tooling, please read [Tezos documentation](http://tezos.gitlab.io/zeronet/index.html) or [Michelson tutoriral](https://gitlab.com/camlcase-dev/michelson-tutorial).

  ## IV: Testing EDSL

  Coming soon, see TM-77.

  ## Running and building

  Morley executable provides following functionality:
  - `parse` contract and return its representation in haskell types.
  - `typecheck` contract.
  - `run` contract. Given contract is being originated first and then transaction is being sent to it
  - `originate` contract.
  - `transfer` tokens to given address.
  - `print` produce `.tz` contract that can be parsed by the OCaml referenced client from `.mtz` or `.tz` contract.

  You can get more info about this command by running `morley <command> --help`

  There are two ways to get morley executable:
  - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) based (preferable). Get [script](/scripts/morley.sh)
   (e. g. using `curl https://gitlab.com/camlcase-dev/morley/raw/master/scripts/morley.sh > morley.sh`)
    and run it `./morley.sh <args>`. This script will pull docker image that contains latest version of morley executable from master branch and run it with given arguments.
    Usage example:
    `./morley.sh` to see help message
    `./morley.sh run --contract add1.tz --storage 1 --parameter 1 --amount 1`
  - [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) based. Clone this git repository and run `stack build` command,
    after that you can do `stack exec -- morley <args>` to run morley executable built from source code.
    Usage example:
    `stack exec -- morley --help` to see help message
    `stack exec -- morley originate --contract contracts/add1.tz --storage 1 --verbose`

  - [typechecker doc](/docs/morleyTypechecker.md)
