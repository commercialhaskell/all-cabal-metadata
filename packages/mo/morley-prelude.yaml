  0.6.0
  =====
  * [!1364](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1364)
    Update to LTS-21.4 (GHC 9.4.5)

  0.5.3
  =====
  * [!1352](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1352)
    Clean-up Buildable ExecutorOp implementation
    + New convenience combinators, for `Buildable`: `quoteF` and `quoteF'`
  * [!1360](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1360)
    Add generic-deriving default Buildable implementation
    + We already had `GenericBuildable` which could be used with `DerivingVia`,
      this just adds an option to use `Buildable` with `DeriveAnyClass` for the
      same effect, which is a bit more DRY.
  * [!1351](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1351)
    Fix and improve `Buildable MichelsonFailureWithStack`
    + Slightly tweak reflowing braces (`++|`, `|++`) for smarter line breaks
    + Add a couple more useful formatters, `flatAltF` and its particularly useful
      specialization, `quoteOrIndentF`
  * [!1346](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1346)
    Use proper datatype for Micheline primitives, refactor some FromExp instances
    + Add `toEnumSafe`, a total version of `toEnum` for `Bounded` types
    + Add `punctuateF` formatter to `Fmt`
  * [!1348](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1348)
    Make `length` polymorphic in its return value
  * [!1342](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1342)
    Implement `prettyprinter`-compatible replacement for `fmt`
    + New modules, `Fmt`, `Fmt.Buildable`, `Fmt.Operators`, `Fmt.Utils` (the
      latter three are reexported by the former)
    + `Fmt.Buildable` implements `fmt`-like API on top of `prettyprinter`
    + `Fmt.Operators` implements Wadler-Leijen operators missing from
      `prettyprinter`. Additionally, these operators have smart `mempty` handling
    + `Fmt.Utils` has some handy type synonyms and helper functions
    + **Important**: `Buildable` operates on `Doc` instead of `Builder`; having a
      synonym would be more confusing than helpful, so there isn't one; update
      your code accordingly

  0.5.2
  =====
  * [!1290](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1290)
    Add `or`, `and`, `or1`, `and1`, `not` functions for overloaded booleans
    + Add `BooleanMonoid` type class for boolean-like things that can define
      `true` and `false`.

  0.5.1
  =====
  * [!1080](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1080)
    Add more `PrettyShow` type instances
    + For lists
    + Add instances that forbid defining `PrettyShow` for `String`, `Text`, and `ByteString`
  * [!1075](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1075)
    Add suitable types for oddly-sized unsigned integers
    + Add a dependency on `OddWord`.
    + Re-export `Word62`, `Word63` types representing unsigned integer word types with odd sizes in `Prelude`.
  * [!1025](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1025)
    Reduce the number of unsafe functions at the call site
    + Add `unsafe`, which is primarily needed for making unsafe counter-parts of safe functions, to `Unsafe`.
    + Add `unsafeM`, which is similar to `unsafe`, but throws monadic exceptions.
  * [!978](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/978)
    Make it difficult to misuse 'Show'
    + `show` exported from `morley-prelude` now requires the type to be an instance of an open type family `PrettyShow` of kind `Constraint`. This is intended to discourage the use of `show` for user-facing output (use `Buildable` instead).
    + The original `show` is exported from `Debug` module, which is intended to be imported qualified.
  * [!1035](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1035)
    Better type errors on invalid int casts

  0.5.0
  =====
  * [!1001](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1001)
    Make fromIntegralNoOverflow safe(r)
    + `fromIntegralNoOverflow` now doesn't throw `ArithException` `Underflow`
    + Moved `fromIntegralNoOverflow` from `Unsafe` to `Prelude`
  * [!936](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/936)
    + Hide `Universum`'s `fromIntegral` and redefine it as `intCast` in `Prelude`.
    + Re-export `intCastMaybe` as `fromIntegralMaybe` in `Prelude`.
    + Add `fromIntegralToRealFrac` to `Prelude`.
    + Add `fromIntegralOverflowing` to `Prelude`.
    + Add `fromIntegralNoOverflow` to `Unsafe`.
    + Add `Unsafe.fromIntegral` which is like `Universum`'s `fromIntegral` but raises exception on overflow/underflow.
  * [!945](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/945)
    + Bump Stackage LTS version from 17.9 to 18.10.

  0.4.2
  =====
  * [!867](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/867)
    + Hid Prelude's `&&` and `||` operators
    + Exported `Boolean` typeclass and polymorphic `&&` and `||` operators.

  0.4.1
  =====
  * [!861](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/861)
    + Removed the re-export of some basic `microlens` operators from `universum`
      in favor of the ones from `lens` with the same name.
  * [!779](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/779)
    + Export `for`.

  0.4.0
  =====

  * [!814](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/814)
    + Reverted hiding `Type` from export list.
  * [!781](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/781)
    + Replaced mixins and dependency on `base` with `base-noprelude`.

  * Change the license to MIT.

  0.3.0
  =====

  * Hide `Nat` export.

  0.2.0.1
  =======

  * Update maintainer.

  0.2.0
  ======

  * Hide `readFile` and `writeFile`.
  * Add `Unsafe` module which re-exports `Universum.Unsafe`.

  0.1.0.4
  =====

  Initial release.
  Re-exports `universum`.
