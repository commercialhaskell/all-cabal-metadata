description: |-
  A monad @m@ is said to allow scheduling if you can pass a number of actions @m a@ to it,
  and those can be executed at the same time concurrently.
  You can observe the result of the actions after some time:
  Some actions will complete first, and the results of these are returned then as a list @'NonEmpty' a@.
  Other actions are still running, and for these you will receive continuations of type @m a@,
  which you can further run or schedule to completion as you like.
