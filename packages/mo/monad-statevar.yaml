description: |-
  Overloaded 'get' and 'put' for state variables ('IORef', 'STRef', 'TVar')
  to make reading and writing more concise.

  Inspired by the StateVar package by Sven Panne, with the following
  differences:

  * Supports variables in other monads besides 'IO' (e.g. 'TVar', 'STRef').

  * Provides non-infix 'put', 'modify', etc.

  * Does not provide concrete state variables (i.e. ones where you supply
  get and put callbacks).  If you want this feature, please submit an
  issue.

  * Named \"Control.Monad.StateVar\" instead of \"Data.StateVar\",
  to avoid a module naming conflict.
