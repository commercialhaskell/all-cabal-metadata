synopsis: A collection of monad transformers.
changelog: |
  Version 3.0
    * Add instane from `MonadFail`---none of the transformers implement this
      functionality so the implementation just lifts things.

  Version 3.8
    * Added `WithBase`

  Version 3.3.0

  * Remove 'RunStateM'
    Simplifies the library without loosing functionality.
    It seems that we can get the same behavior by just using 'get' and 'set'.

  * Add functions that use a monad morphism to "derive" implementations
    of most of the funcitons in the library.

  Files
  ~~~~~

  LICENSE             The license for the library.
  README              This file.
  Setup.hs            Used by the Cabal framework.
  monadLib.cabal      Used by the Cabal framework.

  src/MonadLib.hs        The library.
  src/MonadLib/Derive.hs Definitions useful for monads defined with newtype.
  src/MonadLib/Monads.hs Definitions for some more base monads (optional).


  Simple Installation
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  To use 'monadLib' you should place the file 'MonadLib.hs'
  (and perhaps also 'Monads.hs') in a place where your
  implementation can find it.


  Cabal Installation
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The library supports the Cabal framework which has many options.
  To see the available commands try:
  > runhaskell Setup.hs --help

  A typical installation might look something like this:
  > runhaskell Setup.hs configure
  > runhaskell Setup.hs build
  > runhaskell Setup.hs haddock -- if you have haddock, else skip
  > runhaskell Setup.hs install
