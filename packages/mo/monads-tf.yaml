  Monad classes using type families, with instances for various monad transformers,
  inspired by the paper
  [Functional Programming with Overloading and Higher-Order Polymorphism][paper],
  by Mark P Jones, in *Advanced School of Functional Programming*, 1995.

  This package is almost a compatible replacement for the `mtl-tf` package.
