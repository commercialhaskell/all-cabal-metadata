changelog: "2.4\r\n---\r\n* Initial Hackage/Cabal release.\r\n  Version set to 2.4
  to distinguish from the 2.3 (non-cabal) release on my home page.\r\n\r\n3.0\r\n---\r\n*
  Included MasterTable.txt in the distro.\r\n* Eq and Ord Instances now based on strict
  structural equality (derived)\r\n* Exposed height related functions\r\n\r\n3.1\r\n---\r\n*
  Exposed BinPath primitives.\r\n* Removed AVL tree based sorts.\r\n* Removed Data.Map/Set
  conversions. This eliminates the containers package dependency.\r\n* Removed link
  to Haskell wiki homepage as this will never be done.\r\n* Removed link to maintainer
  email.\r\n\r\n3.2\r\n---\r\nNo code changes, just reclaiming ownership and bumping
  version No.\r\n\r\n4.0\r\n---\r\n* Changed to derived Read/Show instances (instead
  of via lists).\r\n  Hence the instances are incompatible with earlier versions.\r\n*
  Added:\r\n   genDisjointUnion,testGenDisjointUnion\r\n   genVenn,testGenVenn\r\n
  \  genVennMaybe,testGenVennMaybe\r\n   genVennToList,\r\n   genVennAsList\r\n   genVennMaybeToList\r\n
  \  genVennMaybeAsList\r\n* Added UBT6 cpp macro to ghcdefs/h98defs\r\n\r\n4.1\r\n---\r\n*
  Added missing strictness to genVenn,genVennMaybe\r\n\r\n4.2\r\n---\r\n* A lot of
  function renaming (old names still available but deprecated).\r\n* Gather all deprecations
  in 1 new module: Data.Tree.AVL.Deprecated\r\n* Added findEmptyPath,nub,nubBy\r\n\r\n"

description: |-
  A comprehensive and efficient implementation of AVL trees. The raw AVL
  API has been designed with efficiency and generality in mind, not elagance or
  safety. It contains all the stuff you really don't want to write yourself if you
  can avoid it. This library may be useful for rolling your own Sets, Maps, Sequences,
  Queues (for example).
