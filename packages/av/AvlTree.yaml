changelog: "# 4.3\r\n\r\n* Remove previously deprecated functions.\r\n* Class `Typeable1`
  is no longer a thing.\r\n\r\n# 4.2\r\n\r\n* A lot of function renaming (old names
  still available but deprecated).\r\n* Gather all deprecations in 1 new module: `Data.Tree.AVL.Deprecated`.\r\n*
  Added `findEmptyPath`, `nub`, `nubBy`.\r\n\r\n# 4.1\r\n\r\n* Added missing strictness
  to `genVenn`, `genVennMaybe`.\r\n\r\n# 4.0\r\n\r\n* Changed to derived `Read` /
  `Show` instances (instead of via lists).\r\n  Hence the instances are incompatible
  with earlier versions.\r\n* Added:\r\n  * `genDisjointUnion`,`testGenDisjointUnion`,\r\n
  \ * `genVenn`,`testGenVenn`,\r\n  * `genVennMaybe`,`testGenVennMaybe`,\r\n  * `genVennToList`,\r\n
  \ * `genVennAsList`,\r\n  * `genVennMaybeToList`,\r\n  * `genVennMaybeAsList`.\r\n*
  Added `UBT6` cpp macro to `ghcdefs.h` / `h98defs.h`.\r\n\r\n# 3.2\r\n\r\n* No code
  changes, just reclaiming ownership and bumping version No.\r\n\r\n# 3.1\r\n\r\n*
  Exposed `BinPath` primitives.\r\n* Removed AVL tree based sorts.\r\n* Removed `Data.Map`
  / `Data.Set` conversions. This eliminates the `containers` package dependency.\r\n*
  Removed link to Haskell wiki homepage as this will never be done.\r\n* Removed link
  to maintainer email.\r\n\r\n# 3.0\r\n\r\n* Included `MasterTable.txt` in the distro.\r\n*
  `Eq` and `Ord` Instances now based on strict structural equality (derived).\r\n*
  Exposed height-related functions.\r\n\r\n# 2.4\r\n\r\n* Initial Hackage/Cabal release.\r\n
  \ Version set to 2.4 to distinguish from the 2.3 (non-cabal) release on my home
  page.\r\n"

description: |-
  A comprehensive and efficient implementation of AVL trees. The raw AVL
  API has been designed with efficiency and generality in mind, not elagance or
  safety. It contains all the stuff you really don't want to write yourself if you
  can avoid it. This library may be useful for rolling your own Sets, Maps, Sequences,
  Queues (for example).
