description: |-
  This library provides a priority queue data structure that is meant to be used primarily as a control
  structure, in the vein of list and Logic. The PriorityQueue data structure in question is an instance of
  Applicative, Alternative, and Monad classes much like the standard list data type. In addition, it also
  tracks the cost incurred by each computation it stores, and provides operations for pruning overly
  expansive branches.
