description: "# LambdaSound\n\nA Haskell libary for generating low-level sounds with
  high-level combinators.\n\nYou can create sounds as a list of floats and then manipulate
  them with \ncombinators like `parallel`, `sequentially` or `dropSound`.\n\n## Examples\n\n```haskell\n--
  An infinite 440hz sinus curve\nsound440Hz :: Sound I Pulse\nsound440Hz = sineWave
  440 \n\n-- Three infinite sounds in parallel\ntriad :: Sound I Pulse\ntriad = parallel
  $ fmap (asNote sineWave) [c4, e4, g4]\n\n-- Five sequential 1 second sounds \nascending
  :: Sound T Pulse\nascending = sequentially $\n  fmap (setDuration 1 . asNote sineWave)
  [c4,d4,e4,f4,g4]\n\n-- Cut apart sounds with takeSound and dropSound\nascendingPart
  :: Sound T Pulse\nascendingPart = takeSound 1 $ dropSound 1 ascending\n\n-- Add
  a quiet noise to a sound\nnoisyAscending :: Sound T Pulse\nnoisyAscending = parallel\n
  \ [ setDuration (getDuration ascending) (reduce 3 (noise 42)),\n    ascending\n
  \ ]\n\n-- Raise the frequency of a sound so it has a higher pitch\nascendingAnOctaveHigher
  :: Sound T Pulse\nascendingAnOctaveHigher = raise 8 ascending \n\n-- Reverse the
  samples in a sound\ndescending :: Sound T Pulse\ndescending = reverseSound ascending\n\n--
  Change the tempo the parts of a sound are played at\nspeedupDuringSound :: Sound
  d Pulse -> Sound d Pulse\nspeedupDuringSound = changeTempo $ \\progress -> progress
  ** 1.2\n\n-- Play sound with a sample rate of 44100\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n
  \ let volume = 0.5\n      sampleRate = 44100\n  play sampleRate volume ascending\n```\n\nYou
  can also take a look at `example/Example1.hs` and `example/Example2.hs` for bigger
  examples and play them with:\n\n```haskell\ncabal run example1\ncabal run example2\n```\n\n##
  Feature Overview\n\n- Play sounds with SDL2\n- Save sounds as WAV\n- Create raw
  audio samples by defining a vector of floats\n- Manipulate the duration of a sound\n-
  Combine sounds via `parallel`, `sequentially` or `zipSound`\n- Change volume\n-
  Modify the pitch\n- Create a sound and then map over its samples\n- Convolve sounds\n-
  IIR filters\n- Cut apart sounds with `takeSound` and `dropSound`\n- Scaling playing
  speed\n- Cache expensive to compute sounds in your XDG-cache directory\n- Loading
  wav files (with some caveats)\n- Embed IO into sounds\n\n## Building\n\n`lambdasound`
  can be built as usual with the `cabal` package manager. \n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/Simre1/lambdasound\ncabal
  build lambdasound\n```\n\nYou can run the example with:\n\n```haskell\ncabal run
  example1\ncabal run example2\n```\n\nFor this library, you will need to have **SDL2**
  installed. Take a look at [proteeaudio-sdl](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/proteaaudio-sdl)
  for installation instructions.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nFeel free to try out this
  library and add additional functionality."
