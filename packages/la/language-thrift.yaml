  0.12.0.1 (2021-12-04)
  =====================

  - Allow semigroups 0.20

  0.12.0.0 (2020-12-31)
  =====================

  -   Port to Megaparsec 9.

  0.11.0.0 (2019-10-01)
  =====================

  -   Port to Megaparsec 7.

  0.10.0.0 (2016-09-25)
  =====================

  -   Breaking: Consolidate struct, union, and exception AST types into a single
      data type: `Struct`. Whether the object is a struct, union, or exception is
      now determined by the `StructKind` attribute.
  -   Breaking: Deprecated module `Language.Thrift.Types` has now been removed.

  0.9.0.2 (2016-08-31)
  ====================

  -   Disallow reserved keywords from being used as identifier names.

  0.9.0.1 (2016-05-26)
  ====================

  -   Build with GHC 8.

  0.9.0.0 (2016-05-15)
  ====================

  - Deprecate the `Language.Thrift.Types` in favor of `Language.Thrift.AST`.
  - Upgrade to `megaparsec` 5.0.

  0.8.0.2 (2016-08-31)
  ====================

  -   Disallow reserved keywords from being used as identifier names.

  0.8.0.1 (2016-05-24)
  ====================

  -   Build with GHC 8.

  0.8.0.0 (2016-02-09)
  ====================

  This release contains breaking changes. The number of transitive dependencies
  has been reduced significantly.

  -   Switched parser to `megaparsec`. `trifecta` and `parsers` bring too many
      dependencies with them.
  -   Drop support for `wl-pprint`. Only `ansi-wl-pprint` is supported now.
  -   Drop dependency on `lens`. Lenses for fields of the AST elements are still
      provided but prisms are not. Use `Control.Lens.makePrisms` to derive your
      own if needed.

  0.7.0.1 (2016-01-27)
  ====================

  -   Drop use of `TemplateHaskell`.

  0.7.0.0 (2016-01-15)
  ====================

  -   Added source annotations to all `TypeReference` and
      `ConstValue` constructors.
  -   Added `name` and `srcAnnot` lenses for `Type` and `Definition`.

  0.6.2.0 (2016-01-05)
  ====================

  -   Use more concrete types for lenses which don't need overloading.

  0.6.1.0 (2016-01-03)
  ====================

  -   Output generated by the `ansi-wl-pprint` pretty printer will be colored
      using ANSI escape codes.

  0.6.0.1 (2016-01-02)
  ====================

  -   Export `Pretty` instances from `Language.Thrift.Types` instead of requiring
      a separate import of the corresponding `Pretty` module.

  0.6.0.0 (2016-01-02)
  ====================

  -   Added a pretty printer based on `ansi-wl-pprint`.
  -   Both pretty printing modules now export instances of `Pretty` for relevant
      elements of the AST. These instances use `defaultConfig` for printing.

  0.5.0.0 (2015-12-27)
  ====================

  The AST representation has been overhauled to be more consistent and
  accessible. As a result, this release contains a number of breaking changes:

  -   Moved `Header` records into `Include` and `Namespace` types.
  -   Moved `ConstDefinition` record into separate type, `Const`.
  -   Moved `ServiceDefinition` record into separate type, `Service`.
  -   Moved `Type` records into separate types: `Typedef`, `Enum`, `Struct`,
      `Union`, `Exception`, `Senum`.
  -   Renamed `FieldType` to `TypeReference`.
  -   Renamed parser and pretty printer for `TypeReference` to `typeReference`.
  -   Renamed the following record fields: `constType` to `constValueType`,
      `typedefType` to `typedefTargetType`, `fieldType` to `fieldValueType`, and
      `fieldDefault` to `fieldDefaultValue`.
  -   Hide `function` parser and pretty printer.
  -   Moved type annotations for defined types into the records for the
      types themselves.

  Other changes:

  -   Added lenses and prisms for AST types where appropriate.
  -   Parsing will fail if the end of the document is not reached when the
      parser stops. This fixes the bug where the parser would stop half way
      through a file when it saw a recoverable error.
  -   Added source annotations to headers, type references (`DefinedType`) and
      constant value references (`ConstIdentifer`).
  -   Added `i8` as an alias for `byte`.
  -   Type annotations are now allowed to have no associated value.
  -   Expose parsers and pretty printers for different headers and definitions.
  -   Fixed a bug which would cause parsing to fail if a definition ended with a
      semicolon or a comma.
  -   Drop dependency on mtl.

  0.4.0.0 (2015-08-02)
  ====================

  -   Add pretty printing module.
  -   Parsers of different constructors are no longer exported by the parsing
      module; instead only the parsers for their corresponding types
      are exported.
  -   Rename record for field requiredness from `fieldRequiredNess` to
      `fieldRequiredness`.

  0.3.0.0 (2015-07-31)
  ====================

  -   Allow changing the underlying parser to any parser that implements the
      `TokenParsing` class from `parsers`.
  -   Add `thriftIDLParser` for standard use cases.
  -   Add `Language.Thrift.Parser.Trifecta` with a standard
      Trifecta-based parser.

  0.2.0.0 (2015-06-12)
  ====================

  -   Track starting positions in source annotations.
  -   Move docs to a separate field.

  0.1.0.1 (2015-06-02)
  ====================

  -   Allow `base` 4.9.

  0.1.0.0 (2015-04-05)
  ====================

  -   Initial release.

  [![build-status]](https://travis-ci.org/abhinav/language-thrift)

  `language-thrift` provides a parser and pretty printer for the [Thrift IDL
  format]. In addition to parsing the IDL, it keeps track of Javadoc-style
  comments (`/** ... */`) and attaches them to the type, service, function, or
  field, above which they were added. These are retained when the document is
  sent through the pretty printer.

  The parser uses [`megaparsec`] and the pretty printer [`ansi-wl-pprint`]. The
  pretty printer can produce syntax highlighted output.

  Haddock-generated docs are available on [Hackage] and [here].
