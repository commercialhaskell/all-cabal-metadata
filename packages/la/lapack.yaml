  # Change log for the `lapack` package

  ## 0.3.1

   * `Matrix.Symmetric`:
     You can now import many functions for symmetric matrices from this module.
     This is more natural than importing them from `Triangular`.

  ## 0.3

   * Matrix data family

   * `Matrix`: `ZeroInt` -> `ShapeInt`, `zeroInt` -> `shapeInt`

   * `Hermitian`, `BandedHermitian`: `covariance` -> `gramian`

   * `Square.eigensystem`:
     Return left eigenvectors as rows of the last matrix.
     This is adjoint with respect to the definition in `lapack-0.2`
     but it is consistent
     with the other eigenvalue and singular value decompositions.

  ## Installation

  Before installing the Haskell bindings
  you need to install the BLAS and LAPACK packages.
  Please note, that additionally to the reference implementation in FORTRAN 77
  there are alternative optimized implementations
  like OpenBLAS, ATLAS, Intel MKL.

  ### Debian, Ubuntu

  ~~~~
  sudo apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev
  ~~~~

  ### MacOS

  You may install pkgconfig and LAPACK via MacPorts:

  ~~~~
  sudo port install pkgconfig lapack
  ~~~~

  However, the pkg-config files for LAPACK
  seem to be installed in a non-standard location.
  You must make them visible to pkg-config by

  ~~~~
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/local/lib/lapack/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
  ~~~~

  You may set the search PATH permanently by adding
  the above command line to your `$HOME/.profile` file.

  Alternatively, a solution for all users of your machine
  would be to set symbolic links:

  ~~~~
  sudo ln -s /opt/local/lib/lapack/pkgconfig/blas.pc /opt/local/lib/pkgconfig/blas.pc
  sudo ln -s /opt/local/lib/lapack/pkgconfig/lapack.pc /opt/local/lib/pkgconfig/lapack.pc
  ~~~~


  ## Introduction

  Here is a small example for constructing and formatting matrices:

  ~~~~
  Prelude> import qualified Numeric.LAPACK.Matrix as Matrix
  Prelude Matrix> import Numeric.LAPACK.Format as Fmt ((##))
  Prelude Matrix Fmt> let a = Matrix.fromList (Matrix.shapeInt 3) (Matrix.shapeInt 4) [(0::Float)..]
  Prelude Matrix Fmt> a ## "%.4f"
   0.0000 1.0000  2.0000  3.0000
   4.0000 5.0000  6.0000  7.0000
   8.0000 9.0000 10.0000 11.0000
  Prelude Matrix Fmt> import qualified Numeric.LAPACK.Matrix.Shape as MatrixShape
  Prelude Matrix Fmt MatrixShape> import qualified Numeric.LAPACK.Matrix.Triangular as Triangular
  Prelude Matrix Fmt MatrixShape Triangular> let u = Triangular.upperFromList MatrixShape.RowMajor (Matrix.shapeInt 4) [(0::Float)..]
  Prelude Matrix Fmt MatrixShape Triangular> (u, Triangular.transpose u) ## "%.4f"
   0.0000 1.0000 2.0000 3.0000
          4.0000 5.0000 6.0000
                 7.0000 8.0000
                        9.0000

   0.0000
   1.0000 4.0000
   2.0000 5.0000 7.0000
   3.0000 6.0000 8.0000 9.0000
  ~~~~

  ## Formatting

  We do not try to do fancy formatting for the `Show` instance.
  The `Show` instances of matrices emit plain valid Haskell code in one line
  where all numbers are printed in full precision.
  If matrices are part of larger Haskell data structures
  this kind of formatting works best.
  For human-friendly formatting in GHCi you need to add something like `## "%.4f"`
  after a matrix or vector expression.
  It means: Print all numbers in fixed point representation
  using four digits for the fractional part.
  You can use the formatting placeholders provided by `printf`.
  The matrices have `Hyper` instances for easy usage in
  [HyperHaskell](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hyper-haskell-server).

  Formatting is based on the `Output` type class
  that currently supports output as
  [Text boxes](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/boxes)
  for GHCi and
  [HTML](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/blaze-html)
  for HyperHaskell.


  ## Matrix vs. Vector

  Vectors are `Storable.Array`s from the
  [comfort-array](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/comfort-array) package.
  An array can have a fancy shape
  like a shape defined by an Haskell enumeration type,
  the shape of two appended arrays,
  a shape that is compatible to a Haskell container type,
  a rectangular or triangular shape.

  All operations check dynamically
  whether corresponding shapes match structurally.
  E.g. `a|||b === c|||d` composes a matrix from four quadrants `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`.
  It is not enough that `a|||b` and `c|||d` have the same width,
  but the widths of `a` and `c` as well as `b` and `d` must match.
  The type variables for shapes show which dimensions must be compatible.
  We recommend to use type variables for the shapes as long as possible
  because this increases type safety even
  if you eventually use only `ShapeInt`.
  If you use statically sized shapes you get static size checks.

  A matrix can have any of these shapes as height and as width.
  E.g. it is no problem to define a matrix
  that maps a triangular shaped array to a rectangular shaped one.
  There are actually practical applications to such matrices.
  A matrix can be treated as vector, but there are limitations.
  E.g. if you scale a Hermitian matrix by a complex factor
  it will in general be no longer Hermitian.
  Another problem: Two equally sized rectangular matrices
  may differ in the element order (row major vs. column major).
  You cannot simply add them by adding the flattened arrays element-wise.
  Thus if you want to perform vector operations on a matrix
  the package requires you to "unpack" a matrix to a vector
  using `Matrix.Array.toVector`.
  This conversion is almost a no-op and preserves most of the shape information.
  The reverse operation is `Matrix.Array.fromVector`.

  There are more matrix types that are not based on a single array.
  E.g. we provide a symbolic inverse, a scaling matrix, a permutation matrix.
  We also support arrays that represent factors of a matrix factorization.
  You obtain these by LU and QR decompositions.
  You can extract the matrix factors of it,
  but you can also multiply the factors to other matrices
  or use the decompositions for solving simultaneous linear equations.


  ## Type tags for content constraints

  Full matrices have additional type tags to distinguish
  between four cases of the size relations between
  the height and the width of a full matrix.
  In a matrix of type `Matrix.Full vert horiz height width a`
  the type variables mean:

  ~~~~
  vert  height
  Small Small - Square matrix   height==width
  Big   Small - Tall matrix     size height >= size width
  Small Big   - Wide matrix     size height <= size width
  Big   Big   - General matrix  height and width arbitrary
  ~~~~

  The relations are defined using two type tags
  in order to support matrix transposition flawlessly.
  Using `Small Small` for square matrices
  and `Big Big` for general matrices appears to be arbitrary,
  but is chosen such that altering `Small` to `Big`
  generalizes the size relation.

  Likewise we use the `Triangular` matrix type
  also to represent diagonal and symmetric matrices.
  For `Matrix.Triangular lo diag up size a` we have the cases:

  ~~~~
  lo    up
  Empty Empty - Diagonal matrix
  Empty Full  - Upper triangular matrix
  Full  Empty - Lower triangular matrix
  Full  Full  - Symmetric matrix
  ~~~~

  The `diag` type tag can be `NonUnit` or `Unit`.
  `Unit` can be used for matrices
  that always have a unit diagonal by construction.
  The property of a unit diagonal is preserved by some operations
  and enables some optimizations by LAPACK.
  `NonUnit` is a bit of a misnomer.
  A `NonUnit` matrix can still have a unit diagonal,
  but in general it has not and no optimizations will take place.


  ## Infix operators

  The package provides fancy infix operators like `#*|` and `\*#`.
  They symbolize both operands and operations.
  E.g. in `#*|` the hash means Matrix, the star means Multiplication
  and the bar means Column Vector.

  Possible operations are:

    * `a_*_b` - `a` multiplied by `b`

    * `a_/_b` - `a` multiplied by `inverse b`

    * `a_\_b` - `inverse a` multiplied by `b`

  Possible operands are:

    * `#` - a matrix that is generalized through a type class

    * `##` - a full matrix

    * `\` - a diagonal matrix represented by a `Vector`

    * `-` - a row vector

    * `|` - a column vector

    * `.` - a scalar

  For multiplication of equally shaped matrices
  we also provide instances of `Semigroup.<>`.

  Precedence of the operators is chosen analogously to plain `*` and `/`.
  Associativity is chosen such that the same operator can be applied
  multiple times without parentheses.
  But sometimes this may mean that you have to mix
  left and right associative operators,
  and thus you may still need parentheses.
