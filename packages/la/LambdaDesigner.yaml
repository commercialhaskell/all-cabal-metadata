description: "# Î»Designer\r\n\r\nA type-safe EDSL for TouchDesigner written in Haskell.
  Instead of connecting nodes by hand, use the power of algebraic data types to program
  TouchDesigner projects in Haskell.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n*
  TouchDesigner\r\n** With `dictdiffer` installed. You can `pip install dictdiffer`
  and then make sure TouchDesigner can see that module by following the [TouchDesigner
  tutorial](http://derivative.ca/wiki099/index.php?title=Introduction_to_Python_Tutorial#Importing_Modules)\r\n*
  Haskell (only tested with [haskellstack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/))\r\n\r\n###
  Installing\r\n\r\nClone or download [LambdaDesigner-sample](https://github.com/ulyssesp/lambdadesigner-sample).\r\n\r\n##
  Using\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n\r\nThis takes you through [`Main.hs`](https://github.com/ulyssesp/LambdaDesigner-sample/blob/master/app/Main.hs).
  Note that you must be running [`LambdaDesigner.toe`](https://github.com/ulyssesp/LambdaDesigner-sample/blob/master/TD/LambdaDesigner.toe)
  to see the results of running code.\r\n\r\nThe first thing you need to do is grab
  a reference to the runner.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntopRunner :: IO ( Tree TOP -> IO () )\r\n\r\nmain
  = do\r\n  r <- topRunner\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will let us run a `Tree TOP`
  which will show up as an output connector on the `lambda` COMP in TouchDesigner.
  Lets see this happening by creating a `movieFileIn` top with the sample image.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmain
  = do\r\n  r <- topRunner\r\n  r $ movieFileIn (bstr \"app.samplesFolder+'/Map/Banana.tif'\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe
  have something we can run!\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ stack build\r\n$ stack exec LamdaDesigner-sample-exe\r\n```\r\n\r\nTake
  a look at it running in TouchDesigner! To experiment with different node types check
  out the . Not every TouchDesigner node is represented yet, but the most common ones
  are there.\r\n\r\nIf you'd \r\n"
