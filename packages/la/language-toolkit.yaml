  # Changelog

  ## Version 1.2.0.1 — 2024-04-27
  ### Changed

    + inequalities supported in :isVarietyM/S/T for order
    + better error messages

  * bugfix: trimUnreachables handles epsilon-edges and avoids recomputation

  ## Version 1.1 — 2023-06-18
  ### Added
  * preliminary French translation of manual pages
  * basic Emacs mode for syntax highlighting
  * classification procedures
    + isAcom (aperiodic and commutative)
    + isLAcom (locally isAcom)
    + isFO2BF (two-variable FO with betweenness of factors)
    + isVariety (Plebby has one command each for *, +, and tier)
    + isMTF, isMTDef, isMTRDef, isMTGD (simple multitier classes)
  * Porters
    + egg-box diagrams
    + graphs of syntactic orders
  * Pleb syntax
    + empty variadics
    + reversal (`⇄`)
    + upward closures (`↑`, or `loopify` in the library)
    + shuffle products (`⧢` or `autShuffle` in the library)
    + symbol neutralization (`|syms|`, or `neutralize` in the library)
    + nonempty iteration (`+e` equivalent to `@(e,*e)`)
  * Plebby commands
    + `:cequal` and `:cimplies` to account for the semantics
    + `:eggbox` (display the egg-box)
    + `:synord` (display syntactic order)
  * Plebby configuration file
  ### Changed
  * bugfix: omega function works in properly regular semigroups

description: |-
  This provides the Language Toolkit (LTK) library
  and associated executables.
  There are four main components:

  * @factorize@,
  which takes as input a set of finite-state automata
  and writes out for each one a set of constraints
  that approximates (or, if possible, defines) it.

  * @plebby@,
  an interactive theorem-prover in which one can
  define languages via logical constraints
  or import finite-state automata
  and get information about the languages so defined.

  * @classify@,
  a command-line classification program useful
  for batch jobs.

  * And the @LTK@ library,
  which includes the functions used by
  @factorize@ and @plebby@
  as well as several other useful tools.

  This project began as a simple tool for working with
  finite-state automata, and has grown considerably more
  useful in working specifically with sub-regular languages
  as it has matured.
