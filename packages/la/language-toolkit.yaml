description: |-
  This provides the Language Toolkit (LTK) library
  and associated executables.
  There are four main components:

  * @factorize@,
  which takes as input a set of finite-state automata
  and writes out for each one a set of constraints
  that approximates (or, if possible, defines) it.

  * @plebby@,
  an interactive theorem-prover in which one can
  define languages via logical constraints
  or import finite-state automata
  and get information about the languages so defined.

  * @classify@,
  a command-line classification program useful
  for batch jobs.

  * And the @LTK@ library,
  which includes the functions used by
  @factorize@ and @plebby@
  as well as several other useful tools.

  This project began as a simple tool for working with
  finite-state automata, and has grown considerably more
  useful in working specifically with sub-regular languages
  as it has matured.
