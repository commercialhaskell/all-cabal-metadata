description: |-
  A library for turning values into text or markup. Flexibility
  is achieved by separating the semantics from the formatting
  implementation. This way, a function can output, for example,
  a table, which can then be rendered to any format.
  This library provides 'standard' objects that can be formatted,
  in module @Text.Layout.Objects@. It also provides data types for
  a few formats. These data types are glued together with
  instances of @Convertible@
