description: ! "LambdaHack\n==========\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LambdaHack/LambdaHack.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LambdaHack/LambdaHack)\n[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/LambdaHack.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/LambdaHack)\n[![Join
  the chat at https://gitter.im/LambdaHack/LambdaHack](https://badges.gitter.im/LambdaHack/LambdaHack.svg)](https://gitter.im/LambdaHack/LambdaHack?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\nLambdaHack
  is a Haskell[1] game engine library for ASCII roguelike[2]\ngames of arbitrary theme,
  size and complexity, with optional\ntactical squad combat. It's packaged together
  with a sample\ndungeon crawler in fantasy setting that can be tried out\nin the
  browser: http://lambdahack.github.io\n(It runs fastest on Chrome. Keyboard commands
  and savefiles\nare supported only on recent enough versions of browsers.\nMouse
  should work everywhere.)\n\nAs an example of the engine's capabilities, here is
  a showcase of shooting down explosive projectiles. A couple were shot down close
  enough to enemies to harm them. Others exploded closer to our party members and
  took out of the air the projectiles that would otherwise harm them.\n\n![gameplay
  screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdaHack/media/master/screenshot/allureofthestars.com.shooting.down.explosives.gif)\n\nThis
  was a semi-automatic stealthy speedrun of the escape scenario of the sample game
  that comes with the engine. Small fixed font. The enemy gang has a huge numerical
  and equipment superiority. Our team loots the area on auto-pilot until the first
  foe is spotted. Then they scout out enemy positions. Then hero 1 draws enemies and
  unfortunately enemy fire as well, which is when he valiantly shoots down explosives
  to avoid the worst damage. Then heroine 2 sneaks behind enemy lines to reach the
  remaining treasure. That accomplished, the captain signals retreat and leaves for
  the next area (the zoo).\n\n\nUsing the engine\n----------------\n\nTo use the engine,
  you need to specify the content to be\nprocedurally generated. You specify what
  the game world\nis made of (entities, their relations, physics and lore)\nand the
  engine builds the world and runs it.\nThe library lets you compile a ready-to-play
  game binary,\nusing either the supplied or a custom-made main loop.\nSeveral frontends
  are available (SDL2 is the default\nfor desktop and there is a JavaScript browser
  frontend)\nand many other generic engine components are easily overridden,\nbut
  the fundamental source of flexibility lies\nin the strict and type-safe separation
  of code from the content\nand of clients (human and AI-controlled) from the server.\n\nPlease
  see the changelog file for recent improvements\nand the issue tracker for short-term
  plans. Long term goals\ninclude multiplayer tactical squad combat, in-game content\ncreation,
  auto-balancing and persistent content modification\nbased on player behaviour. Contributions
  are welcome.\n\nOther games known to use the LambdaHack library:\n\n* Allure of
  the Stars[6], a near-future Sci-Fi game\n* Space Privateers[8], an adventure game
  set in far future\n\nNote: the engine and the example game are bundled together
  in a single\nHackage[3] package released under the permissive `BSD3` license.\nYou
  are welcome to create your own games by forking and modifying\nthe single package,
  but please consider eventually splitting your changes\ninto a separate content-only
  package that depends on the upstream\nengine library. This will help us exchange
  ideas and share improvements\nto the common codebase. Alternatively, you can already
  start the development\nin separation by cloning and rewriting Allure of the Stars[10]\nand
  mix and merge with the example LambdaHack game rules at will.\nNote that the LambdaHack
  sample game derives from the Hack/Nethack visual\nand narrative tradition[9], while
  Allure of the Stars uses the more free-form\nMoria/Angband style (it also uses the
  `AGPL` license, and `BSD3 + AGPL = AGPL`,\nso make sure you want to liberate your
  code and content to such an extent).\n\nWhen creating a new game based on LambdaHack
  I've found it useful to place\ncompletely new content at the end of the content
  files to distinguish from\nmerely modified original LambdaHack content and thus
  help merging with new\nreleases. Removals of LambdaHack content merge reasonably
  well, so there are\nno special considerations. When modifying individual content
  items,\nit makes sense to keep their Haskell identifier names and change only\nin-game
  names and possibly frequency group names.\n\n\nInstallation of the sample game from
  binary archives\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe game
  runs rather slowly in the browser (fastest on Chrome)\nand you are limited to only
  one font, though it's scalable.\nAlso, savefiles are prone to corruption on the
  browser,\ne.g., when it's closed while the game is still saving progress\n(which
  takes a long time). Hence, after trying out the game,\nyou may prefer to use a native
  binary for your architecture, if it exists.\n\nPre-compiled game binaries are available
  through\nthe release page[11] (and continuously from AppVeyor[18]).\nNote that Windows
  binaries no longer work on Windows XP, since Cygwin\nand MSYS2 dropped support for
  XP. To use a pre-compiled binary archive,\nunpack it and run the executable in the
  unpacked directory\nor use program shortcuts from the installer, if available.\n\nOn
  Linux, make sure you have the SDL2 libraries installed on your system\n(e.g., libsdl2-2.0-0,
  libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0 on Ubuntu; also libdw1).\nFor Windows, the SDL2 and all other
  needed libraries are already contained\nin the game's binary archive.\n\n\nScreen
  and keyboard configuration\n---------------------------------\n\nThe game UI can
  be configured via a config file.\nThe default settings, the same that are built
  into the binary,\nare in [GameDefinition/config.ui.default](https://github.com/LambdaHack/LambdaHack/blob/master/GameDefinition/config.ui.default).\nWhen
  the game is run for the first time, the file is copied to the default\nuser data
  folder, which is `~/.LambdaHack/` on Linux,\n`C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\LambdaHack\\`\n(or
  `C:\\Documents And Settings\\user\\Application Data\\LambdaHack\\`\nor something
  else altogether) on Windows, and in RMB menu, under\n`Inspect/Application/Local
  Storage` when run inside the Chrome browser.\n\nScreen font can be changed by editing
  the config file in the user\ndata folder. For a small game window, the highly optimized\n16x16x.fon
  and 8x8x.fon bitmap fonts are the best,\nbut for larger window sizes or if you require
  international characters\n(e.g. to give custom names to player characters), a modern
  scalable font\nsupplied with the game is the only option. The game window automatically\nscales
  according to the specified font size.\n\nIf you don't have a numeric keypad, you
  can use mouse or laptop keys\n(uk8o79jl) for movement or you can enable the Vi keys
  (aka roguelike keys)\nin the config file. If numeric keypad doesn't work, toggling\nthe
  Num Lock key sometimes helps. If running with the Shift key\nand keypad keys doesn't
  work, try Control key instead.\nThe game is fully playable with mouse only, as well
  as with keyboard only,\nbut the most efficient combination for some players is mouse
  for go-to,\ninspecting, and aiming at distant positions and keyboard for everything
  else.\n\nIf you are using a terminal frontend, numeric keypad may not work\ncorrectly
  depending on versions of the libraries, terminfo and terminal\nemulators. Toggling
  the Num Lock key may help.\nThe curses frontend is not fully supported due to the
  limitations\nof the curses library. With the vty frontend started in an xterm,\nControl-keypad
  keys for running seem to work OK, but on rxvt they do not.\nThe commands that require
  pressing Control and Shift together won't\nwork either, but fortunately they are
  not crucial to gameplay.\n\n\nCompilation of the library and sample game from source\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf
  you want to compile native binaries from the source code,\nuse Cabal (already a
  part of your OS distribution, or available within\nThe Haskell Platform[7]), which
  also takes care of all the dependencies.\n\nThe recommended frontend is based on
  SDL2, so you need the SDL2 libraries\nfor your OS. On Linux, remember to install
  the -dev versions as well,\ne.g., libsdl2-dev and libsdl2-ttf-dev on Ubuntu Linux
  16.04.\n(Compilation to JavaScript for the browser is more complicated\nand requires
  the ghcjs[15] compiler and optionally the Google Closure\nCompiler[16] as well.)\n\nThe
  latest official version of the LambdaHack library can be downloaded,\ncompiled for
  SDL2 and installed automatically by Cabal from Hackage[3]\nas follows\n\n    cabal
  update\n    cabal install LambdaHack\n\nFor a newer snapshot, download the source
  code from github[5]\nand run Cabal from the main directory\n\n    cabal install\n\nThere
  is a built-in black and white line terminal frontend, suitable\nfor teletype terminals
  or a keyboard and a printer (but it's going to use\na lot of paper, unless you disable
  animations with `--noAnim`). To compile\nwith one of the less rudimentary terminal
  frontends (in which case you are\non your own regarding font choice and color setup
  and you won't have\nthe spiffy colorful squares around special positions, only crude
  highlights),\nuse Cabal flags, e.g,\n\n    cabal install -fvty\n\n\nTesting and
  debugging\n---------------------\n\nThe [Makefile](https://github.com/LambdaHack/LambdaHack/blob/master/Makefile)\ncontains
  many sample test commands.\nNumerous tests that use the screensaver game modes (AI
  vs. AI)\nand the teletype frontend are gathered in `make test`.\nOf these, travis
  runs `test-travis` on each push to github.\nTest commands with prefix `frontend`
  start AI vs. AI games\nwith the standard, user-friendly frontend.\n\nRun `LambdaHack
  --help` to see a brief description of all debug options.\nOf these, the `--sniff`
  option is very useful (though verbose\nand initially cryptic), for displaying the
  traffic between clients\nand the server. Some options in the config file may prove
  useful too,\nthough they mostly overlap with commandline options (and will be totally\nmerged
  at some point).\n\nYou can use HPC with the game as follows (details vary according\nto
  HPC version).\n\n    cabal clean\n    cabal install --enable-coverage\n    make
  test\n    hpc report --hpcdir=dist/hpc/dyn/mix/LambdaHack --hpcdir=dist/hpc/dyn/mix/LambdaHack-xxx/
  LambdaHack\n    hpc markup --hpcdir=dist/hpc/dyn/mix/LambdaHack --hpcdir=dist/hpc/dyn/mix/LambdaHack-xxx/
  LambdaHack\n\nA quick manual playing session after the automated tests would be
  in order,\nas well, since the tests don't touch the topmost UI layer.\nNote that
  a debug option of the form `--stopAfter*` is required to cleanly\nterminate any
  automated test. This is needed to gather any HPC info,\nbecause HPC requires a clean
  exit to save data files.\n\n\nCoding style\n------------\n\nStylish Haskell is used
  for slight auto-formatting at buffer save; see\n[.stylish-haskell.yaml](https://github.com/LambdaHack/LambdaHack/blob/master/.stylish-haskell.yaml).\nAs
  defined in the file, indentation is 2 spaces wide and screen is\n80-columns wide.
  Spaces are used, not tabs. Spurious whitespace avoided.\nSpaces around arithmetic
  operators encouraged.\nGenerally, relax and try to stick to the style apparent in
  a file\nyou are editing. Put big formatting changes in separate commits.\n\nHaddocks
  are provided for all module headers and for all functions and types\nfrom major
  modules, in particular the modules that are interfaces\nfor a whole directory of
  modules. Apart of that, only very important\nfunctions and types are distinguished
  by having a haddock.\nIf minor ones have comments, they should not be haddocks\nand
  they are permitted to describe implementation details and be out of date.\nPrefer
  assertions to comments, unless too verbose.\n\n\nFurther information\n-------------------\n\nFor
