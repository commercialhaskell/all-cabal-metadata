  this is a minor release, primarily intended to fix the broken haddock documentation
  on Hackage\n- changes since 0.2.6 are mostly unrelated to gameplay:\n    - strictly
  typed config files split into UI and rules\n    - a switch from Text to String throughout
  the codebase\n    - use of the external library miniutter for English sentence generation\n\n##

description: ! "LambdaHack [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LambdaHack/LambdaHack.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LambdaHack/LambdaHack)[![Build
  Status](https://drone.io/github.com/LambdaHack/LambdaHack/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/LambdaHack/LambdaHack/latest)\n==========\n\nLambdaHack
  is a [Haskell] [1] game engine library for [roguelike] [2]\ngames of arbitrary theme,
  size and complexity. You specify the content\nto be procedurally generated, including
  game rules and AI behaviour.\nThe library lets you compile a ready-to-play game
  binary, using either\nthe supplied or a custom-made main loop. Several frontends
  are available\n(GTK is the default) and many other generic engine components\nare
  easily overridden, but the fundamental source of flexibility lies\nin the strict
  and type-safe separation of code and content and of clients\n(human and AI-controlled)
  and server. Long-term goals for LambdaHack include\nsupport for multiplayer tactical
  squad combat, in-game content creation,\nauto-balancing and persistent content modification
  based on player behaviour.\n\nThe engine comes with a sample code for a little dungeon
  crawler,\ncalled LambdaHack and described in [PLAYING.md](GameDefinition/PLAYING.md).\n\n![gameplay
  screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdaHack/media/master/screenshot/raid1.png)\n\nOther
  games known to use the LambdaHack library:\n\n* [Allure of the Stars] [6], a near-future
  Sci-Fi game\n* [Space Privateers] [8], an adventure game set in far future\n\nNote:
  the engine and the example game are bundled together in a single\n[Hackage] [3]
  package released under the permissive `BSD3` license.\nYou are welcome to create
  your own games by forking and modifying\nthe single package, but please consider
  eventually splitting your changes\ninto a separate content-only package that depends
  on the upstream\nengine library. This will help us exchange ideas and share improvements\nto
  the common codebase. Alternatively, you can already start the development\nin separation
  by cloning and rewriting [Allure of the Stars] [10]\nor any other pure game content
  package and mix and merge with the example\nLambdaHack game rules at will. Note
  that the LambdaHack sample game\nderives from the [Hack/Nethack visual and narrative
  tradition] [9],\nwhile Allure of the Stars uses the more free-form Moria/Angband
  style\n(it also uses the `AGPL` license, and `BSD3 + AGPL = AGPL`,\nso make sure
  you want to liberate your code and content to such an extent).\n\n\nInstallation
  from binary archives\n---------------------------------\n\nPre-compiled game binaries
  for some platforms are available through\nthe [release page] [11] and from the [Nix
  Packages Collection] [12].\nTo manually install a binary archive, make sure you
  have the GTK\nlibraries suite on your system, unpack the LambdaHack archive\nand
  run the executable in the unpacked directory.\n\nOn Windows, if you don't already
  have GTK installed (e.g., for the GIMP\npicture editor) please download and run
  (with default settings)\nthe GTK installer from\n\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/gtk-win/\n\n\nScreen
  and keyboard configuration\n---------------------------------\n\nThe game UI can
  be configured via a config file.\nA file with the default settings, the same as
  built into the binary, is in\n[GameDefinition/config.ui.default](GameDefinition/config.ui.default).\nWhen
  the game is run for the first time, the file is copied to the official\nlocation,
  which is `~/.LambdaHack/config.ui.ini` on Linux and\n`C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\LambdaHack\\config.ui.ini`\n(or
  `C:\\Documents And Settings\\user\\Application Data\\LambdaHack\\config.ui.ini`\nor
  something else altogether) on Windows.\n\nScreen font can be changed and enlarged
  by editing the config file\nat its official location or by CTRL-right-clicking on
  the game window.\n\nIf you use the numeric keypad, use the NumLock key on your keyboard\nto
  toggle the game keyboard mode. With NumLock off, you walk with the numeric\nkeys
  and run with SHIFT (or CONTROL) and the keys. This mode is probably\nthe best if
  you use mouse for running. When you turn NumLock on,\nthe reversed key setup enforces
  good playing habits by setting as the default\nthe run command (which automatically
  stops at threats, keeping you safe)\nand requiring SHIFT (or CONTROL) for the error-prone
  step by step walking.\n\nIf you don't have the numeric keypad, you can use laptop
  keys (uk8o79jl)\nor you can enable the Vi keys (aka roguelike keys) in the config
  file.\n\n\nCompilation from source\n-----------------------\n\nIf you want to compile
  your own binaries from the source code,\nuse Cabal (already a part of your OS distribution,
  or available within\n[The Haskell Platform] [7]), which also takes care of all the
  dependencies.\nYou also need the GTK libraries for your OS. On Linux, remember to
  install\nthe -dev versions as well. On Windows follow [the same steps as for Wine]
  [13].\nOn OSX, if you encounter problems, you may want to\n[compile the GTK libraries
  from sources] [14].\n\nThe latest official version of the library can be downloaded,\ncompiled
  and installed automatically by Cabal from [Hackage] [3] as follows\n\n    cabal
  update\n    cabal install gtk2hs-buildtools\n    cabal install LambdaHack --force-reinstalls\n\nFor
  a newer snapshot, download source from a development branch\nat [github] [5] and
  run Cabal from the main directory\n\n    cabal install gtk2hs-buildtools\n    cabal
  install --force-reinstalls\n\nFor the example game, the best frontend (wrt keyboard
  support and colours)\nis the default gtk. To compile with one of the terminal frontends,\nuse
  Cabal flags, e.g,\n\n    cabal install -fvty --force-reinstalls\n\n\nCompatibility
  notes\n-------------------\n\nIf you are using a terminal frontend, numeric keypad
  may not work\ncorrectly depending on versions of the libraries, terminfo and terminal\nemulators.
  The curses frontend is not fully supported due to the limitations\nof the curses
  library. With the vty frontend started in an xterm,\nCTRL-keypad keys for running
  seem to work OK, but on rxvt they do not.\nThe commands that require pressing CTRL
  and SHIFT together won't\nwork either, but fortunately they are not crucial to gameplay.\nFor
  movement, laptop (uk8o79jl) and Vi keys (hjklyubn, if enabled\nin config.ui.ini)
  should work everywhere. GTK works fine, too, both\nwith numeric keypad and with
  mouse.\n\n\nTesting and debugging\n---------------------\n\nThe [Makefile](Makefile)
  contains many sample test commands.\nNumerous tests that use the screensaver game
  modes (AI vs. AI)\nand the dumb `stdout` frontend are gathered in `make test`.\nOf
  these, travis runs `test-travis-*` on each push to the repo.\nTest commands with
  prefix `frontend` start AI vs. AI games\nwith the standard, user-friendly gtk frontend.\n\nRun
  `LambdaHack --help` to see a brief description of all debug options.\nOf these,
  `--sniffIn` and `--sniffOut` are very useful (though verbose\nand initially cryptic),
  for monitoring the traffic between clients\nand the server. Some options in the
  config file may prove useful too,\nthough they mostly overlap with commandline options
  (and will be totally\nmerged at some point).\n\nYou can use HPC with the game as
  follows (details vary according\nto HPC version). A quick manual playing session\nafter
  the automated tests would be in order, as well, since the tests don't\ntouch the
  topmost UI layer.\n\n    cabal clean\n    cabal install --enable-coverage\n    make
  test\n    hpc report --hpcdir=dist/hpc/dyn/mix/LambdaHack --hpcdir=dist/hpc/dyn/mix/LambdaHack-xxx/
  LambdaHack\n    hpc markup --hpcdir=dist/hpc/dyn/mix/LambdaHack --hpcdir=dist/hpc/dyn/mix/LambdaHack-xxx/
  LambdaHack\n\nNote that debug option `--stopAfter` is required to cleanly terminate\nany
  automated test. This is needed to gather any HPC info, because HPC\nrequires a clean
  exit to save data files.\n\n\nFurther information\n-------------------\n\nFor more
  information, visit the [wiki] [4]\nand see [PLAYING.md](GameDefinition/PLAYING.md),
