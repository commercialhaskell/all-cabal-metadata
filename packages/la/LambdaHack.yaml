  LambdaHack is a Haskell[1] game engine library for ASCII roguelike[2]
  games of arbitrary theme, size and complexity, with optional
  tactical squad combat. It's packaged together with a sample
  dungeon crawler in wierd fantasy setting that can be tried out
  in the browser at http://lambdahack.github.io.
  (It runs fastest on Chrome. Keyboard commands and savefiles
  are supported only on recent enough versions of browsers.
  Mouse should work everywhere.)

  As an example of the engine's capabilities, here is a showcase of shooting down explosive projectiles. A couple were shot down close enough to enemies to harm them. Others exploded closer to our party members and took out of the air the projectiles that would otherwise harm them.

  This was a semi-automatic stealthy speedrun of the escape scenario of the sample game that comes with the engine. Small bitmap font. The enemy gang has a huge numerical and equipment superiority. Our team loots the area on auto-pilot until the first foe is spotted. Then they scout out enemy positions. Then hero 1 draws enemies and unfortunately enemy fire as well, which is when he valiantly shoots down explosives to avoid the worst damage. Then heroine 2 sneaks behind enemy lines to reach the remaining treasure. That accomplished, the captain signals retreat and leaves for the next area (the zoo).


  Using the engine
  ----------------

  To use the engine, you need to specify the content to be
  procedurally generated. You specify what the game world
  is made of (entities, their relations, physics and lore)
  and the engine builds the world and runs it.
  The library lets you compile a ready-to-play game binary,
  using either the supplied or a custom-made main loop.
  Several frontends are available (SDL2 is the default
  for desktop and there is a JavaScript browser frontend)
  and many other generic engine components are easily overridden,
  but the fundamental source of flexibility lies
  in the strict and type-safe separation of code from the content
  and of clients (human and AI-controlled) from the server.

  Please see the changelog file for recent improvements
  and the issue tracker for short-term plans. Long term goals
  include multiplayer tactical squad combat, in-game content
  creation, auto-balancing and persistent content modification
  based on player behaviour. Contributions are welcome.
  Please offer feedback to mikolaj.konarski@funktory.com or, preferably,
  at any of the public forums.

  Other games known to use the LambdaHack library:

  * Allure of the Stars[6], a near-future Sci-Fi game
  * Space Privateers[8], an adventure game set in far future

  Note: the engine and the example game are bundled together in a single
  Hackage[3] package released under the permissive `BSD3` license.
  You are welcome to create your own games by forking and modifying
  the single package, but please consider eventually splitting your changes
  into a separate content-only package that depends on the upstream
  engine library. This will help us exchange ideas and share improvements
  to the common codebase. Alternatively, you can already start the development
  in separation by cloning and rewriting Allure of the Stars[10]
  and mix and merge with the example LambdaHack game rules at will.
  Note that the LambdaHack sample game derives from the Hack/Nethack visual
  and narrative tradition[9], while Allure of the Stars uses the more free-form
  Moria/Angband style (it also uses the `AGPL` license, and `BSD3 + AGPL = AGPL`,
  so make sure you want to liberate your code and content to such an extent).

  When creating a new game based on LambdaHack I've found it useful to place
  completely new content at the end of the content files to distinguish from
  merely modified original LambdaHack content and thus help merging with new
  releases. Removals of LambdaHack content merge reasonably well, so there are
  no special considerations. When modifying individual content items,
  it makes sense to keep their Haskell identifier names and change only
  in-game names and possibly frequency group names.


  Installation of the sample game from binary archives
  ----------------------------------------------------

  The game runs rather slowly in the browser (fastest on Chrome)
  and you are limited to only one font, though it's scalable.
  Also, savefiles are prone to corruption on the browser,
  e.g., when it's closed while the game is still saving progress
  (which takes a long time). Hence, after trying out the game,
  you may prefer to use a native binary for your architecture, if it exists.

  Pre-compiled game binaries are available through the release page[11]
  (and, for Windows, dev versions continuously from AppVeyor[18]).
  To use a pre-compiled binary archive, unpack it and run the executable
  in the unpacked directory or use program shortcuts from the installer,
  if available. On Linux, make sure you have the SDL2 libraries installed
  on your system (e.g., libsdl2-2.0-0 and libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0 on Ubuntu).
  For Windows (XP no longer supported), the SDL2 and all other needed libraries
  are already contained in the game's binary archive.


  Screen and keyboard configuration
  ---------------------------------

  The game UI can be configured via a config file.
  The default settings, the same that are built into the binary,
  are in [GameDefinition/config.ui.default](https://github.com/LambdaHack/LambdaHack/blob/master/GameDefinition/config.ui.default).
  When the game is run for the first time, the file is copied to the default
  user data folder, which is `~/.LambdaHack/` on Linux,
  `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\LambdaHack\`
  (or `C:\Documents And Settings\user\Application Data\LambdaHack\`
  or something else altogether) on Windows, and in RMB menu, under
  `Inspect/Application/Local Storage` when run inside the Chrome browser.

  Screen font and consequently window size can be changed by editing
  the config file in the user data folder. The default bitmap font
  `16x16xw.bdf` covers most national characters in the Latin alphabet
  (e.g. to give custom names to player characters) and results
  in a game window of exactly 720p (standard HD) dimensions. The `8x8xb.fnt`
  bitmap font results in a tiny window and covers latin-1 characters only.
  The scalable `16x16xw.woff` font results in window sizes dependent
  on the `scalableFontSize` parameter in the config file.
  With `scalableFontSize = 16` it should look almost the same
  as the pixel-perfect `16x16xw.bdf`.

  If you don't have a numeric keypad, you can use the Vi editor keys
  (aka roguelike keys) or mouse for movement or you can enable the compact
  laptop keys (uk8o79jl) in the config file. If numeric keypad doesn't work,
  toggling the Num Lock key sometimes helps. If running with the Shift key
  and keypad keys doesn't work, try Control key instead.
  The game is fully playable with mouse only, as well as with keyboard only,
  but the most efficient combination for some players is mouse for go-to,
  inspecting, and aiming at distant positions and keyboard for everything else.

  If you are using a terminal frontend, e.g. the best supported vty frontend,
  numeric keypad (e.g., keypad '*' and '/') may not work correctly
  depending on versions of the libraries, terminfo and terminal emulators.
  Toggling the Num Lock key may help or make issues worse. As a workaround
  for the vty frontend, numbers are used for movement, which sadly prevents
  the number keys from selecting heroes. The commands that require pressing
  Control and Shift together won't work either, but fortunately they are
  not crucial to gameplay.

  Some effort has been put to help using the vty frontend with screen readers,
  but without feedback it's hard to say how accesible that setup is.
  As a side effect of screen reader support, there is no aiming line
  nor path in vty frontend. Screen readers may also work better with animations
  turned off using `--noAnim` or the corresponding config file option.
  Note that unicode and cursor support are now necessary for correct output.


  Compilation of the library and sample game from source
  ------------------------------------------------------

  If you want to compile native binaries from the source code,
  use Cabal (already a part of your OS distribution, or available within
  The Haskell Platform[7]), which also takes care of all the dependencies.

  The recommended frontend is based on SDL2, so you need the SDL2 libraries
  for your OS. On Linux, remember to install the -dev versions as well,
  e.g., libsdl2-dev and libsdl2-ttf-dev on Ubuntu Linux 16.04.
  (Compilation to JavaScript for the browser is more complicated
  and requires the ghcjs[15] compiler and optionally the Google Closure
  Compiler[16] as well.)

  The latest official version of the LambdaHack library can be downloaded,
  compiled for SDL2 and installed automatically by Cabal from Hackage[3]
  as follows

      cabal update
      cabal install LambdaHack

  For a newer snapshot, clone the source code from github[5]
  and run Cabal from the main directory

      cabal install

  There is a built-in black and white line terminal frontend, suitable
  for teletype terminals or a keyboard and a printer (but it's going to use
  a lot of paper, unless you disable animations with `--noAnim`). To compile
  with one of the less rudimentary terminal frontends (in which case you are
  on your own regarding font choice and color setup and you won't have
  the spiffy colorful squares outlining special positions that exist in SDL2
  frontend, but only crude cursor highlights), use Cabal flags, e.g,

      cabal install -fvty


  Testing and debugging
  ---------------------

  The [Makefile](https://github.com/LambdaHack/LambdaHack/blob/master/Makefile)
  contains many sample test commands.
  Numerous tests that use the screensaver game modes (AI vs. AI)
  and the teletype frontend are gathered in `make test`.
  Of these, travis runs `test-travis` on each push to github.
  Test commands with prefix `frontend` start AI vs. AI games
  with the standard, user-friendly frontend.

  Run `LambdaHack --help` to see a brief description of all debug options.
  Of these, the `--sniff` option is very useful (though verbose
  and initially cryptic), for displaying the traffic between clients
  and the server. Some options in the config file may prove useful too,
  though they mostly overlap with commandline options (and will be totally
  merged at some point).

  You can use HPC with the game as follows (details vary according
  to HPC version).

      cabal clean
      cabal install --enable-coverage
      make test
      hpc report --hpcdir=dist/hpc/dyn/mix/LambdaHack --hpcdir=dist/hpc/dyn/mix/LambdaHack-xxx/ LambdaHack
      hpc markup --hpcdir=dist/hpc/dyn/mix/LambdaHack --hpcdir=dist/hpc/dyn/mix/LambdaHack-xxx/ LambdaHack

  A quick manual playing session after the automated tests would be in order,
  as well, since the tests don't touch the topmost UI layer.
  Note that a debug option of the form `--stopAfter*` is required to cleanly
  terminate any automated test. This is needed to gather any HPC info,
  because HPC requires a clean exit to save data files.


  Coding style
  ------------

  Stylish Haskell is used for slight auto-formatting at buffer save; see
  [.stylish-haskell.yaml](https://github.com/LambdaHack/LambdaHack/blob/master/.stylish-haskell.yaml).
  As defined in the file, indentation is 2 spaces wide and screen is
  80-columns wide. Spaces are used, not tabs. Spurious whitespace avoided.
  Spaces around arithmetic operators encouraged.
  Generally, relax and try to stick to the style apparent in a file
  you are editing. Put big formatting changes in separate commits.

  Haddocks are provided for all module headers and for all functions and types
  from major modules, in particular the modules that are interfaces
  for a whole directory of modules. Apart of that, only very important
  functions and types are distinguished by having a haddock.
  If minor ones have comments, they should not be haddocks
  and they are permitted to describe implementation details and be out of date.
  Prefer assertions to comments, unless too verbose.
