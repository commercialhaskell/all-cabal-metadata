  ## Overview

  `lasercutter` is a high-powered, high-speed, and high-tech tree parser for
  Haskell. It's somewhere between 500x and 1000x faster than `scalpel` on
  benchmarks and real workloads.

  Not only is it smokin' fast, `lasercutter` is a general tool for chopping up any
  sort of tree you've got --- not just HTML!

  Best of all, `lasercutter` rips through trees in a single pass. This is truly
  space-age stuff!


  ## Acknowledgments

  The core abstraction here is the brainchild of [Xia Li-yao][lyxia] --- huge
  shout-outs to him for turning my vague ideas into reality.
