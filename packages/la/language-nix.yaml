  # Revision History for language-nix

  ## 2.3.0

  * `Language.Nix.Identifier` now exports `nixKeywords` which lists
    keywords in Nix that are parseable as simple identifiers, but have
    special meaning, like `assert` and `with`. Consequently, they can't
    be used as (simple) identifiers in Nix code.

    `quote`, `needsQuoting` and `Pretty` will take this list into account
    and quote such identifiers. However, `HasParser` will _not_ reject them
    even if they are unquoted.
  * Resolved discrepancies between `Language.Nix.Identifier` and Nix w.r.t.
    quoting and escaping:

    - Fixed missing escaping of some Nix syntax elements, e.g. in the case of
     `ident # "${foo}"`.
    - Pretty printing `Identifier`s will no longer produce escape sequences
      Haskell supports, but Nix doesn't.
    - Parsing `Identifier`s won't interpret escape sequences that Nix wouldn't
      understand.
  * Added an hspec/QuickCheck based test suite.

  This Haskell library contains data types and useful functions to represent and manipulate the Nix language. It is used by tooling like cabal2nix and is not meant to be a general purpose nix parser or even interpreter. Have a look at [hnix (in Haskell)](https://github.com/haskell-nix/hnix) or [nix (the original in C++)](https://github.com/nixos/nix) instead.
