  # Change log

  All notable changes to the LaunchDarkly Haskell Server-side SDK will be documented in this file. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).

  ## [3.1.0] - 2023-01-27
  ### Added:
  - New `ApplicationInfo` type, for configuration of application metadata that may be used in LaunchDarkly analytics or other product features. This does not affect feature flag evaluations.

  ## [3.0.4] - 2023-01-09
  ### Changed:
  - Expanded upper version to allow `aeson-2.1`.  (Thanks, [vrom911](https://github.com/launchdarkly/haskell-server-sdk/pull/49))
  - Expanded upper version to allow `hashtables-1.3`. (Thanks, [vrom911](https://github.com/launchdarkly/haskell-server-sdk/pull/49))
  - Expanded upper version to allow `mtl-2.3`. (Thanks, [vrom911](https://github.com/launchdarkly/haskell-server-sdk/pull/49))
  - Expanded upper version to allow `text-2.0`. (Thanks, [vrom911](https://github.com/launchdarkly/haskell-server-sdk/pull/49))
  - Expanded upper version to allow `time-1.12`. (Thanks, [vrom911](https://github.com/launchdarkly/haskell-server-sdk/pull/49))

  ## [3.0.3] - 2022-11-08
  ### Added:
  - Commit generated Cabal file per the [stack recommendations](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/5210) (Thanks, [philderbeast](https://github.com/launchdarkly/haskell-server-sdk/pull/44))

  ### Changed:
  - Regenerated `.hlint.yaml` with defaults and counts (Thanks, [philderbeast](https://github.com/launchdarkly/haskell-server-sdk/pull/45)!)

  ### Fixed:
  - Fixed hlint "pattern parser error" lint. (Thanks, [philderbeast](https://github.com/launchdarkly/haskell-server-sdk/pull/46)!)

  ## [3.0.2] - 2022-09-20
  ### Changed:
  - Expanded upper version to allow lens 5.1. (Thanks, [bmillwood](https://github.com/launchdarkly/haskell-server-sdk/pull/42)!)

  ## [3.0.1] - 2022-07-01
  ### Fixed:
  - Fixed Aeson 2.0 compatibility layer.

  ## [3.0.0] - 2022-06-27
  ### Added:
  - Add flag support for the client side availability property, as well
  as the older the ability to decode from the older clientSide format.
  - The new allFlagsState function should be used instead of allFlags if you are passing flag data to the front end for use with the JavaScript SDK. It preserves some flag metadata that the front end requires in order to send analytics events correctly. Versions 2.5.0 and above of the JavaScript SDK are able to use this metadata, but the output of allFlagsState will still work with older versions.
  - It is now possible to inject feature flags into the client from local JSON files, replacing the normal LaunchDarkly connection. This would typically be for testing purposes. See LaunchDarkly.Server.Integrations.FileData.
  - LaunchDarkly.Server.Integrations.TestData is another new way to inject feature flag data programmatically into the SDK for testingâ€”either with fixed values for each flag, or with targets and/or rules that can return different values for different users. Unlike FileData, this mechanism does not use any external resources, only the data that your test code has provided.

  ### Changed:
  - CI builds now include a cross-platform test suite implemented in https://github.com/launchdarkly/sdk-test-harness. This covers many test cases that are also implemented in unit tests, but may be extended in the future to ensure consistent behavior across SDKs in other areas.
  - The SDK will track the last known server time as specified in the Date header when sending events. This value, along with the current system time, will be used to determine if debug event should still be sent.
  - VariationIndex has been changed from Natural to Integer.

  ### Fixed:
  - When evaluating against a user attribute, if the attribute is null, it should always be treated as a non-match.

  ## [2.2.0] - 2021-06-17
  ### Added:
  - The SDK now supports the ability to control the proportion of traffic allocation to an experiment. This works in conjunction with a new platform feature now available to early access customers.

  ## [2.1.1] - 2021-03-05
  ### Changed:
  - Updated dependency ranges. Thanks @dbaynard !

  ## [2.1.0] - 2021-02-04
  ### Added:
  - Added the `alias` function. This can be used to associate two user objects for analytics purposes by generating an alias event.

  ## [2.0.2] - 2020-10-13
  ### Fixed:
  - Removed unused legacy &#34;sel&#34; field from flag model.

  ## [2.0.1] - 2020-08-28
  ### Fixed:
  - Expanded dependency supported version range. Thanks @dbaynard!


  ## [2.0.0] - 2020-04-21
  ### Changed:
  - The function `userSetKey` is now takes `Text` instead of `Maybe Text` for the key. This originally existed for compatibility with an internal test suite.

  ### Removed:
  - The constructor `EvalErrorUserNotSpecified` has been removed from `EvalErrorKind`.

  ## [1.0.4] - 2020-04-06
  ### Fixed:
  - Widened time and lens dependency ranges. Thanks @nbouscal!

  ## [1.0.3] - 2020-03-31
  ### Fixed:
  - Standardize streaming retry behavior. Changed handling of status codes. Exponential back-off is now reset after 60 seconds of successful streaming.

  ## [1.0.2] - 2020-03-16
  ### Fixed:
  - Added a timeout on SSE reads to 5 minutes.
  - Fixed an issue where reading SSE streams would burn CPU in certain edge cases

  ## [1.0.1] - 2020-03-02
  ### Fixed:
  - Client initialization status is now correctly determined by checking the feature store instead of an always in memory value. This is particularly important for usage of daemon mode. In the current implementation daemon mode evaluation always returns the default fallback value because the client never becomes initialized.

  ## [1.0.0] - 2020-02-24
  ### Fixed:
  - Several haddock typos.
  - Added `configSetStoreTTL`, and `configSetUseLdd` to `LaunchDarkly.Server` export list.
  - Added `package.yaml` version constraints.

  ## [0.2.1] - 2020-02-21
  ### Fixed:
  - Added an event delivery retry mechanism. The SDK will now try to deliver events again after one second before dropping them.
  - Added a payload identity header for event delivery to prevent duplication in certain edge cases.
  - Made many fields strict for more deterministic memory usage.

  ## [0.2.0] - 2020-02-10
  ### Added:
  - Added support for utilizing external features stores. See `LaunchDarkly.Server.Store` for details on implementing a store. You can configure usage of a specific store with `configSetStoreBackend`.
  - Added support for Redis as an external feature store. See the `launchdarkly-server-sdk-redis` package for details.
  - Added support for LaunchDarkly daemon mode configurable with `configSetUseLdd`. To learn more, read [Using daemon mode](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/relay-proxy/using#using-daemon-mode).
  ### Fixed:
  - Incorrect ToJSON instances for flag rules and operators.
  - Updated bucketing logic to fallback to last variation instead of producing an error.
  - Refactored streaming implementation.
  - Stopped sending empty event payloads.


  ## [0.1.1] - 2019-12-10
  ### Fixed
  - Corrected internal HTTP client user agent format.

  # LaunchDarkly Server-side SDK for Haskell

  [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/haskell-server-sdk.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/haskell-server-sdk)

  The LaunchDarkly Server-side SDK for Haskell is designed primarily for use in multi-user systems such as web servers and applications. It follows the server-side LaunchDarkly model for multi-user contexts. It is not intended for use in desktop and embedded systems applications.

  ## LaunchDarkly overview

  [LaunchDarkly](https://www.launchdarkly.com) is a feature management platform that serves over 100 billion feature flags daily to help teams build better software, faster. [Get started](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/getting-started) using LaunchDarkly today!

  ## Getting started

  Download a release archive from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/launchdarkly/haskell-server-sdk/releases) for use in your project. Refer to the [SDK documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/server-side/haskell#getting-started) for complete instructions on getting started with using the SDK.

  ## Learn more

  Check out our [documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com) for in-depth instructions on configuring and using LaunchDarkly. You can also head straight to the [complete reference guide for this SDK](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/server-side/haskell).

  ## Testing

  We run integration tests for all our SDKs using a centralized test harness. This approach gives us the ability to test for consistency across SDKs, as well as test networking behavior in a long-running application. These tests cover each method in the SDK, and verify that event sending, flag evaluation, stream reconnection, and other aspects of the SDK all behave correctly.

  ## Contributing

  We encourage pull requests and other contributions from the community. Check out our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to contribute to this SDK.

  ## About LaunchDarkly

  * LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely. We allow you to easily flag your features and manage them from the LaunchDarkly dashboard.  With LaunchDarkly, you can:
      * Roll out a new feature to a subset of your users (like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group), gathering feedback and bug reports from real-world use cases.
      * Gradually roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users, and track the effect that the feature has on key metrics (for instance, how likely is a user to complete a purchase if they have feature A versus feature B?).
      * Turn off a feature that you realize is causing performance problems in production, without needing to re-deploy, or even restart the application with a changed configuration file.
      * Grant access to certain features based on user attributes, like payment plan (eg: users on the â€˜goldâ€™ plan get access to more features than users in the â€˜silverâ€™ plan). Disable parts of your application to facilitate maintenance, without taking everything offline.
  * LaunchDarkly provides feature flag SDKs for a wide variety of languages and technologies. Read [our documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk) for a complete list.
