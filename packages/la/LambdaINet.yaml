description: "LambdaINet\n==========\n\nLambdaINet implements an interaction net based
  optimal evaluator following\nLambdascope [1], with an interactive graphical interface
  allowing user to view\nand directly manipulate interaction net.\n\n[1] Vincent van
  Oostrom, Kees-Jan van de Looij, Marijn Zwitserlood,\nLambdascope, Workshop on Algebra
  and Logic on Programming Systems (ALPS),\nKyoto, April 10th 2004\n\nCHANGES\n=======\n\n*
  \  Tue Sep 1  PDT 2014 - New GUI based on GLFW-task, new layout algorithm.\n                          bump
  version to 0.2.0.0.\n\n*   Tue Sep 15 EDT 2009 - fix GUI on OS X; fix glitch when
  moving nodes. \n                          bump version to 0.1.2.\n\n*   Mon Sep
  14 EDT 2009 - fix the bug with app function, bump version to 0.1.1.\n\nUSAGE\n=====\n\nAfter
  \"cabal install\", just type \"LambdaINet\" to start the application.  Once\nit
  starts, press H for help, and ESC to quit. To understand all the operations\nin
  detail, you'll have to read the above mentioned paper by Oostrom et. al.\n\nCurrently
  there is no way to load input programs except modifying the source,\nTry src/Main.lhs
  if you want to change the start-up program, or any of the \n1..9 preset programs.\n\nAt
  this moment, the object language supports lambda expression with recursion,\ntuples,
  and primitives such as numbers, strings and functions. \n\nSIDE NOTE\n=========\n\nThe
  bulk of code was put together in two weeks when I was working on the leak\nproblem
  for FRP in 2007. So it was really a rushed job with no guarantee of\ncorrectness,
  although I tried to stay faithful to the original paper as much as\nI could. \n\nI
  only did some moderate clean-ups before releasing this application to public,\nand
  the code itself was sparingly documented when it was originally written.\nSome parts
  are probably still buggy, like the translation from net to term;\nother parts could
  use more improvements, like the node positioning and line\nlayout algorithm. But
  I decide to release it anyway -- maybe some people some\nwhere will find it useful.\n\n\nDEVELOPMENT\n===========\n\nPlease
  forward bug reports or feedbacks to me (Paul Liu at paul@thev.net), but\ndon't hold
  your hope high on timely bug fixes. \n\nHelp is also needed to develop LambdaINet
  further, for example, it really needs\na way to read lambda expressions from a separate
  file or standard input, which\nshould be a simple feature to add, but alas! I don't
  have the time in the\nnearest future to do this kind of things myself.\n\n\n----\nLast
