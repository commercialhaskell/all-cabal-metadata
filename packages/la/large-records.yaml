synopsis: Efficient compilation for large records, linear in the size of the record
changelog: "# Revision history for large-records\n\n## 0.3 -- 2022-07-22\n\n* Support
  ghc 9.2 (#117)\n* Support for field strictness annotations (#107)\n\n## 0.2.1.0
  -- 2022-04-06\n\n* Update for `large-generics` 0.2\n\n## 0.2.0.0 -- 2022-03-23 \n\n*
  Avoid all quotes: no more Template Haskell (#63) or quasi-quotes (#43).\n  TH replaced
  by a source-plugin; quasi-quotes avoided by using a different\n  internal representation,
  so that records can be constructed \"as normal\".\n* Removed support for the pattern
  synonym, as it's not needed anymore.\n* Compatible with ghc 8.10 and 9.0 (as well
  as 8.8).\n* `large-generics` split off as a separate package (#45).\n* Remove dependency
  on micro-lens (#27);\n  `Data.Record.Lens.Micro` is now `Data.Record.Generic.Lens.VL`\n
  \ (and lives in `large-generics).\n* Fix some strictness issues (#33).\n* Refactored
  test suite and benchmarks.\n\n## 0.1.0.0 -- 2021-08-19\n\n* First public release.\n"

description: |-
  For many reasons, the internal code generated for modules
  that contain records is quadratic in the number of record
  fields. For large records (more than 30 fields, say), this
  can become problematic, leading to large compilation times
  and high memory requirements for ghc. The large-records
  library provides a way to define records that is guaranteed
  to result in ghc core that is /linear/ in the number of
  record fields.
