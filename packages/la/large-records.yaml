  # Revision history for large-records

  ## 0.4 -- 2023-03-06

  * Fix issue with operator type families used in fields (#120).
  * Fix issue with `NamedWildCards` (#121, #124, #125).
  * Do not generate imports in the plugin (#129).
    NOTE: This means that use code must now import `Data.Record.Plugin` to bring
    `largeRecord` into scope (necessary for `ANN` annotations).
  * Support ghc 9.4 (#131).
    An annoying quirk of ghc 9.4 is that the order of plugins is reversed; this
    matters when using `large-records` and `record-dot-preprocessor` together.
    To avoid CPP, you can now use `Data.Record.Plugin.WithRDP`, which combines
    both plugins.
  * Support `OverloadedRecordDot` and `OverloadedRecordUpdate` (#135).

  ## 0.3 -- 2022-07-22

  * Support ghc 9.2 (#113 / #117).
  * Support for field strictness annotations (#106 / #107).

  ## 0.2.1.0 -- 2022-04-06

  * Update for `large-generics` 0.2

  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2022-03-23

  * Avoid all quotes: no more Template Haskell (#63) or quasi-quotes (#43).
    TH replaced by a source-plugin; quasi-quotes avoided by using a different
    internal representation, so that records can be constructed "as normal".
  * Removed support for the pattern synonym, as it's not needed anymore.
  * Compatible with ghc 8.10 and 9.0 (as well as 8.8).
  * `large-generics` split off as a separate package (#45).
  * Remove dependency on micro-lens (#27);
    `Data.Record.Lens.Micro` is now `Data.Record.Generic.Lens.VL`
    (and lives in `large-generics).
  * Fix some strictness issues (#33).
  * Refactored test suite and benchmarks.

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2021-08-19

  * First public release.

description: |-
  For many reasons, the internal code generated for modules
  that contain records is quadratic in the number of record
  fields. For large records (more than 30 fields, say), this
  can become problematic, leading to large compilation times
  and high memory requirements for ghc. The large-records
  library provides a way to define records that is guaranteed
  to result in ghc core that is /linear/ in the number of
  record fields.
