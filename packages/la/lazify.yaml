  Since early Haskell history, it's been convenient to make values
  stricter using `seq`. Making them lazier has always been a bit
  of a chore. This package offers tools for doing so.

  For an idiomatic classy approach with generic defaults, use
  "Data.Lazify". To just go with whatever the generics say
  (aside from overlapping instances), use "Data.Lazify.Generic".
