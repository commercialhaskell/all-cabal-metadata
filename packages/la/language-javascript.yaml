description: ! "Parser for JavaScript\n---------------------\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/erikd/language-javascript.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/erikd/language-javascript)\n\nBased
  (loosely) on language-python\n\nHow to build\n------------\n\nLibrary:\n\n    cabal
  clean && cabal configure && cabal build\n\nTests:\n\n    cabal clean && cabal configure
  -fbuildtests && cabal build\n\nRunning the tests\n\n    ./dist/build/runtests/runtests\n\n\nTo
  debug the grammar\n\n    happy -iparse.txt -g -a  -d src/Language/JavaScript/Parser/Grammar5.y\n\nThis
  generates src/Language/JavaScript/Parser/Grammar.hs, delete this\nwhen done with
  the debug version\n\n\nUTF8/Unicode version\n--------------------\n\nAlex 3.0 now
  supports unicode natively, and has been included as a\ndependency in the cabal file.\n\nNote:
  The generation of the lexical analyser has been separated out,\n      to remove
  the install-time dependency on Alex. If any changes\n      need to be made to the
  lexer, the Lexer.x source lies in\n      src-dev, and the runalex.sh script will
  invoke Alex with the\n      appropriate directories.\n\nChanges\n-------\n\n```\n0.5.14.5
  Fix parsing of escaped quote characters\n\n0.5.14.4 Remove upper bound on HUnit
  dependency\n\n0.5.14.3 Fix https://github.com/erikd/language-javascript/issues/45\n\n0.5.14.2
  Update Alex dependency\n\n0.5.14.1 Fix haddocks\n\n0.5.14.0 Fix a break/continue/return
  parsing problem\n\n0.5.13.3 Fix utf8-string lower bound typo no 2\n\n0.5.13.2 Fix
  utf8-string lower bound typo\n\n0.5.13.1 Bump utf8-string dependency upper bound,
  and loosen others\n\n0.5.13 Put GHC 7.8.x -specific alex and happy versions, thanks\n
  \      @simonmichael\n\n0.5.12 Put dependency on alex >= 3.0.5 in the cabal file,
  thanks @peti\n\n0.5.11 Remove pre-generated Lexer.hs as it does not work will all\n
  \      versions of GHC. This means a current alex will have to be\n       installed
  before this package can be installed.\n\n0.5.10 Bring in alex 3.1.3, allowing compatibility
  with GHC 7.8\n\n0.5.9 Relax array dependency for GHC 7.8.1, thanks @maoe\n\n0.5.8
  Fixed compilation issue using GHC 7.6.3 on Mac OSX, thanks @albertov\n\n0.5.7 Remove
  the hs-source-dirs from test suite to prevent compilation\n      issues (@nomeata)\n\n
  \     Introduce parseFileUtf8 to explicitly use utf8 for parsing a\n      file,
  and update tests to use it where needed. Closes #21\n\n0.5.6 Remove constraint on
  Alex 3.0.1, it is only required to make\n      changes to the lexer. Closes #19\n\n0.5.5
  Updated version ranges for GHC 7.6.1, courtesy of @mietek\n      Note: requires
  alex 3.0.1 for development (not install)\n\n0.5.4 Fixed bug where lexer switches
  to regexp mode after a ']'\n      char, reported by @aszlig\n\n0.5.3 Merge pull
  requests from @aszlig to add octal support, and to\n      allow leading zeros in
  exponents\n\n0.5.2 Merged pull request from @markwright added some missing test\n
  \     files to the cabal file.\n      Added runalex.sh and Lexer.x to the cabal
  file.\n\n0.5.1 Export CommentAnnotation(..). Simplify AST by getting rid of\n      JSFunctionBody,
  JSSourceElements, JSStatementBlock, JSStatementList.\n      They are replaced by
  JSBlock or a simple list.\n      Also fix lexer mode in presence of whitespace.\n
  \     Changed way tests are invoked, to allow Travis integration.\n\n0.5.0 Rework
  AST to allow full round-trip parsing and output of\n      JavaScript. Breaks AST
  compatibility with prior versions\n\n0.4.10 Moved Lexer.x into a separate directory,
  and made a script to\n       call alex to generate Lexer.hs. This means alex is
  not required\n       at install time\n\n0.4.9 Make alex and happy versions more
  explicit. Expose the AlexSpan\n      data type, so parse error positions can be
  reported.\n\n0.4.8 Close issue https://github.com/erikd/language-javascript/issues/5
  by\n      correcting the lexical analyser for DecimalLiteral\n\n0.4.7 Continue ECMASCRIPT
  update, remove incorrect future reserved words for\n      \"code\", \"mode\", \"of\",
  \"one\", \"or\" and \"strict\", put in by accident/stupidity.\n\n0.4.6 Update to
  ECMASCRIPT 5.1 by allowing continuations in string literals\n      Include build
  dependencies on alex >= 3.0 and happy.\n\n0.4.5 Update cabal file and docs for Alex
  3.0, giving out of the box unicode support\n\n0.4.4 Allow unicode characters in
  comments\n\n0.4.3 correct lexer for decimalToken, only leading digit needs to be
  non-zero.\n\n0.4.2 Expose SrcSpan\n\n0.4.1 Expose AST.Node as well.\n\n0.4.0 Updated
  JSNode to include location information, and made the parse more true to the original
  by leaving blocks as such, not replacing with ';'.\n\n0.3.0 ECMA-262 edition 5 compliance.
  \ Required adding JSFunctionExpression and JSPropertyAccessor to the AST.\n\n0.2.2
  Heading toward compliance with edition 5. Trailing commas allowed in array literals
  too.\n\n0.2.1 Allow trailing comma in object literal\n\n0.2.0 ECMAScript 3 allows
  function expressions to have names, AST.JSFunctionExpression now reflects this\n\n0.1.0
  Simplified AST by removing JSElement and JSElementList components\n\n0.0.3 Support
  for unicode in source. At the moment it only supports\nUTF8 encoding, does not recognise
  byte order marks or UTF-16/UTF-32\n\n0.0.2 Multiline comments were processed in
  greedy form, now end of\ncomment recognised properly. Thanks to Tony Morris for
  reporting this.\n\n0.0.1 Initial release\n```\n\nEOF\n\n"
