  λtext
  =====

  > General-Purpose Templating Utility

  # Overview

  λtext turns text files into higher-order functions, featuring a Hindley-Milner /
  prenex polymorphic type system. See the [github.io page](http://ltext.github.io/).

  ## Building

  ```bash
  $> git clone git@github.com/ltext/ltext
  $> cd ltext
  $> stack install ltext
  ```

  This should install in one pass; all the non-stackage dependencies are included
  in `stack.yaml`.

  ## Usage

  ```bash
  $> ltext --help

  λtext - parameterized file evaluator

  Usage: ltext EXPRESSION [--version] [-t|--type] [-v|--verbose] [-r|--raw FILE]
               [--left LEFT] [--right RIGHT]
    Evaluate EXPRESSION and send the substitution to stdout. See
    http://ltext.github.io/ for more details.

  Available options:
    -h,--help                Show this help text
    --version                Print the version number
    -t,--type                Perform type inference on an expression
    -v,--verbose             Be verbose, sending info through stderr
    -r,--raw FILE            Treat these files as plaintext without an arity
                             header
    --left LEFT              The left delimiter to use for rendering partially
                             applied files
    --right RIGHT            The right delimiter to use for rendering partially
                             applied files

  $> ltext --type "\a -> a"

  a0 -> a0
  ```

  ## How It Works

  From λtext's point of view, _any text file_ can be a template (given that
  it's utf-8 encoded). Just declare parameters in the first line of
  your files (usually in a different syntax than the file's native tongue,
  via comments or obscure delimiters), then use those variables somewhere in
  the content. With the `ltext` command you can then apply the function-y
  files to each other.

  ### The CLI

  There will be two primary uses of the `ltext` command - evaluating template
  expressions, and querying for the type signature of a template/expression.

  #### Type Queries

  Just like the `:t` command in GHCi, you can find out the type of a template or
  expression with `-t`.

  #### Expression Evaluation

  All files have __closed scope__, meaning they only have access to the variables
  declared in the file. For instance:

  ```
  {{ foo }}

  ...
  ```

  Will _only_ have access to the variable `foo`, while using the delimiters `{{`
  and `}}` to escape your expression.

  #### Variable Recognition

  When we use a parameter in a file, we need it to be easily recognized by a parser;
  a different syntax than to the language you're working with.

  The first line in a file will be parsed to see if it qualifies as a
  lambda header. If you don't want a file have recognized arity, just invoke `ltext`
  with the `--raw` argument listing the file:

  ```bash
  $> ltext "foo bar" --raw "bar"
  ```
