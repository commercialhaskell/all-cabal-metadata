  # Revision history for skeletal-set

  ## 0.2.0.0  -- 2018-04-24

  * Rename Setoid to Skeletal Set to better represent what this
    data structure is actually is. What we were thinking to be a setoid
    turnd out to be wrong, as we do not implement the setoid in a general
    sense of its definition.

  ## 0.1.0.0  -- 2017-01-17

  * Initial extract of Setoid into a standalone library.

description: "# Skeletal Set\n\nSkeletal set is a set equipped with an equivalence
  relation. It is a useful data structure in cases where equivalence is chosen not
  to be equality. One can use it to influence the memberships of the elements more
  strictly than in sets, and run computations when conflicts between elements are
  found.\n\nFor more in-depth explanations and examples, please have a look at the\ndocumentation
  on hackage.\n\n### Copyright:\n* [Global Access Internet Services GmbH](http://www.global.de)\n\n###
