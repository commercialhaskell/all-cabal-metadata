changelog: ! "# Revision history for skylighting\n\n## 0.7.3 -- 2018-08-27\n\n  *
  Add Sylighting.Syntax.Default and 'default' language. This\n    just highlights
  everything as normal text.\n  * Require base >= 4.8.  Drop support for ghc 7.8.\n\n##
  0.7.2 -- 2018-06-08\n\n  * Require skylighting-core >= 0.7.2.\n\n## 0.7.1 -- 2018-03-15\n\n
  \ * Require skylighting-core >= 0.7.1.\n\n## 0.7.0.2 -- 2018-03-06\n\n  * Require
  skylighting-core >= 0.7.0.2.\n\n## 0.7.0.1 -- 2018-03-03\n\n  * Updated changelog.md.\n\n##
  0.7 -- 2018-03-03\n\n  * Split skylighting into skylighting-core (BSD3) and skylighting
  (GPL)\n    (#37, Jonathan Daugherty).  skylighting-core (BSD3 licensed) includes\n
  \   the core library functionality and the source of the XML syntax, but\n    not
  the compiled Syntax modules, and skylighting (GPL2 licensed)\n    includes Syntax
  modules compiled from the XML syntax files.\n\n  * We discontinue support for GHC
  before 7.10 (because we need to support the\n    reexport-modules Cabal directive.)\n\n
  \ * Print message about loaded syntax defs to stderr (#36).\n\n  * New module Skylighting.Loader,
  exporting\n    `loadSyntaxFromFile` and `loadSyntaxesFromDir` (Jonathan Daugherty).\n\n
  \ * Adjust tests to load xml definitions dynamically.\n\n## 0.6 -- 2018-01-18\n\n
  \ * Add ANSI color output (Alexander Ronald Altman, #22).\n\n    + New package dependencies:
  `ansi-terminal` and `colour`.\n    + New module: `Skylighting.Format.ANSI`, exporting
  `formatANSI`,\n      (also reexported from the module `Skylighting`).\n    + In
  `Skylighting.Types`, new types `ANSIColorLevel` and\n      `Xterm256ColorCode`,
  and a new field `ansiColorLevel` in\n      `FormatOptions`.\n    + Main `skylighting`
  executable now supports ANSI output (use\n      `ansi` as argument to `--format`),
  which is now the default output\n      format. A new flag `--color-level` has been
  added to select\n      the number of colors (with options `16`, `256`, `true`, and\n
  \     the default `auto`).\n\n  * Reword error for missing contexts in IncludeRules.\n\n
  \ * Use ordNub instead of nub for missingIncludes.\n\n## 0.5.1 -- 2018-01-07\n\n
  \ * Fixed tokenizer exceptions (#31).  Previously `throwError`\n    did not actually
  generate `Left` results in `tokenize`,\n    because of the way the MonadPlus instance
  worked. Rewrote\n    the TokenizerM monad from scratch so that exceptions would\n
  \   not be skipped.\n\n  * Improved error message about undefined contexts.\n\n
  \ * Makefile: use cabal for bootstrap target.\n\n  * README: remove stack bootstrap
  instructions.\n    You can no longer bootstrap with stack, because it\n    insists
  on building ALL the executables the first time,\n    and of course that can't be
  done with this library.\n\n  * Use quickcheck for fuzz test.\n\n## 0.5.0.1 -- 2017-12-18\n\n
  \ * Small improvements to fuzz tests in test suite.  We now\n    ensure that we
  print the random text on test failure.  Also,\n    we now run the test with many
  smaller samples rather than\n    one big one.\n\n  * Add aeson lower bound (because
  of toEncoding) (#28).\n\n## 0.5 -- 2017-12-10\n\n  * Fix line spacing and overflowing
  content in generated HTML\n    (David Baynard, #25, see jgm/pandoc#4128).\n\n    +
  Fix empty line height, explicitly\n    + Ensure long lines scroll on screen\n    +
  Only apply colour to the outer div\n    + Don't reset line number colour\n    +
  Fix borders on empty code lines\n    + Collapse divs correctly.\n\n  * Changes to
  Style types and JSON instances.  Previously we could not\n    successfully round-trip
  through JSON.\n\n    + `tokenStyles` is now a map rather than an association list.\n
  \   + We now use `line-number-color` instead of `line-numbers` at\n      the top
  level in the JSON instances, falling back to\n      `line-numbers` in `editor-colors`,
  for KDE theme compatibility.\n    + We use `line-number-background-color` at the
  top level, falling\n      back to the text background color.\n    + We use `text-color`
  at the top level, falling back to the `text-color`\n      of the `Normal` token
  style if it exists, for KDE compatibility.\n    + We use `background-color` at the
  top level, falling back to\n      the `background-color` in `editor-colors`, for
  KDE compatibility.\n    + A round-trip JSON test has been added.\n\n## 0.4.4.1 --
  2017-11-27\n\n  * HTML formatting: fix color, bgcolor when numbering enabled.\n
  \   Previously, the code got the color and background color\n    the numbers were
  supposed to get.  See jgm/pandoc #4103.\n  * Updated syntax descriptions for bash,
  clojure, commonlisp, diff,\n    dockerfile, doxygen, doxygenlua, fsharp, hamlet,
  haskell, haxe,\n    java, javascript, julia, latex, literate-curry, literate-haskell,\n
  \   makefile, mediawiki, monobasic, ocaml, prolog, r, relaxng, scala,\n    sci,
  sql-mysql, sql-postgresql, sql, xslt.\n  * test program:  use --accept instead of
  --regen.\n\n## 0.4.4 -- 2017-11-21\n\n  * HTML formatter: always use an a element
  (rather than a div)\n    for source lines.  The divs were invalid, because code\n
  \   elements must contain phrasing content.  Previously we used\n    a elements
  when line anchors were called for, but there is\n    no clear reason not to use
  them always.\n  * skylighting binary: add doctype to generated HTML.\n\n## 0.4.3.2
  -- 2017-11-04\n\n  * Fixed regression in `data-line-number` attributes in HTML\n
  \   output.  We should not include the `lineIdPrefix` in\n    front of this.\n\n##
  0.4.3.1 -- 2017-11-03\n\n  * Fixed typo in css (Artymort).\n  * Fixed travis build
  times.\n\n## 0.4.3 --- 2017-11-02\n\n  * `FormatOptions`: added `lineIdPrefix` (jgm/pandoc#4031).\n
  \   This is needed because a web page may contain several\n    code samples, and
  we need to make sure that the ids on\n    lines are unique.\n  * HTML formatter:
  use `lineIdPrefix` in ids for lines.\n  * HTML formatter: Don't put href attributes
  on divs.\n\n## 0.4.2 --- 2017-10-26\n\n  * HTML output: remove outer div.  This
  prevented margin\n    collapsing between the pre and surrounding block elements,\n
  \   and often gave us excess white space around code blocks.\n    See jgm/pandoc#3996.\n\n##
  0.4.1 --- 2017-09-28\n\n  * Updated XML definitions from KDE repository.\n    Changed:
  actionscript, ada, agda, alert, alert_indent, asn1, awk, bash,\n    boo, c, changelog,
  clojure, cmake, coldfusion, commonlisp, cpp, cs, css,\n    curry, d, dockerfile,
  dot, doxygen, doxygenlua, eiffel, email, erlang,\n    fortran, fsharp, gcc, haskell,
  haxe, isocpp, java, javascript, jsp, julia,\n    lilypond, lua, m4, makefile, matlab,
  maxima, mips, modelines, modula-2,\n    monobasic, objectivec, objectivecpp, ocaml,
  octave, opencl, pascal, perl,\n    php, pike, postscript, prolog, purebasic, python,
  r, relaxng,\n    relaxngcompact, rest, rhtml, ruby, rust, scala, scheme, sci, sql-mysql,\n
  \   sql-postgresql, sql, tcl, tcsh, verilog, vhdl, xml, xslt, xul, zsh.\n  * Added
  support for powershell, using definition from KDE repository.\n  * Stop terminating
  long builds on TravisCI (Kyle Ondy).\n\n## 0.4 --- 2017-09-15\n\n  * Removed ToJSON/FromJSON
  instances for KeywordAttr,\n    WordSet, Matcher, Context, ContextSwitch, Rule,
  Syntax\n    (added in 0.3.5).  Creating these increased the memory\n    requirements
  for compiling skylighting to a degree not\n    justified by the usefulness of these
  instances.\n\n## 0.3.5 --- 2017-09-14\n\n  * Added ToJSON/FromJSON instances for
  all basic types.\n  * Added some background colors to 'kate' style, matching default.theme,\n
  \   and made FromJSON for Style sensitive to background-color.\n\n## 0.3.4.1 --
  2017-09-09\n\n  * HTML formatting: do not use `div` elements for source\n    lines
  in inline output.\n\n## 0.3.4 -- 2017-09-09\n\n  * HTML formatting changes (David
  Baynard).  Note that these\n    changes may require changes in hard-coded CSS that
  is\n    used with skylighting's HTML output.\n\n    + Wrap lines of source code
  in a `div` with `display` set to\n      `inline-block`.  The `div`s make per-line
  processing easier.\n      They cannot be set as `display: block` as that introduces
  extra\n      new lines when copying and pasting.\n    + Render line numbers in html
  using CSS pseudo elements rather than\n      a table.  The line numbers are always
  produced, as `data-line-number`\n      attributes, and css to display them as `::before`
  elements are\n      always produced. The option to switch on line numbering only\n
  \     toggles a class; this means it is possible to toggle line numbering\n      without
  re-running skylighting.\n    + If the `linkAnchors` option is set, wrap with an
  `a` element rather\n      than a `div`, set so that clicking the line number (and
  only the\n      line number) will jump to that line.\n    + Code wraps by default
  when html is printed, with wrapped lines\n      indented.\n\n## 0.3.3.1 -- 2017-06-26\n\n
  \ * Updated xml syntax definitions and clojure test.\n  * Improved 'make update-xml'
  target.\n  * Updated version bound for criterion.\n\n## 0.3.3 -- 2017-04-22\n\n
  \ * Revert change from 0.3.2; now entities from a DTD are\n    resolved if the DTD
  element is included.  This is needed\n    for agda.xml and some others.  If you
  want to use a custom\n    xml definition without needing language.dtd, just remove\n
  \   the reference to language.dtd in your xml file.\n  * Added `case` keyword for
  ats (Hanwen (Steinway) Wu).\n\n## 0.3.2 -- 2017-04-01\n\n  * Parse xml definitions
  without resolving entities from\n    language.dtd.  This allows xml definitions
  to be used even\n    when language.dtd isn't available.  Existing definitions\n
  \   don't rely on the two or three entities definied in\n    language.dtd, so this
  is harmless.\n  * Small optimizations.\n\n## 0.3.1 -- 2017-02-28\n\n  * Use handwritten
  parser for Float instead of regex.  Fixes\n    jgm/highlighting-kate#57 (again).\n
  \ * Added float parsing tests.\n  * Use parsec parsers, not regex, for CStringChar
  and CChar.\n  * Rewrote Int, Hex, Oct, CStringChar, CCHar parsers with parsec\n
  \   instead of regex.  This speeds things up.\n  * Don't include leading + in Int,
  Hex, Oct parsers.  That gives\n    bad results for things like `i+1`.\n\n## 0.3
  -- 2017-02-19\n\n  * Store literal binary-encoded representations of the Syntax\n
  \   structure in Skylighting.Syntax.*.hs, instead of the\n    structure itself.
  \ This works around a problem ghc has\n    compiling modules with large structures.
  \ This indirect method\n    produces faster compile times and avoids massive memory
  usage by\n    ghc (especially in profiling builds).  For background see\n    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16348340/.
  \ Closes #7.\n  * Types: Internals of 'WordSet' are no longer exposed.\n\n## 0.2
  -- 2017-02-19\n\n  * Restore Data, Typeable, Generic instances for basic types.\n
  \   To do this, we remove reCompiled field from RE (API change).  Instead, we\n
  \   have the tokenizer compile regexes the first time it encounters them,\n    memoizing
  the results.  Performance is not significantly worse.\n  * Skylighting.Syntax.*:
  \ use string representation of the Syntax,\n    which is then 'read', rather than
  including the code for the data\n    structure directly (#7).  This indirect method
  produces faster compile\n    times and avoids massive memory usage by ghc (especially
  in profiling\n    builds).  For background see\n    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16348340/compiling-very-large-constants-with-ghc\n
  \ * Use -fprof-auto-exported for profiling builds.\n  * Added benchmark for xml
  syntax definition parsing.\n  * Patched perl.xml (improperly escaped regex) (#8).\n
  \   This fixes a perl regex compilation error for regex patterns\n    with backslash
  as delimiter, e.g. m\\a\\.\n  * Add a flag to build with system pcre (Felix Yan).\n\n##
  0.1.1.5  -- 2017-02-03\n\n  * Avoid depending on a PrintfArg instance for Text (#5).\n
  \   This isn't provided in some older versions of the text library.\n    This change
  should allow the package to build on older platforms.\n\n## 0.1.1.4  -- 2017-01-31\n\n
  \ * Properly escape characters in subDynamic.\n    This fixes a problem that caused
  failures with\n\n        echo -e \"s\\0b\\0c\" | skylighting -s perl\n\n  * More
  efficient rewrite of char escaping for regexes.\n\n## 0.1.1.3  -- 2017-01-29\n\n
  \ * Increase test timeout to 6s.\n  * Avoid double {{}} in latex macros.\n  * Fixed
  problem compiling Format.LaTeX on older ghc versions (7.8.3)\n    that can't take
  a Text as PrintfArg.\n\n## 0.1.1.2  -- 2017-01-28\n\n  * Added much more extensive
  testing to ensure that tokenizers\n    don't hang or drop input.\n  * Fixed some
  issues with line-end and fallthrough context\n    handling.\n  * Fixed a bug in
  WordDetect handling which caused it to drop\n    input (#2).\n\n## 0.1.1.1  -- 2017-01-21\n\n
  \ * Optimized.  Speed is now comparable to highlighting-kate\n    and often better.\n
  \ * Added benchmarks.\n\n## 0.1.1    -- 2017-01-19\n\n  * Added breezeDark style,
  from breeze-dark.theme.\n  * Fixed performance bug in regex application (#1).  This
  gives a\n    significant speedup, especially for inputs with long lines.\n\n## 0.1.0.1
  \ -- 2016-12-23\n\n  * Fixed bug in LaTeX renderer (backslash in wrong position).\n\n##
  0.1.0.0  -- 2016-12-23\n\n  * Initial release\n\n"

  |\n\nA Haskell syntax highlighting library with tokenizers derived\nfrom KDE XML
  syntax highlighting descriptions.\n\nA command-line highlighter program, `skylighting`,
  is also provided.\n\nThis project is divided up into two packages:\n\n * `skylighting-core`:
  this provides KDE XML parsing, data types,\n   and output formatters. This includes
  the core functionality of the\n   skylighting project licensed under the BSD3 license,
  along with the\n   KDE XML files, some of which are licensed under the LGPL or GPL.
  This\n   package does not provide any built-in parsers corresponding to the\n   XML
  descriptions, however. For that, use `skylighting`.\n * `skylighting`: this exposes
  the `skylighting-core` API but also\n   provides bundled Haskell parser modules
  derived from the XML\n   descriptions in the `core` package. This package is entirely
  licensed\n   under the GPL.\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nThis library is the successor
  to [highlighting-kate], which had\nsome problems that were difficult to resolve
  given its\narchitecture.\n\nIn highlighting-kate, the XML syntax descriptions were
  converted\ninto individual parsec parsers, which were then compiled.  This\nmade
  it difficult to handle IncludeRules properly without\ncircular imports.  There was
  also no way to load a syntax\ndescription dynamically.\n\nSkylighting, by contrast,
  parses the XML syntax descriptions\ninto Haskell data structures, which are then
  interpreted by\na \"tokenize\" function.  IncludeRules can now be handled\nproperly,
  and users can add new syntax descriptions\ndynamically.  It is also now possible
  to convert `.theme` files\ndirectly into styles.\n\nSkylighting is also faster than
  highlighting-kate, by a\nfactor of 3 in some cases.\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nTo
  install the latest release from Hackage, do\n\n    stack install skylighting\nor\n\n
  \   cabal install skylighting\n\nIf you want the command-line tool, set the `executable`
  flag\nusing `--flag \"skylighting:executable\"` in stack or\n`-fexecutable` in cabal.\n\nThe
  release tarball for the `skylighting` package includes generated\nfiles not present
  in this repository. Building from this repository is\na two-step process. In the
  first step we build the `skylighting-core`\npackage, which provides a program, `skylighting-extract`,
  which reads\nXML syntax highlighting definitions from the `xml` directory and writes\nHaskell
  source files. In the second we actually build the `skylighting`\npackage.\n\nUsing
  cabal:\n\n    cabal install -fexecutable\n    # or stack install --flag skylighting-core:executable\n
  \   cd skylighting\n    skylighting-extract /path/to/skylighting-core/xml/*.xml\n
  \   cabal install -fexecutable\n    # or stack install --flag skylighting:executable\n\nCommand-line
  tool\n-----------------\n\nA command-line executable, `skylighting`, is installed
  if\nthe `executable` cabal flag is set in building.\n\nFor help, `skylighting --help`.\n\nAdding
  new syntaxes\n-------------------\n\nTo compile with additional syntaxes, simply
  add the syntax definition\n(XML) file to the `xml` directory of the `skylighting-core`
  package and\nrepeat the bootstrap build described above.\n\nNote that both the library
  and the executable can dynamically load\nsyntax definitions, so you may not need
  to compile them in. If you\nprefer this approach, you can use the `skylighting-core`
  package\ndirectly which provides the XML files without the generated code\nproduced
  by the bootstrap process described above.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThe `skylighting`
  package is licensed under the GPL because some of the\nXML syntax descriptions from
  which its tokenizers are generated are\nGPL-licensed. However, the `skylighting-core`
  package, which provides\nthe core types and functions of this project is licensed
  under the BSD3\nlicense and bundles the GPL-licensed XML files separately.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nKate
