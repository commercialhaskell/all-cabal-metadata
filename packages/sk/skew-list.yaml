  This package provides ordinary random access list, 'SkewList'
  implemented using skew binary approach.

  It's worth comparing to ordinary lists, binary random access list (as in @ral@ package) and vectors (@vector@ package)
  across two operations: indexing and consing.

  +------------------------------+------------+----------+
  |                              | Consing    | Indexing |
  +------------------------------+------------+----------+
  | Ordinary list, @[a]@         | O(1)       | O(n)     |
  +------------------------------+------------+----------+
  | Binary list, @RAList a@      | O(log n)   | O(log n) |
  +------------------------------+------------+----------+
  | Vector, @Vector@             | O(n)       | O(1)     |
  +------------------------------+------------+----------+
  | Sequence, @Seq@              | O(1)       | O(log n) |
  +------------------------------+------------+----------+
  | Skew binary list, @SkewList@ | O(1)       | O(log n) |
  +------------------------------+------------+----------+

  @SkewList@ improves upon ordinary list, the cons operation is still
  constant time (though with higher constant factor), but indexing
  can be done in a logarithmic time.

  Binary list cons is slower, as it might need to walk over whole
  /log n/ sized structure.

  @Vector@ is the other end of trade-off spectrum: indexing is constant time
  operation, but consing a new element will need to copy whole spine.

  @Seq@ from "Data.Sequence" has similar (but amortized) complexity bounds for
  cons and index as @SkewList@.  However (it seems) that indexing is quicker for
  @SkewList@ in practice. Also @SkewList@ has strict spine.
  On the other hand, @Seq@ has quick append if you need that.

  If you need both: fast consing and index, consider using @SkewList@.
