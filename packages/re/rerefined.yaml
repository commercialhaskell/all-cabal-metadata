  Rewrite of Nikita Volkov's [refined][refined-nv-hackage] library.

  * same concept
  * same performance
  * more instances
  * better ergonomics (no insidious `Typeable` constraints)
  * internals: fewer dependencies (no `aeson`), better errors, more concise

  ## Why?
  I used the original [refined][refined-nv-hackage] library fairly extensively to
  power other libraries (see [strongweak][strongweak-hackage],
  [binrep][binrep-hackage]), though I moved to a fork [refined1][refined1-hackage]
  some time ago to provide a feature I needed. I think the library has some flaws
  and I want to contribute, but my tiny tweaks are still pending after a few
  years. A good excuse to rewrite from the ground up.

  All source code is original.

  ## Major changes from original refined
  ### Simplified errors
  refined encoded the logical predicates in its error type. This doesn't enable
  any further analysis, just turns a non-sum type into a sum type and complicates
  consumption. Furthermore, this error type is first transformed into another
  recursive ADT, which is then pretty printed. This is unnecessary (even mentioned
  in the code).

  rerefined has a single-constructor error type which can be easily and
  efficiently turned into a `String` in a single pass.

  ### No insidious `Typeable` contexts
  See [refined#101](https://github.com/nikita-volkov/refined/issues/101).
  `Typeable` is useful, but the way it is used brings lots of `Typeable` contexts.

  rerefined has predicates declare their "predicate name" explicitly. You can
  still use `Typeable` for non-combinator predicates, where no `Typeable` contexts
  are incurred, but combinator predicates such as binary logical predicates
  require more work. However, you can use all the existing `ShowS` helpers (that's
  how `typeRep`s are printed anyway), so it's just like writing a manual `Show`
  instance! Plus, combinator predicates are fairly unusual, so library users will
  probably never see this.

  Note that this change also improves predicate name display, since `typeRep`
  tries to display inferred/hidden kinds for wrapped predicates in combinator
  predicates, which are uninteresting. We can ignore these in our manual
  instances!

  ### Cleaner design
  What do `LessThan`, `GreaterThan`, `EqualTo` etc. have in common? They're all
  relational binary operators where one value is a pre-filled `Natural`. rerefined
  packs all of these into a single predicate that takes a type-level relational
  operator. Only one instance for the same amount of code, and much easier to
  reason about.

  We take this even further and allow passing a type-level sign, to enable
  comparing negative values.

  We take this _even_ further and use the same relational operator definitions to
  define length comparisons, where the other value is taken from the input's
  length (rather than its numeric value). This does not take a sign, since length
  must be non-negative.

  ### More instances
  You know that length comparison predicate above? It has a _single instance_ for
  each of `Refined1` and `Refined`:

  ```haskell
  -- | Compare the length of a 'Foldable' to a type-level 'Natural' using the
  --   given 'RelOp'.
  instance (KnownNat n, Foldable f, ReifyRelOp op)
    => Refine1 (CompareLength op n) f where
      validate1 p = validateCompareLength p . length

  -- | Compare the length of a 'MonoFoldable' to a type-level 'Natural' using the
  --   given 'RelOp'.
  instance (KnownNat n, MonoFoldable a, ReifyRelOp op)
    => Refine (CompareLength op n) a where
      validate p = validateCompareLength p . olength
  ```

  We get a ton more instances for a ton less code. (Note that mono-foldable has a
  surprisingly small footprint, as most of its transitive dependencies are core
  libraries.)
