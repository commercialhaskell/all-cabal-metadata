  This library is deprecated in favour of the hedis package,
  but minor patches to keep it building etc will be applied.


  Redis (<http://redis.io>) is an open source, BSD licensed, advanced
  key-value store. It is often referred as a data structure server
  since keys can contain different data structures, such as strings,
  hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets.

  This library is a Haskell driver for Redis. It's tested with
  current git version and with v2.4.6 of redis server. It also
  tested with v2.2 and basic functions are works correctly
  but not all of them.

  You can use Test module from the source package to run unit
  tests. Try /runhaskell Test.hs --help/ for usage info. Caution! Do not
  run tests on your working database - test database will be
  flushed.

  There are simple benchmark module included: Benchmark.hs. It shows
  me about two times less requests per second than redis-benchmark
  from server distribution.

  Please let me know if tests or benchmark goes terribly wrong.

  Changes from v0.12:
