synopsis: Reifies arbitrary terms into types that can be reflected back into terms
changelog: ! "# 2.1.4 [2018.07.02]\n* Allow building with GHC 8.6.\n\n# 2.1.3 [2018.01.18]\n*
  Add `Semigroup` instance for `ReflectedMonoid`.\n\n# 2.1.2\n* Support cross-compilation
  and unregistered GHC builds.\n\n# 2.1.1.1\n* Fixed typos in the documentation.\n\n#
  2.1.1\n* Fixed support for GHC 7.0\n\n# 2.1\n* Added `ReifiedMonoid` and `ReifiedApplicative`.\n\n#
  2\n* Added `reifyNat` and `reifySymbol` for GHC 7.8+, capable of reflecting into
  the `KnownNat` and `KnownSymbol` classes respectively for use with other APIs.\n*
  Back-ported `reifyTypeable` from `lens`. This enables us to perform a (less efficient)
  form of `Typeable` reflection.\n\n# 1.5.2\n* Renamed the flag for disabling the
  use of `template-haskell`, to `-f-template-haskell` for consistency with my other
  packages.\n\n# 1.5.1.2\n* Builds warning-free on GHC 7.10.\n* Added a dynamic FromJSON
  example.\n\n# 1.5.1.1\n* Updated the link to the paper.\n* More examples.\n\n# 1.5.1\n*
  We no longer export Show (Q a) for GHC >= 7.4. This was causing random hangs when
  users tried to somehow run declaration splices from the REPL.\n* We no longer depend
  on tagged for GHC >= 7.8, since `Proxy` is now in `base`.\n\n# 1.5\n* Added a flag
  to disable `template-haskell` support for GHC stage1 platforms.\n* Added instances
  of `Reifies` for `GHC.TypeLits`\n\n# 1.4\n* Changed the behavior of the $(1) template
  haskell splices for Exp to use a Proxy rather than value-level numbers. This is
  more consistent with the role of this libraary and the other could always be generated
  via sa splice anyways.\n\n# 1.3.1\n* Added a workaround for changes in the behavior
  of the internal 'Magic' datatype under the current GHC PolyKinds implementation.\n\n#
  1.3\n* Merged some functionality from Data.Analytics.Reflection. Notably the ability
  to use type nats to reflect numbers, and to splice numbers directly. This reduces
  orphan instances somewhat.\n\n# 1.2\n* Added `Given` and give.\n\n# 1.1.7\n* Fixed
  an issue caused by changes in GHC 7.7's typechecker by using explicit `ScopedTypeVariables`.\n\n#
  1.1.6:\n* Relaxed an unnecessary strictness annotation in the fast implementation\n\n#
  1.1.5\n* Both implementations now work on Hugs; the fast implementation ascends\n
  \ from the ranks of completely unportable black magic to being merely\n  /mostly/
  unportable black magic.\n\n# From 0.5 to 1.1:\n\n* Much faster implementation available
  that is about 50 /times/ faster than\n  0.9 and which runs purely on black magic.
  This version is now used by\n  default. To turn it off install with the `slow` flag.
  If you encounter a\n  problem with the implementation, please contact the author.\n*
  Removed `ReifiedNum`, `reflectNum`, and `reifyIntegral`; `reify` and\n  `reflect`
  are about 3 orders of magnitude faster than the special case\n  combinators were.\n\n#
  0.5\n* Generalized the type signatures in reflect to allow you to pass any type\n
  \ with kind `* -> *` wrapped around the desired type as the phantom type\n  argument
  rather than just a `Proxy`.\n\n# 0.4\n* Converted from `Data.Tagged` to using `Data.Proxy`
  for reflection. This\n  reduces the need for helper functions and scoped type variables
  in user\n  code.\n"

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/reflection.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/reflection)
  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ekmett/reflection.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ekmett/reflection)


  This package provides an implementation of the ideas presented in [Functional Pearl:
  Implicit Configurations](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/tr-15-04.pdf) by Oleg Kiselyov
  and Chung-Chieh Shan. However, the API has been implemented in a much more efficient
  manner.
