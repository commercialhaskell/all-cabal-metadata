synopsis: Reifies arbitrary terms into types that can be reflected back into terms
changelog: |
  # 2.1.5 [2019.08.27]
  * Fix a bug in which `reifyNat` would yield incorrect results for very large
    `Integer`s on GHC 8.2 or later.

  # 2.1.4 [2018.07.02]
  * Allow building with GHC 8.6.

  # 2.1.3 [2018.01.18]
  * Add `Semigroup` instance for `ReflectedMonoid`.

  # 2.1.2
  * Support cross-compilation and unregistered GHC builds.

  # 2.1.1.1
  * Fixed typos in the documentation.

  # 2.1.1
  * Fixed support for GHC 7.0

  # 2.1
  * Added `ReifiedMonoid` and `ReifiedApplicative`.

  # 2
  * Added `reifyNat` and `reifySymbol` for GHC 7.8+, capable of reflecting into the `KnownNat` and `KnownSymbol` classes respectively for use with other APIs.
  * Back-ported `reifyTypeable` from `lens`. This enables us to perform a (less efficient) form of `Typeable` reflection.

  # 1.5.2
  * Renamed the flag for disabling the use of `template-haskell`, to `-f-template-haskell` for consistency with my other packages.

  # 1.5.1.2
  * Builds warning-free on GHC 7.10.
  * Added a dynamic FromJSON example.

  # 1.5.1.1
  * Updated the link to the paper.
  * More examples.

  # 1.5.1
  * We no longer export Show (Q a) for GHC >= 7.4. This was causing random hangs when users tried to somehow run declaration splices from the REPL.
  * We no longer depend on tagged for GHC >= 7.8, since `Proxy` is now in `base`.

  # 1.5
  * Added a flag to disable `template-haskell` support for GHC stage1 platforms.
  * Added instances of `Reifies` for `GHC.TypeLits`

  # 1.4
  * Changed the behavior of the $(1) template haskell splices for Exp to use a Proxy rather than value-level numbers. This is more consistent with the role of this libraary and the other could always be generated via sa splice anyways.

  # 1.3.1
  * Added a workaround for changes in the behavior of the internal 'Magic' datatype under the current GHC PolyKinds implementation.

  # 1.3
  * Merged some functionality from Data.Analytics.Reflection. Notably the ability to use type nats to reflect numbers, and to splice numbers directly. This reduces orphan instances somewhat.

  # 1.2
  * Added `Given` and give.

  # 1.1.7
  * Fixed an issue caused by changes in GHC 7.7's typechecker by using explicit `ScopedTypeVariables`.

  # 1.1.6:
  * Relaxed an unnecessary strictness annotation in the fast implementation

  # 1.1.5
  * Both implementations now work on Hugs; the fast implementation ascends
    from the ranks of completely unportable black magic to being merely
    /mostly/ unportable black magic.

  # From 0.5 to 1.1:

  * Much faster implementation available that is about 50 /times/ faster than
    0.9 and which runs purely on black magic. This version is now used by
    default. To turn it off install with the `slow` flag. If you encounter a
    problem with the implementation, please contact the author.
  * Removed `ReifiedNum`, `reflectNum`, and `reifyIntegral`; `reify` and
    `reflect` are about 3 orders of magnitude faster than the special case
    combinators were.

  # 0.5
  * Generalized the type signatures in reflect to allow you to pass any type
    with kind `* -> *` wrapped around the desired type as the phantom type
    argument rather than just a `Proxy`.

  # 0.4
  * Converted from `Data.Tagged` to using `Data.Proxy` for reflection. This
    reduces the need for helper functions and scoped type variables in user
    code.

  reflection
  ==========

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/reflection.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/reflection) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ekmett/reflection.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ekmett/reflection)

  This package provides an implementation of the ideas presented in [Functional Pearl: Implicit Configurations](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/tr-15-04.pdf) by Oleg Kiselyov and Chung-Chieh Shan. However, the API has been implemented in a much more efficient manner.
