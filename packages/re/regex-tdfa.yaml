  # regex-tdfa

  This is [`regex-tdfa`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/regex-tdfa) which is a pure Haskell regular expression library (for POSIX extended regular expressions) originally written by Christopher Kuklewicz.

  The name "tdfa" stands for Tagged-DFA.

  ## Getting started

  ### Importing and using

  [Declare a dependency](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/developing-packages.html#pkg-field-build-depends) on the `regex-tdfa` library in your `.cabal` file:

  ```
  build-depends: regex-tdfa ^>= 1.3.2
  ```

  In Haskell modules where you need to use regexes `import` the respective `regex-tdfa` module:

  ```haskell
  import Text.Regex.TDFA
  ```

  ### Basics

  ```haskell
  λ> emailRegex = "[a-zA-Z0-9+._-]+@[a-zA-Z-]+\\.[a-z]+"
  λ> "my email is email@email.com" =~ emailRegex :: Bool
  >>> True

  -- non-monadic
  <to-match-against> =~ <regex>

  -- monadic, uses 'fail' on lack of match
  <to-match-against> =~~ <regex>
  ```

  `(=~)` and `(=~~)` are polymorphic in their return type. This is so that
  regex-tdfa can pick the most efficient way to give you your result based on
  what you need. For instance, if all you want is to check whether the regex
  matched or not, there's no need to allocate a result string. If you only want
  the first match, rather than all the matches, then the matching engine can stop
  after finding a single hit.

  This does mean, though, that you may sometimes have to explicitly specify the
  type you want, especially if you're trying things out at the REPL.

  ### Common use cases

  #### Get the first match

  ```haskell
  -- returns empty string if no match
  a =~ b :: String  -- or ByteString, or Text...

  λ> "alexis-de-tocqueville" =~ "[a-z]+" :: String
  >>> "alexis"

  λ> "alexis-de-tocqueville" =~ "[[:digit:]]+" :: String
  >>> ""
  ```

  #### Check if it matched at all

  ```haskell
  a =~ b :: Bool

  λ> "alexis-de-tocqueville" =~ "[a-z]+" :: Bool
  >>> True
  ```

  #### Get first match + text before/after

  ```haskell
  -- if no match, will just return whole
  -- string in the first element of the tuple
  a =~ b :: (String, String, String)

  λ> "alexis-de-tocqueville" =~ "de" :: (String, String, String)
  >>> ("alexis-", "de", "-tocqueville")

  λ> "alexis-de-tocqueville" =~ "kant" :: (String, String, String)
  >>> ("alexis-de-tocqueville", "", "")
  ```

  #### Get first match + submatches

  ```haskell
  -- same as above, but also returns a list of /just/ submatches
  -- submatch list is empty if regex doesn't match at all
  a =~ b :: (String, String, String, [String])

  λ> "div[attr=1234]" =~ "div\\[([a-z]+)=([^]]+)\\]"
       :: (String, String, String, [String])
  >>> ("", "div[attr=1234]", "", ["attr","1234"])
  ```

  #### Get all non-overlapping matches

  ```haskell
  -- can also return Data.Array instead of List
  getAllTextMatches (a =~ b) :: [String]

  λ> getAllTextMatches ("john anne yifan" =~ "[a-z]+") :: [String]
  >>> ["john","anne","yifan"]

  λ> getAllTextMatches ("0a0b0" =~ "0[[:lower:]]0") :: [String]
  >>> ["0a0"]
  ```
  Note that `"0b0"` is not included in the result since it overlaps with `"0a0"`.

  #### Special characters

  `regex-tdfa` only supports a small set of special characters and is much less
  featureful than some other regex engines you might be used to, such as PCRE.

  * ``\` `` &mdash; Match start of entire text (similar to `^` in other regex engines)
  * `\'` &mdash; Match end of entire text (similar to `$` in other regex engines)
  * `\<` &mdash; Match beginning of word
  * `\>` &mdash; Match end of word
  * `\b` &mdash; Match beginning or end of word
  * `\B` &mdash; Match neither beginning nor end of word

  While shorthands like `\d` (for digit) are not recognized, one can use the respective
  POSIX character class inside `[...]`.  E.g., `[[:digit:][:lower:]_]` is short for
  `[0-9a-z_]`.  The supported character classes are listed on
  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Regular_expression&oldid=1095256273#Character_classes)
  and defined in module
  [`TNFA`](https://github.com/haskell-hvr/regex-tdfa/blob/95d47cb982d2cf636b2cb6260a866f9907341c45/lib/Text/Regex/TDFA/TNFA.hs#L804-L816).

  Please also consult a variant of this documentation which is part of the
  [Text.Regex.TDFA haddock](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/regex-tdfa/docs/Text-Regex-TDFA.html),
  and the original documentation at the [Haskell wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/Regular_expressions#regex-tdfa).

  ### Less common stuff

  #### Get match indices

  ```haskell
  -- can also return Data.Array instead of List
  getAllMatches (a =~ b) :: [(Int, Int)]  -- (index, length)

  λ> getAllMatches ("john anne yifan" =~ "[a-z]+") :: [(Int, Int)]
  >>> [(0,4), (5,4), (10,5)]
  ``````

  #### Get submatch indices

  ```haskell
  -- match of __entire__ regex is first element, not first capture
  -- can also return Data.Array instead of List
  getAllSubmatches (a =~ b) :: [(Int, Int)]  -- (index, length)

  λ> getAllSubmatches ("div[attr=1234]" =~ "div\\[([a-z]+)=([^]]+)\\]")
       :: [(Int, Int)]
  >>> [(0,14), (4,4), (9,4)]
  ```

  ### Replacement

  `regex-tdfa` does not provide find-and-replace.

  ## Avoiding backslashes

  If you find yourself writing a lot of regexes, take a look at
  [raw-strings-qq](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/raw-strings-qq). It'll
  let you write regexes without needing to escape all your backslashes.

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes #-}

  import Text.RawString.QQ
  import Text.Regex.TDFA

  λ> "2 * (3 + 1) / 4" =~ [r|\([^)]+\)|] :: String
  >>> "(3 + 1)"
  ```

  ## Known bugs and infelicities

  * Regexes with large character classes combined with `{m,n}` are very slow and memory-hungry ([#3][]).

    > An example of such a regex is `^[\x0020-\xD7FF]{1,255}$`.

  * POSIX submatch semantics are broken in some rare cases ([#2][]).

  [#2]: https://github.com/haskell-hvr/regex-tdfa/issues/2
  [#3]: https://github.com/haskell-hvr/regex-tdfa/issues/3

  ## About this package

  This was inspired by the algorithm (and Master's thesis) behind the regular expression library known as [TRE or libtre](https://github.com/laurikari/tre/).  This was created by Ville Laurikari and tackled the difficult issue of efficient sub-match capture for POSIX regular expressions.

  By building on this thesis and adding a few more optimizations, regex-tdfa matching input text of length N should have O(N) runtime, and should have a maximum memory bounded by the pattern size that does not scale with N. It should do this while returning well defined (and correct) values for the parenthesized sub-matches.

  Regardless of performance, nearly every single OS and Libra for POSIX regular expressions has bugs in sub-matches.  This was detailed on the [Regex POSIX Haskell wiki page](https://wiki.haskell.org/Regex_Posix), and can be demonstrated with the [regex-posix-unittest](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/regex-posix-unittest) suite of checks.  Test [regex-tdfa-unittest](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/regex-tdfa-unittest) should show regex-tdfa passing these same checks.  I owe my understanding of the correct behvior and many of these unit tests to Glenn Fowler at AT&T ("An Interpretation of the POSIX regex Standard").

  ### Maintainance history

  The original Darcs repository was at [code.haskell.org](http://code.haskell.org/regex-tdfa/).
  For a while a fork was maintained by Roman Cheplyaka as
  [regex-tdfa-rc](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/regex-tdfa-rc).

  Then the repository moved to <https://github.com/ChrisKuklewicz/regex-tdfa>,
  which was primarily maintained by [Artyom (neongreen)](https://github.com/neongreen).

  Finally, maintainership was passed on again and the repository moved to its current location
  at <https://github.com/haskell-hvr/regex-tdfa>.
