changelog: |
  0.4
  ---
  * Reinstate Text and ByteString instances because some users require them.

  0.3.0.1
  -------
  * Add yes/no and y/n parsing to the Bool instance

  0.3
  ---
  * Remove Readable instances for ByteString and Text because they are probably
    not what the user wants and could cause compilation to succeed when you
    probably want to see an error.

  0.2.0.2
  -------
  * Fix fromBS for ByteString so it is a correct passthrough instead of doing
    encodeUtf8 . decodeUtf8 under the hood.

  0.2.0.1
  -------
  * Use decodeUtf8' so that we can catch character encoding exceptions and
    return mzero instead of generating an exception.

  Readable
  ========

  The Read type class is very useful for building data types from String
  representations.  But String has high overhead, so sometimes it isn't suitable
  for applications where space usage and performance are important.  This
  library provides a simpler version of Read's functionality for Text and UTF8
  encoded ByteStrings.
