  # reflex-gi-gtk

  This package provides the necessary plumbing to write reactive GUI
  applications using GTK3+ (based on
  [gi-gtk](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gi-gtk/)) and
  [reflex](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/reflex/).

  While this packes should make working with gi-gtk and reflex together
  much easier than using them together without any kind of glue code, it
  doesn't provide a lot of abstraction on top of either GTK or
  reflex. People familiar with both gi-gtk and reflex separately should
  have no trouble using reflex-gi-gtk successfully to build awesome
  applications.

  ## Installation

  The package can be compiled with [stack](https://haskellstack.org/)
  using the shipped `stack.yaml` as follows:

  ```Shell
  $ stack install
  ```

  The build process has mostly been tested using stack, but it should
  also work using [cabal-install](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) or
  other standard `Cabal`-based package managers.

  ## Quick start

  To start writing your reactive GUI application using reflex-gi-gtk, you will farst want to start the reactive part of your application using `runReflexGtk`, something like this:

  ```Haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings, OverloadedLabels, FlexibleContexts #-}

  import Control.Applicative (liftA2)
  import GI.Gtk hiding (main)
  import Reflex.GI.Gtk
  import System.Environment
  import System.Exit

  main :: IO ()
  main = do
    argv <- (:) <$> getProgName <*> getArgs
    Just gtkApplication <- applicationNew (Just "org.example.MyAwesomeApp") []
    rc <- runReflexGtk gtkApplication (Just argv) $ myReactiveCode gtkApplication
    case rc of
      0 -> exitSuccess
      n -> exitWith $ ExitFailure $ fromIntegral n
  ```

  Inside the call to `runReflexGtk` you can assume that GTK has been
  initialized and start creating GTK widgets:

  ```Haskell
  myReactiveCode :: (MonadReflexGtk t m) => Application -> m ()
  myReactiveCode gtkApplication = do
    window <- runGtk $ applicationWindowNew gtkApplication
    box <- runGtk $ boxNew OrientationVertical 0
    containerAdd window box
    input1 <- runGtk entryNew
    input2 <- runGtk entryNew
    output <- runGtk $ labelNew Nothing
    runGtk $ boxPackStart box input1 False False 0
    runGtk $ boxPackStart box input2 False False 0
    runGtk $ boxPackStart box output False False 0
  ```

  Note that we use `runGtk` to execute GTK functions instead of relying
  on `liftIO`. This is because GTK functions are required to be run with
  the correct thread local context. reflex-gi-gtk internally uses
  multiple threads in a way that makes it hard to predict in which
  thread a given piece of code will run. `runGtk` will ensure that the
  lifted `IO` action is always run in the appropriate threading context
  for GTK functions.

  You can also start obtaining reactive inputs from widget signals:

  ```Haskell
    text1 <- dynamicOnSignal "" input1 #changed $ \fire -> labelGetText input1 >>= fire
    text2 <- dynamicOnAttribute input2 #text
  ```

  This creates to `Dynamic`s containing texts. `text1` is constructed
  based on the `#changed` event of the first input `Entry` while `text2`
  is bound to the attribute `#text` of `input2`, but overall the effect
  will be the same. Both `text1` and `text2` will always contain the
  text entered into their respective input `Entry`.

  Once we have obtained reactive inputs, we can of course manipulate
  them just as any other reactive values:

  ```Haskell
    let combinedText = liftA2 (<>) text1 text2
  ```

  In the end, we can also render dynamic values to attributes of GTK
  widgets:

  ```Haskell
    sink output [#label :== combinedText]
  ```

  Don't forget to call `widgetShowAll` on your window at an appropriate
  time:

  ```Haskell
    _ <- gtkApplication `on` #activate $ widgetShowAll window
    pure ()
  ```

  When you compile and run your program above, you should see your two
  input boxes and the appropriate, dynamically updated output label.

  This is of course a very basic example. For more information you can
  look at a more elaborate example in the `example` directory or at the
  haddock documentation on hackage.
