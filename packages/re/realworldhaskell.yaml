  -----

  This is a _living_ version of the legendary Real World Haskell book by the
  Three Immortals.

  Their contribution to the Haskell ecosystem will forever remain unparalleled,
  not only with regard to writing this book, but also in the industrial
  application of the Haskell Programming Language -- breaking the boundaries that
  had largely come to be set in academia alone. Since then, the community has
  steadily been gathering to the point that now we have the Haskell Foundation to
  direct its progress.

  It is clear that The Three wanted to bring this phenomenal langauge to
  mainstream industry in order to save themselves (and the rest of the world) from
  the toil of working with non-functional programming languages.

  The Haskell ecosystem has come a long way since this book was published,
  and moreover, the onward march of our beloved Haskellers towards
  programming-language-nirvana is relentless. All are welcome to help this book
  keep up with the party!
