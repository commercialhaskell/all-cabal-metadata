  This package provides a version of "GHC.Records" as it will be after the implementation of
  [GHC proposal #42](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0042-record-set-field.rst), which reads:

  ```haskell
  -- | Constraint representing the fact that the field @x@ can be get and set on
  --   the record type @r@ and has field type @a@.
  class HasField x r a | x r -> a where
      -- | Function to get and set a field in a record.
      hasField :: r -> (a -> r, a)
  ```

  In GHC these will be magically solved, but this package doesn't provide that. This package does provide extra helper functions for working with the `HasField` type class.
