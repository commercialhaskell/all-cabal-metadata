  When judging student performance, it is useful to have both small, composable,
  quantitive judgements, and qualitative remarks. This makes both spreadsheets
  and mere text-files ill-suited for marking student work.  Although
  [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] can solve this problem to a great extent, it
  becomes a heavy tool in the light of having to mark hundreds of students in a
  distributed fashion. With org-mode, everything is in one file, while global,
  intra-student statistics are not needed until all the students have been fully
  marked.

  * Design Goals

    1. One human-readable/editable file per student.
    2. Export options to spreadsheet-formats.
    3. git-friendly file format.
    4. Synchronization options with Dropbox and/or Google Drive.

  Goal 4 is not necessarily related to remark, but is related to marking student
  work with external examiners, who are not always willing to use more explicit
  version-control systems, such as git.

  * Syntax

  A =.mrk= file is a list of judgements. A judgement is a header, with a title,
  set points, and maximum points, followed by some comments.
