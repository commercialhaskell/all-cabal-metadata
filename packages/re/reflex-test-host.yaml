description: "# reflex-test-host\n\nThis library contains functionality for writing
  unit tests for the \"model\" portion of your reflex-frp apps. Please see \"test/Reflex/Test/SimpleHostSpec.hs\"
  for basic usage example. You can find more usage examples in [this project](https://github.com/minimapletinytools/reflex-potatoes?files=1)
  and [this one](https://github.com/minimapletinytools/reflex-todo-undo-mvc-model).\n\nNote
  that `TriggerEvent` class constraint is not supported. It could be added with some
  effort but breaks the \"pureness\" of the test (at least from its inputs) so I don't
  suggest it. You can still test parts of your network that don't require `TriggerEvent`.\n\nThere
  is also a monadic testing module in this library. You can see usage examples in
  \"test/Reflex/Test/Monad/HostSpec.hs\". \n\nPRs are welcome. Perhaps you have some
  ideas to make the interface more useable.\n"
