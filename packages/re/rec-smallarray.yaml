  [![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/re-xyr/rec-smallarray/build)](https://github.com/re-xyr/rec-smallarray/actions/workflows/build.yaml)
  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/rec-smallarray)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rec-smallarray)

  An immutable extensible record type based on `SmallArray`s, intended to provide fast reads on small structures.

  ## Asymptotics

  - Index: Amorized `O(1)` with low constant factor
  - Update: `O(n)`
  - Slice: `O(1)`
  - Cons: `O(n)`

  Note that this structure slows down GC when its size exceeds 128.

  ## Contribution

  This library started out as a module in [`cleff`](https://github.com/re-xyr/cleff), an extensible effects library, and it needs to continue accommodating that. Contribution is welcome as long as it does not impede this library's performance nor increase its dependency footprint.
