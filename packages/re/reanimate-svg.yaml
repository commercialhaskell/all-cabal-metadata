   * Adding `Semigroup` instances for defined `Monoid`, for GHC 8.4

  v0.6.2.1 December 2017
   * Workaround/Fix: removed reliance on Template Haskell to derive lenses,
     by writing them directly in the file, using the ddump-splices. For some
     reason Haddock associated with GHC 8.2.2 was entering infinite loop on
     the Types file. Ugly workaround, but at least it works.

   * Fix: gather named elements even outside of <defs> tags.
   * Fix: URL ID now can contain more characters.

  v0.6.1: January 2017
   * Fix: some gradient mesh parsing, stop can have style (like with Inkscape 0.92)
   * Fix: norm say "<mesh>" is the global tag
   * Fix: Adding `xlink:href` attribute on patterns
   * Fix: Adding `patternTransform` attribute on patterns

   * Add SVG 2.0 gradient mesh

  v0.5.1.2: September 2016
   * Fix path parsing with white space prefix

  v0.5.1.1: May 2016
   * Fix: GHC 8.0 compatibility

  v0.5.1: March 2016
   * Fix: serialization of multi criteria css selector.

  v0.5: March 2016:
   * Adding: preserveAspectRatio attribute
   * Fix: Application of CSS rules with indirect parent/child relation.

  v0.4.2: March 2016
   * Enhancement: avoiding serializatinon of empty class attribute
   * Fix: incorrect deserialization of complex CSS
   * Fix: Really fixing duplicate ID with serialization

  v0.4.1: February 2016
   * Fix: fixing duplicate ID with serialization

  v0.4: February 2016
   * Breaking change: viewbox types are no longer Int
     but double, sneakingly passed in v0.3.2.2. This
     version acknoweledge this change

  V0.3.2.2 February 2016 (Deprecated)
   * Fix: Bad serialization of some None constructors.

  v0.3.2.1 October 2015

  v0.3.2 August 2015
   * Fix: allow compilation with GHC 7.4

  v0.3.1 May 2015
   * Fix: Bumping lens dependency and removing upper bound.

  v0.3 April 2015
   * Breaking change: Switching all the numeric types associated to geometry
     to Double precision (thx to Kasbah)

  v0.2 April 2015
   * Fix: Differentiating opacity & fill-opacity, as they are
     semantically deferent (BREAKING CHANGE!)

  v0.1.1 April 2015

  reanimate-svg provides types representing a SVG document,
  and allows to load and save it.

  The types definition are aimed at rendering,
  so they are rather comple. For simpler SVG document building,
  look after `lucid-svg`.
