  reddit for haskell [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/intolerable/reddit.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/intolerable/reddit)
  ---

  A Haskell library for interacting with the [Reddit API](http://reddit.com/api).

  A couple of examples
  ---

  Let's get all the posts from the frontpage of Reddit and write a summary of each of them to the console:

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
  import Reddit
  import Reddit.Types.Post

  import Control.Monad
  import Control.Monad.IO.Class
  import Data.Monoid
  import qualified Data.Text as Text
  import qualified Data.Text.IO as Text

  main = runRedditAnon $ do
    Listing _ _ posts <- getPosts
    forM_ posts $ \post -> do
      liftIO $ Text.putStrLn $
         "[" <> tshow (score post) <> "] " <>
         title post <> " (" <> tshow (subreddit post) <> ")"

  tshow = Text.pack . show
  ```

  Let's check to see which of a group of users has the highest link karma:

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
  import Reddit
  import Reddit.Types.User

  import Data.List
  import Data.Ord

  usersToCheck = ["nikita-volkov", "simonmar", "bos", "roche"]

  main = runRedditAnon $ do
    infos <- mapM (getUserInfo . Username) usersToCheck
    return $ maximumBy (comparing linkKarma) infos
  ```

  Testing
  ===

  Pure tests
  ---

  `cabal test test`

  This suite will only run test that don't require doing any IO. Helpful because it runs quickly and isn't subject to any network problems.

  Anonymous tests
  ---

  `cabal test test-anon`

  There's also a suite of tests that can be run anonymously without having to set up a user account and an empty subreddit.

  Full IO tests
  ---

  `cabal test test-io`

  The `test` test suite will run the tests that don't rely on doing any IO, but the `test-io` should be used too to ensure that IO functions do what they're supposed to do. If you want to run the IO suite, add a file `test_config.yaml` to the `reddit/` directory, like this:

  ```
  username: my_reddit_username
  password: my_reddit_password
  subreddit: test_subreddit # A subreddit that the user has moderator access to
  client_id: MY_CLIENT_ID # Your reddit app client ID
  client_secret: MY_CLIENT_SECRET # Your reddit app client secret
  ```

  Your app client and secret can be found in [your reddit preferences](https://reddit.com/prefs/apps/)
