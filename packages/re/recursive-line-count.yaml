description: |-
  This program can be used to count lines of code in a program and display
  them hierarchically.  For example, to tally up lines of Haskell code in a
  git repository:

  >git ls-files '*.hs' | recursive-line-count

  More precisely, @recursive-line-count@ takes a list of file names on
  standard input, counts lines in each file, and displays the results in a
  GtkTreeView.

  Note that although this package is BSD3-licensed, it has LGPL dependencies.
