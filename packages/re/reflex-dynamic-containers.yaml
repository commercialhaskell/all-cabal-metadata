  # reflex-dynamic-containers

  Dynamic containers for reflex.

  For usage examples, please see [todo-undo-mvc](https://github.com/pdlla/reflex-todo-undo-mvc-model).

  Containers in this library have multiple update events. If any of these fire simultaneously, they will put out an stdout warning via `traceEvent` and all but one of the events are ignored by `leftmost`. This will almost certainly result in undesirable behavior.

  PRs are very welcome.

  These containers were written for use in [potato-flow](https://github.com/pdlla/potato-flow) (very WIP).

  # TODOs
  - switch to cabal only for better compatibility with rest of reflex ecosystem
  - better documentation and examples
  - more testing
