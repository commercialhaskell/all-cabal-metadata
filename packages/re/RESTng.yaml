description: "RESTng: A framework for writing RESTful applications\n\nIt is experimental,
  incomplete and we are currently not actively developing it.\nAnyway, there are several
  interesting features so we have decided to release them to share the ideas.\n\n\nFeatures
  include:\n\n\nYahoo Grids:\nThe presentation uses the yuiGrid (grids defined by
  layout hints rendered with the yahoo grids).\n\n\nAnnotations: \nA resource can
  be annotated so that related information can be shown. The presentation of a resource
  to html is done by multiple annotations, each one possibly in different boxes with
  different layout hints.\n\n\nAssociations: \nResource collections \"has many\" associations
  can be defined allowing:\n\n  - Lookup functions in the Model for associated resources\n
  \ - Some annotations are available to be used like childComponent or parentComponent
  to list children resources or show the parent in separate boxes.\n  - Hierarchical
  URLs are automatically handled in the control part. i.e.: \n          GET http://site/book/3/chapter/1
  \   (get the chapter 1 of book with id 3)\n          GET http://site/book/3/chapter/new
  \ (get a form for filling data for the new chapter for book with id 3)\n          POST
  http://site/book/3/chapter/new (create a new chapter for the book with id 3)\n          and
  so on for updates, list and delete actions\n\n  - Polymorphic associations are supported
  (i.e.: comment associated to books and also associated to authors).\n\nORM:\nThe
  ORM generates tables in the DB from the Haskell record type. Existing tables and
  attributes are kept and missing attributes are added.\n\nOther features supported:
  \n  - Tags\n  - Ratings\n  - Comments\n  - Users and login\n  - CMS-like form fields
  validations.\n\n\nPlease send comments or questions to:\n - Tomas Nielsen <tanielsen@gmail.com>\n
  - Sergio Urinovsky <sergio.urinovsky@gmail.com>\n\n"
