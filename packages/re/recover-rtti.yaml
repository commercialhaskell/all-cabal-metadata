  # Revision history for recover-rtti

  ## 0.4.2 -- 2023-03-23

  * Support mtl 2.3 (requiring at least 2.3.1) (#26).
    Thanks to Rebecca Turner.

  ## 0.4.1 -- 2022-03-17

  * Support for ghc 9.2, bytestring 0.11, aeson 0.2
  * Added `traceAnything` and `traceAnythingId` (#13)
  * Added deriving-via support (`AnythingToString`, `BoxAnything`) (#3)

  ## 0.4 -- 2021-06-30

  * Correctly set some required lower bounds.
  * Add support for reclassification
  * Add classification equality check
  * Add support for primitive arrays and vectors
  * Fix classification on OSX
  * General internal cleanup of the library

  This release is backwards incompatible with 0.3, but users that simply use
  `anythingToString` should be unaffected.

  ## 0.3.0.0 -- 2021-03-17

  * Fix bug that could cause `anythingToString` to fail on lists with an
    `elemUserDefined` exception (issue #6). Thanks to Bit Connor for the report!

  ## 0.2.1.0 -- 2021-03-17

  * Add support for unordered-containers and boxed vectors.

  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2021-03-15

  * Reorganize module structure (primarily to improve Haddocks)

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2021-03-11

  * Alpha release

  # recover-rtti

  Recover run-time type information from the GHC heap. The key function in this
  library is

  ```haskell
  classify :: a -> Either Closure (Classifier a)
  ```

  which recovers type information about values about which we know nothing (in
  particular, no type class constraints). One example use case is the following
  `anythingToString` function:

  ```haskell
  anythingToString :: a -> String
  ```


  We test that the result of `anythingToString` is equal to the result of regular
  `show` for a large range of data types (including user-defined ones that the
  library is not aware of). There are also other possible use cases; for example,
  it should be possible to define an `anythingToJSON` function.

  Obviously there are limitations; the most important ones are:

  * `UNPACK`ed fields are invisible to the library. This does not need to be
    a major issue though, when compiling code with `-O0` fields are not unpacked.
    (https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/pragmas.html?highlight=unpack#nounpack-pragma)
  * Record field names are not known, and so records are shown just using the
    constructor.

  There may be other gotchas as well; this library is primarily intended
  for debugging.
