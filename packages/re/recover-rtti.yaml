  # recover-rtti

  Recover run-time type information from the GHC heap. The key function in this
  library is

  ```haskell
  classify :: a -> Classifier a
  ```

  which recovers type information about values about which we know nothing (in
  particular, no type class constraints). One example use case is the following
  `anythingToString` function:

  ```haskell
  anythingToString :: a -> String
  ```


  We test that the result of `anythingToString` is equal to the result of regular
  `show` for a large range of data types (including user-defined ones that the
  library is not aware of). There are also other possible use cases; for example,
  it should be possible to define an `anythingToJSON` function.

  Obviously there are limitations; the most important ones are:

  * `UNPACK`ed fields are invisible to the library. This does not need to be
    a major issue though, when compiling code with `-O0` fields are not unpacked.
    (https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/pragmas.html?highlight=unpack#nounpack-pragma)
  * Record field names are not known, and so records are shown just using the
    constructor.

  There may be other gotchas as well; this library is primarily intended
  for debugging.
