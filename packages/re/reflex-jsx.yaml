description: |-
  `reflex-jsx` is a library for writing jsx-like syntax in
  reflex code. This can be useful for situations where you
  have a large block of HTML with some styles, and it would
  be easier to read as actual HTML than various reflex
  functions.
  It's implemented as a "QuasiQuoter", so you just import the
  `jsx` function from ReflexJsx and generate the equivalent
  functions that would run inside of a "MonadWidget t m".
  Not only can you generate a block of static HTML/CSS, but you
  can also splice in your own nodes that implement
  "MonadWidget t m", string attribute values, or even entire
  dynamic attribute maps.
