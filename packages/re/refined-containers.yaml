description: |-
  This package defines ways to prove that a key exists in an associative
  container such as a 'Map', 'IntMap', or 'HashMap'; so that the key can be
  used to index into the map without a 'Maybe' or manually handling the
  \"impossible\" case with 'error' or other partial functions.

  To do this, the containers are tagged with a type parameter that identifies
  their set of keys, so that if you have another container with the same
  parameter, you know it has the same keys.

  There is also a type of keys that have been proven to exist in such
  containers -- a refinement type. They are also tagged with a type parameter.
  If the type parameter of the key matches that of the container, indexing is
  guaranteed to proceed without failure.
