  This is heavily inspired by Edward Kmett''s

  [recursion-schemes](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/recursion-schemes)

  library, and some code is drawn from it. As such, you will find it

  suitable most places that `recusion-schemes` is.


  It also provides monadic versions of several common recursion schemes.
