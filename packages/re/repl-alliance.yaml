      variable `GHCI_QUICKFIX_ENABLED=true`.


  ## Usage

  This plugin is intended to be used with GHCi or adjacent utilities such as
  `ghcid` and `ghciwatch` as a development tool, not as a package dependency.

  ### Stack Projects

  To use with a stack project (you may need to add `ghci-quickfix` to your
  `extra-deps` first):

  ```bash
  stack repl my-project --package repl-alliance --ghci-options='-fplugin ReplAlliance'
  ```

  ### Cabal Projects

  To use with a cabal project (you may need to run `cabal update` first):

  ```bash
  cabal repl my-project --build-depends repl-alliance --repl-options='-fplugin ReplAlliance'
  ```

  ## Compatibility

  All plugins included in `repl-alliance` aim to support the four latest major GHC releases.
