  # `redact-haskell` Changelog

  This project follows the [Haskell package versioning policy][PVP], with
  versions in `A.B.C.D` format.  `A` may be incremented arbitrarily for
  non-technical reasons, but [semantic versioning][SemVer] is otherwise
  followed, where `A.B` is the major version, `C` is the minor version, and `D`
  is the patch version.  Initial development uses versions `0.0.0.D`, for which
  every version is considered breaking.

  [PVP]: <https://pvp.haskell.org/>
  [SemVer]: <https://semver.org/>

  The format of this changelog is based on [Keep a Changelog][KaC], with the
  following conventions:

  * Level-two heading `Unreleased` is used to track changes that have not been
    released.
  * Other level-two headings specify the release in `A.B.C.D (YYYY-MM-DD)`
    format, with newer versions above older versions.
  * Level-three headings are used to categorize changes as follows:
      1. Breaking
      2. Non-Breaking
  * Changes are listed in arbitrary order and present tense.

  ## Overview

  Redact is a utility for hiding secret text on the terminal.

  It is designed to work with Markdown syntax.  Inline code (text enclosed in
  backticks) and code blocks that are fenced with backticks are hidden.  Note
  that inline code that spans multiple lines is not supported, and other types
  of code blocks are not hidden.

  Text is hidden by displaying it using the same color for the foreground and
  background.  When selecting hidden text, it remains hidden in some terminals
  and becomes visible in other terminals.

  Be sure to test it in your terminal before relying on it.

  ## CLI

  ### Requirements

  Redact has only been tested on Linux.  Testing on Windows 10 and macOS will
  be added in a future release.

  ### Installation

  #### `.deb` Package Installation

  Check the [Releases][] page for `.deb` packages.

  [Releases]: <https://github.com/ExtremaIS/redact-haskell/releases>

  #### `.rpm` Package Installation

  Check the [Releases][] page for `.rpm` packages.

  #### Installation From Hackage

  Install PhatSort from [Hackage][] using [Cabal][] as follows:

  ```
  $ cabal v2-install redact
  ```

  [Hackage]: <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/redact>
  [Cabal]: <https://www.haskell.org/cabal/>

  #### Installation From Stackage

  Install PhatSort from [Stackage][] using [Stack][] as follows:

  ```
  $ stack install redact
  ```

  [Stackage]: <https://www.stackage.org/package/redact>
  [Stack]: <https://haskellstack.org/>

  ### Usage

  See the [`redact` man page][] for usage information.

  [`redact` man page]: <doc/redact.1.md>

  ### Branches

  The `main` branch is reserved for releases.  It may be considered stable, and
  `HEAD` is always the latest release.

  The `develop` branch is the primary development branch.  It contains changes
  that have not yet been released, and it is not necessarily stable.

  [Hackage revisions][] are made for metadata changes, such as relaxation of
  constraints when new versions of dependencies are released.  The
  `redact.cabal` metadata in the `main` branch may therefore not match that of
  Hackage.  The `redact.cabal` metadata in the `develop` branch may match,
  *unless* work is being done on a new release that contains other changes.

  ### Tags

  All releases are tagged in the `main` branch.  Release tags are signed using
  the [`security@extrema.is` GPG key][].
