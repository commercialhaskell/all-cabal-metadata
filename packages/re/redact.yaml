  # `redact-haskell` Changelog

  This project follows the [Haskell package versioning policy][PVP], with
  versions in `A.B.C.D` format.  `A` may be incremented arbitrarily for
  non-technical reasons, but [semantic versioning][SemVer] is otherwise
  followed, where `A.B` is the major version, `C` is the minor version, and `D`
  is the patch version.  Initial development uses versions `0.0.0.D`, for which
  every version is considered breaking.

  [PVP]: <https://pvp.haskell.org/>
  [SemVer]: <https://semver.org/>

  The format of this changelog is based on [Keep a Changelog][KaC], with the
  following conventions:

  * Level-two heading `Unreleased` is used to track changes that have not been
    released.
  * Other level-two headings specify the release in `A.B.C.D (YYYY-MM-DD)`
    format, with newer versions above older versions.
  * Level-three headings are used to categorize changes as follows:
      1. Breaking
      2. Non-Breaking
  * Changes are listed in arbitrary order and present tense.

  ## Overview

  Redact is a utility for hiding secret text on the terminal.

  It is designed to work with Markdown syntax.  Inline code (text enclosed in
  backticks) and code blocks that are fenced with backticks are hidden.  Note
  that inline code that spans multiple lines is not supported, and other types
  of code blocks are not hidden.

  Text is hidden by displaying it using the same color for the foreground and
  background.  When selecting hidden text, it remains hidden in some terminals
  and becomes visible in other terminals.

  Be sure to test it in your terminal before relying on it.

  ## CLI
