synopsis: Representing common recursion patterns as higher-order functions
changelog: |2

  ## 5.2.2.1

  * Fix build issue regarding `Setup.hs`. See #120.

  ## 5.2.2
  * More Mendler-style recursion-schemes: `mpara`, `mzygo`, `mana`, `mapo`, and
    `mfutu`.
  * `makeBaseFunctor` no longer generates warnings when combined with
    DerivingStrategies.

  ## 5.2.1 [2020.10.04]
  * Allow building with `template-haskell-2.17.0.0` (GHC 9.0).

  ## 5.2

  * Add instances for `Tree` (from `containers`)
  * Add some haddocks and basic examples
  * Generalize the type of `makeBaseFunctor(With)`, such that
    it can take also `Dec`. This way you may supply context for `Recursive`
    and `Corecursive` instances.
  * Depend on `data-fix` package for fixed point types.

  ## 5.1.3 [2019.04.26]
  * Support `th-abstraction-0.3.0.0` or later.

  ## 5.1.2
  * Make the `Generic`-based instances to also support data constructors with zero
    arguments (and datatypes with zero constructors).

  ## 5.1.1.1

  * Invalid release

  ## 5.1.1

  * Add `cotransverse`
  * Add `Generic` based default implementation to `embed` and `project`.
    `Recursive` and `Corecursive` can be `DeriveAnyClass`-derived now,
    if you write the base functor by hand.

  ## 5.1
  * Export gfutu
  * `distGHisto`, `ghisto`, and `gchrono` now use `Cofree (Base t)`
  * `distGFutu`, `gfutu`, and `gchrono` now use `Free (Base t)`
  * Add `hoist`, `hoistMu` and `hoistNu`
  * Add `transverse` and `cataA`

  ## 5.0.3 [2018.07.01]
  * Make the Template Haskell machinery look through type synonyms.
  * Avoid incurring some dependencies when using recent GHCs.

  ## 5.0.2
  * Support GHC-8.2.1
  * Fix Template Haskell derivation with non-default type renamer.
  * Add `Recursive` and `Corecursive Natural` instances, with `Base Natural = Maybe`.

  ## 5.0.1
  * Add `Data.Functor.Foldable.TH` module, which provides derivation of base functors via Template Haskell.

  ## 5
  * Renamed `Foldable` to `Recursive` and `Unfoldable` to `Corecursive`. With `Foldable` in `Prelude` in GHC 7.10+, having a needlessly conflicting name seemed silly.
  * Add support for GHC-8.0.1
  * Use `Eq1`, `Ord1`, `Show1`, `Read1` to derive `Fix`, `Nu` and `Mu` `Eq`, `Ord` `Show` and `Read` instances
  * Remove `Prim` data family. `ListF` as a new name for `Prim [a]`, with plenty of instances, e.g. `Traversable`.
  * Export `unfix`
  * Add chronomorphisms: `chrono` and `gchrono`.
  * Add `distGApoT`

  ## 4.1.2
  * Support for `free` 4.12.1

  ## 4.1.1
  * Support for GHC 7.10
  * Fixed `para`.

  ## 4.1
  * Support for GHC 7.7+'s generalized `Typeable`.
  * Faster `gapo` and `para` by exploiting sharing.

  ## 4.0

  * Compatibility with `comonad` and `free` version 4.0

  ## 3.0

  * Compatibility with `transformers` 0.3
  * Resolved deprecation warnings caused by changes to `Data.Typeable`

  # recursion-schemes

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/recursion-schemes.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/recursion-schemes) [![Build Status](https://github.com/ekmett/recursion-schemes/workflows/Haskell-CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ekmett/recursion-schemes/actions?query=workflow%3AHaskell-CI)

  This package represents common recursion patterns as higher-order functions.

  ## A familiar example

  Here are two recursive functions.

  ```haskell
  sum :: [Int] -> Int
  sum [] = 0
  sum (x:xs) = x + sum xs

  product :: [Int] -> Int
  product [] = 1
  product (x:xs) = x * product xs
  ```

  These functions are very similar. In both cases, the empty list is the base case. In the cons case, each makes a recursive call on the tail of the list. Then, the head of the list is combined with the result using a binary function.

  We can abstract over those similarities using a higher-order function, [`foldr`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Data-List.html#v:foldr):

  ```haskell
  sum     = foldr (+) 0
  product = foldr (*) 1
  ```

  ## Other recursive types

  `foldr` works great for lists. The higher-order functions provided by this library help with other recursive datatypes. Here are two recursive functions on [`Tree`s](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers/docs/Data-Tree.html#t:Tree):

  ```haskell
  depth :: Tree a -> Int
  depth (Node _ subTrees) = 1 + maximum subTrees

  size :: Tree a -> Int
  size (Node _ subTrees) = 1 + sum subTrees
  ```

  It is not possible to use `foldr` to simplify `depth`. Conceptually, `foldr` is flattening all the elements of the tree into a list before combining them with the binary function. This does not work for `depth` because it needs to examine the structure of the tree, which `foldr` flattened away.

  We can instead use one of the higher-order functions provided by this library, [`cata`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/recursion-schemes/docs/Data-Functor-Foldable.html#v:cata).

  ```haskell
  import Data.Functor.Base (TreeF(..))
  import Data.Functor.Foldable

  -- data Tree  a   = Node  a [Tree a]
  -- data TreeF a r = NodeF a [r     ]

  depth :: Tree a -> Int
  depth = cata go
    where
      go :: TreeF a Int -> Int
      go (NodeF _ subDepths) = 1 + maximum subDepths

  size :: Tree a -> Int
  size = cata go
    where
      go :: TreeF a Int -> Int
      go (NodeF _ subSizes) = 1 + sum subSizes
  ```

  In this example, the code is a bit longer, but it is correct. Did you spot the mistake in the version which does not use `cata`? We forgot a call to `fmap`:

  ```haskell
  depth :: Tree a -> Int
  depth (Node _ subTrees) = 1 + maximum (fmap depth subTrees)

  size :: Tree a -> Int
  size (Node _ subTrees) = 1 + sum (fmap size subTrees)
  ```

  `cata` automatically adds this call to `fmap`. This is why `subDepths` contains a list of already-computed depths, not a list of sub-trees. In general, each recursive position is replaced by the result of a recursive call. These results have type `Int`, not type `Tree`, so we need a helper datatype `TreeF` to collect these results.

  When you think about computing the depth, you probably think "it's 1 plus the maximum of the sub-depths". With `cata`, this is exactly what we write. By contrast, without `cata`, we need to describe both the "how" and the "what" in our implementation. The "how" is about recurring over the sub-trees (using `fmap depth`), while the "what" is about adding 1 to the maximum of the sub-trees. `cata` takes care of the recursion, so you can focus solely on the "what".

  A **recursion-scheme** is a function like `cata` which implements a common recursion pattern. It is a higher-order recursive function which takes a non-recursive function as an argument. That non-recursive function describes the part which is unique to your calculation: the "what".

  ## Types with many constructors

  Let's look at a more complex example. Here is a small lambda-calculus and a function to compute the [free variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Free_variables) of an expression:

  ```haskell
  import Data.Set (Set)
  import qualified Data.Set as Set

  data Expr
    = Var String
    | Lam String Expr
    | App Expr Expr
    | Constant Int
    | Add Expr Expr
    | Sub Expr Expr
    | Mul Expr Expr
    | Div Expr Expr
    | ...

  freeVars :: Expr -> Set String
  freeVars (Var name)      = Set.singleton name
  freeVars (Lam name body) = Set.difference (freeVars body) (Set.singleton name)
  freeVars (App e1 e2)     = Set.union (freeVars e1) (freeVars e2)
  freeVars (Constant _)    = Set.empty
  freeVars (Add e1 e2)     = Set.union (freeVars e1) (freeVars e2)
  freeVars (Sub e1 e2)     = Set.union (freeVars e1) (freeVars e2)
  freeVars (Mul e1 e2)     = Set.union (freeVars e1) (freeVars e2)
  freeVars (Div e1 e2)     = Set.union (freeVars e1) (freeVars e2)
  freeVars ...
  ```

  As you can see, we had to repeat the `Set.union (freeVars e1) (freeVars e2)` line over and over. With recursion-schemes, this code becomes much shorter:

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE DeriveFunctor, DeriveFoldable, DeriveTraversable, TemplateHaskell, TypeFamilies #-}
  import Data.Functor.Foldable.TH (makeBaseFunctor)

  makeBaseFunctor ''Expr

  freeVars :: Expr -> Set String
  freeVars = cata go
    where
      go :: ExprF (Set String) -> Set String
      go (VarF name)           = Set.singleton name
      go (LamF name bodyNames) = Set.difference bodyNames (Set.singleton name)
      go fNames                = foldr Set.union Set.empty fNames
  ```

  The `makeBaseFunctor` line uses Template Haskell to generate our `ExprF` datatype, a single layer of the `Expr` datatype. `makeBaseFunctor` also generates instances which are useful when using recursion-schemes. For example, we make use of the `Foldable ExprF` instance on the last line of `go`. This `Foldable` instance exists because `ExprF` has kind `* -> *`, while `Expr` has kind `*`.

  ## Other recursion-schemes

  All of our examples so far have used `cata`. There are many more recursion-schemes. Here is an example which follows a different recursive structure:

  ```haskell
  -- |
  -- >>> halves 256
  -- [256,128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1]
  halves :: Int -> [Int]
  halves 0 = []
  halves n = n : halves (n `div` 2)
  ```

  That recursive structure is captured by the [`ana`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/recursion-schemes/docs/Data-Functor-Foldable.html#v:ana) recursion-scheme:

  ```haskell
  halves :: Int -> [Int]
  halves = ana go
    where
      go :: Int -> ListF Int Int
      go 0 = Nil
      go n = Cons n (n `div` 2)
  ```

  The [Data.Functor.Foldable](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/recursion-schemes/docs/Data-Functor-Foldable.html) module provides many more.
