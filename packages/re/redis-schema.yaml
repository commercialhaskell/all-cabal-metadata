  ## Why `redis-schema`

  ### Statically typed schema

  #### Hedis

  The most common Redis library seems to be
  [Hedis](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedis), and `redis-schema` builds
  on top of it. However, consider the type of `get` in Hedis:

  ```haskell
  get
      :: (RedisCtx m f)
      => ByteString -- ^ key
      -> m (f (Maybe ByteString))
  ```

  For most use cases, it would be nice if:
  * the value could be decoded from a `ByteString` automatically
    * provides convenience but also type safety
  * the key could imply the type of the value
    * provides type safety
    * guides programmer, documents structures, etc. -- everything we love about static types
    * it's also immediately clear which instance to use for decoding

  #### `redis-schema`

  In `redis-schema`, the type of `get` is:
  ```haskell
  get :: Ref ref => ref -> RedisM (RefInstance ref) (Maybe (ValueType ref))
  ```
  and it makes use of user-supplied declarations:
  ```haskell
  data NumberOfVisitors = NumberOfVisitors Date

  instance Ref NumberOfVisitors where
    type ValueType NumberOfVisitors = Integer
    toIdentifier (NumberOfVisitors date) =
      SviTopLevel $ Redis.colonSep ["number-of-visitors", BS.pack (show date)]
  ```

  The differences are:
  * Instead of `ByteStrings`, `redis-schema` uses references that are usually
    bespoke ADTs, such as `NumberOfVisitors`.
  * Bespoke reference types eliminate string operations scattered across the code:
    you write `get (NumberOfVisitors today)` instead of
    `get ("number-of-visitors:" <> BS.pack (show today))`.
    `ByteString` concatenation of course needs to be done somewhere
    but it's implemented only once: in the `toIdentifier` method.
  * References are more abstract than bytestring keys, which improves composability.
    For example, meta-records [use this abstractness](#aside-references),
    as a meta-record consists of multiple Redis keys, and thus there's no single bytestring
    that could reasonably identify it.
  * The `Ref` instance of that data type determines that
    the reference stores `Integer`s. This can be seen
    in the associated type family `ValueType`.

  More complex data structures, like records, work similarly.

  ### Composability

  A major goal of `redis-schema` is to provide typed primitives,
  on top of which one can safely and conveniently build further typed libraries,
  such as [`Database.Redis.Schema.Lock`](#locks)
  or [`Database.Redis.Schema.RemoteJob`](#remote-jobs).
  [Meta-records](#meta-records) are another example of how low-level
  primitives compose into higher-level "primitives" of the same kind.

  The focus at composability is reflected in the design decisions of various typeclasses,
  and in the design and use of Redis transactions to ensure that
  composability is not broken by race conditions.

  ## Tutorial by example

  Imagine you want to use Redis to count the number of the visitors
  on your website. This is how you would do it with `redis-schema`.

  ### Simple variables

  (For demonstration purposes, the following example also includes some
  basic operations you might *not* do while counting visitors, too. :) )

  ```haskell
  -- This module is generally intended to be imported qualified.
  import qualified Database.Redis.Schema as Redis

  -- The type of references to the number of visitors.
  -- Since we want only one number of visitors, this type is a singleton.
  -- Later on, we'll see more interesting types of references.
  data NumberOfVisitors = NumberOfVisitors

  -- We define that NumberOfVisitors is indeed a Redis reference.
  instance Redis.Ref NumberOfVisitors where
    -- The type of the value that NumberOfVisitors refers to is Int.
    type ValueType NumberOfVisitors = Int

    -- The location of the value that NumberOfVisitors refers to is "visitors:number".
    toIdentifier NumberOfVisitors = "visitors:number"

  f :: Redis.Pool -> IO ()
  f pool = Redis.run pool $ do
    -- write to the reference
    set NumberOfVisitors 42
    setTTL NumberOfVisitors (24 * Redis.hour)

    -- atomically increment the number of visitors
    incrementBy NumberOfVisitors 1

    -- atomically read and clear (zero) the reference
    -- useful for transactional moves of data
    n2 <- take NumberOfVisitors
    liftIO $ print n2

    -- read the value of the reference
    n <- get NumberOfVisitors
    liftIO $ print n  -- this prints "Just 0", assuming no writes from other threads
  ```

  ### Parameterised references

  If you want a separate counter for every day,
  you define a slightly more interesting reference type.

  ```haskell
  -- Note that the type constructor is still nullary (no parameters)
  -- but the data constructor takes the 'Date' in question.
  data DailyVisitors = DailyVisitors Date

  instance Redis.Ref DailyVisitors where
    -- Again, the reference points to an 'Int'.
    -- We're talking about the type of the reference so no date is present here.
    type ValueType DailyVisitors = Int

    -- The location does depend on the value of the reference,
    -- so it can depend on the date. We include the date in the Redis path.
    toIdentifier (DailyVisitors date) =
      Redis.colonSep ["visitors", "daily", ByteString.pack (show date)]

  f :: Redis.Pool -> Date -> IO ()
  f pool today = Redis.run pool $ do
    -- atomically bump the number of visitors
    incrementBy (DailyVisitors today) 1

    -- (other threads may modify the value here)

    -- read and print the reference
    n <- get (DailyVisitors today)
    liftIO $ print n
  ```

  With composite keys, it's sometimes useful to use `Redis.colonSep`,
  which builds a single colon-separated `ByteString` from the provided components.

  ### Lists, Sets, Hashes, etc.

  What we've read/written so far were `SimpleValue`s: data items that can be
  encoded as `ByteString`s and used without restrictions.
  However, Redis also provides richer data structures, including lists, sets,
  and maps/hashes.

  The advantage is that Redis provides operations to manipulate these data
  structures directly. You can insert elements, delete elements, etc., without
  reading a `ByteString`-encoded structure and writing its modified version back.

  The disadvantage is that Redis does not support nesting them.

  That does not mean there's absolutely no way to put sets in sets --
  if you encode the inner sets into ByteString, you can nest them however you want.
  However, you will not be able to use native Redis functions like `sInsert` or `sDelete`
  to modify the inner sets; you'd have to read, modify, and write back the entire inner value to do it
  -- and that, besides being inconvenient and inefficient,
  [cannot be done atomically in Redis](#transactions).

  This is reflected in `redis-schema` by the fact that
  the `SimpleValue` instance is not defined for `Set a`, `Map k v` and `[a]`,
  which prevents nesting them directly.

  On the other hand, `redis-schema` defines additional functions
  specific to these data structures, such as the above mentioned
  `sInsert`, which is used to insert elements into a Redis set.

  ```haskell
  -- The set of visitor IDs for the given date.
  data DailyVisitorSet = DailyVisitorSet Date

  instance Redis.Ref DailyVisitorSet where
    -- This reference points to a set of visitor IDs.
    type ValueType DailyVisitorSet = Set VisitorId

    -- The Redis location of the value.
    toIdentifier (DailyVisitorSet date) =
      Redis.colonSep ["visitor_set", "daily", ByteString.pack (show date)]

  f :: Redis.Pool -> Date -> VisitorId -> IO ()
  f pool today vid = Redis.run pool $ do
    -- insert the visitor ID
    sInsert (DailyVisitorSet today) vid

    -- get the size of the updated set
    -- (and print it)
    liftIO . print =<< sSize (DailyVisitorSet today)

    -- atomically get and clear the visitor set
    -- (and print it)
    liftIO . print =<< take (DailyVisitorSet today)
  ```

  There is a number of functions available for these structures,
  refer to the reference documentation / source code for a complete list.

  Also, we add functions when we need them, so it's quite possible that the function
  that you require has not been added yet. Pull requests are welcome.

  ### Hashes

  There is a special operator `(:/)` to access the items of a hash,
  as if they were individual Redis `Ref`s.
  Here's our running example with website visitors,
  except that now instead of just the count of visits, or just the set of visitors,
  we will store exactly how many times each visitor has visited us.

  ```haskell
  data Visitors = Visitors Date

  instance Redis.Ref Visitors where
    -- Each daily visitor structure is a map from visitor ID to the number of visits.
    type ValueType Visitors = Map VisitorId Int

    toIdentifier (Visitors date) =
      Redis.colonSep ["visitors", ByteString.pack (show date)]

  f :: Redis.Pool -> Date -> VisitorId -> IO ()
  f pool today visitorId = do
    -- increment one specific counter inside the hash
    incrementBy (Visitors today :/ visitorId) 1

    -- print all visitors
    allVisitors <- get (Visitors today)
    print allVisitors
  ```

  Using operator `(:/)`, we could write `Visitors today :/ visitorId`
  to reference a single field of a hash. However, we can also
  retrieve and print the whole hash if we choose to.

  #### Aside: Hashes vs. composite keys

  In the previous example, the reference `Visitors date`
  points to a `Map VisitorId Int`. This is one realisation of a mapping
  `(Date, VisitorId) -> Int` but not the only possible one.
  Another way would be including the `VisitorId` in the key like this:

  ```haskell
  data VisitCount = VisitCount Date VisitorId

  instance Redis.Ref VisitCount where
    type ValueType VisitCount = Int

    toIdentifier (VisitCount date visitorId) =
      Redis.colonSep
        [ "visitors"
        , ByteString.pack (show date)
        , ByteString.pack (show visitorId)
        ]
  ```

  This way, every date-visitor combination gets its own full key-value entry
  in Redis. There are advantages and disadvantages to either representation.

  * With hashes, you also implicitly get a list of visitor IDs for each day.
    With composite keys, you have to use the `SCAN` or `KEYS` Redis command.

  * It's easy to `get`, `set` or `take` whole hashes (atomically).
    With separate keys, you have to use an explicit transaction,
    and code up these operations manually.

  * Hashes take less space than the same number of values in separate keys.

  * You cannot set the TTL of items in a hash separately: only the whole hash has a TTL.
    With separate keys, you can set TTL individually.

  * You cannot have complex data types (Redis sets, Redis hashes, etc.)
    nested inside hashes without encoding them as `ByteString`s first.
    (See [Lists, sets, hashes, etc.](#lists-sets-hashes-etc))
    There are no such restrictions for separate keys.

  Hence the encoding depends on your use case. If you're caching
  a set of related things for a certain visitor, which you want to read as a whole
  and expire as a whole, it makes sense to put them in a hash.

  If your items are rather separate, you want to expire them separately,
  or you want to store structures like hashes inside,
  you have to put them in separate keys.
  Fields like `date` should probably generally go in the (possibly composite) key
  because they will likely affect the required expiration time.

  ### Records

  We have just seen how to use Redis hashes to store values of type `Map k v`.
  The number of items in the map is unlimited
  but all keys and values must have the same type.

  There's another (major) use case for Redis hashes: records.
  Records are structures which contain a fixed number of named values,
  where each value can have a different type.
  It is therefore a natural way of clustering related data together.

  Here's an example showing how records are modelled in `redis-schema`.

  ```haskell
  -- First, we use GADTs to describe the available fields and their types.
  -- Here, 'Email' has type 'Text', 'DateOfBirth' has type 'Date',
  -- and 'Visits' and 'Clicks' have type 'Int'.
  data VisitorField :: * -> * where
    Email :: VisitorField Text
    DateOfBirth :: VisitorField Date
    Visits :: VisitorField Int
    Clicks :: VisitorField Int

  -- We define how to translate record keys to strings
  -- that will be used to key the Redis hash.
  instance Redis.RecordField VisitorField where
    rfToBS Email = "email"
    rfToBS DateOfBirth = "date-of-birth"
    rfToBS Visits = "visits"
    rfToBS Clicks = "clicks"

  -- Then we define the type of references pointing to the visitor statistics
  -- for any given visitor ID.
  data VisitorStats = VisitorStats VisitorId

  -- Finally, we declare that the type of references is indeed a Redis reference.
  instance Redis.Ref VisitorStats where
    -- The type pointed to is 'Redis.Record VisitorField', which means
    -- a record with the fields defined by 'VisitorField'.
    type ValueType VisitorStats = Redis.Record VisitorField

    -- As usual, this defines what key in Redis this reference points to.
    toIdentifier (VisitorStats visitorId) =
      Redis.colonSep ["visitors", "statistics", Redis.toBS visitorId]
  ```

  This example is a bit silly because if you know `DateOfBirth` about your unregistered visitors,
  there's something very wrong. However, for demonstrational purposes, it'll suffice.

  Now we can get references to the individual fields with the specialised operator `:.`.

  ```haskell
  handleClick :: VisitorId -> Redis ()
  handleClick visitorId = do
    -- for demonstration purposes, log the email
    email <- Redis.get (VisitorStats visitorId :. Email)
    liftIO $ print email

    -- atomically increase the counter of clicks
    Redis.incrementBy (VisitorStats visitorId :. Clicks) 1
  ```

  In the current implementation, `Record`s cannot be read or written as a whole.
  (However, they *can* be deleted and their TTL can be set.)
  There is no special reason for that, except that it would be too much type-level code
  that we currently do not need, so we keep it simple.

  However, see [Meta-records](#meta-records) for the next best solution.

  #### Aside: non-fixed record fields

  The number of fields in a record is not *really* fixed.
  Consider the following declaration.

  ```haskell
  data VisitorField :: * -> * where
    Visits :: Date -> VisitorField Int

  instance Redis.RecordField VisitorField where
    rfToBS (Visits date) = Redis.colonSep ["visits", Redis.toBS date]
  ```

  This creates a record with a separate field for every date:

  ```haskell
  handleVisit :: VisitorId -> Date -> Redis ()
  handleVisit visitorId today = do
    Redis.incrementBy (VisitorStats visitorId :. Visits today) 1
  ```

  ### Transactions

  Redis does support transactions and `redis-schema` supports them,
  but they are not like SQL transactions, which you may be accustomed to.
  A more suggestive name for Redis transactions might be
  "[mostly](#errors-in-transactions) atomic operation batches".

  The main difference between SQL-like transactions and batched Redis transactions
  is that in SQL, you can start a transaction, run a query, receive its output,
  and then run another query in the same transaction. Sending queries and receiving their outputs
  can be interleaved in the same transaction, and later queries can depend on the output
  of previous queries, while the database takes care of the ACIDity of the transaction.

  With Redis-style batched transactions, on the other hand, you can batch up
  multiple operations but the atomicity of a transaction ends at the moment you
  receive the output of those operations. Anything you do with the output is not
  enclosed in that transaction anymore, and other clients could have modified the
  data in the meantime. In other words, later operations in a batched transaction
  cannot depend on the output of the previous operations, as that output is not
  available yet.

  While the structure of SQL-like transactions is captured by the `Monad` typeclass,
  Redis-style fixed-effects transactions are described by `Applicative` functors --
  and this is exactly the interface that `redis-schema` provides for Redis transactions.

  #### The `Tx` functor

  `redis-schema` defines the `Tx` functor for transactional computations.

  ```haskell
  newtype Tx inst a
  instance Functor (Tx inst)
  instance Applicative (Tx inst)
  instance Alternative (Tx inst)

  atomically :: Tx inst a -> RedisM inst a
  txThrow :: RedisException -> Tx inst a
  ```

  The type parameter `inst` is explained in section [Redis instances](#redis-instances),
  but can be ignored for now.

  Redis transactions are run using the combinator called `atomically`.
  A failing operation (or using `txThrow`)
  in a transaction [will not prevent any other side effects from taking place](#errors-in-transactions);
  only the exception will be re-thrown in the `RedisM` monad
  instead of returning the output of the transaction. The `Alternative` instance
  of `Tx` can be used to address exceptions.

  #### Working with transactions

  Most functions, like `get`, `set` or `take`,
  have a sibling that can be used in a transaction, usually prefixed with `tx`:

  ```haskell
  get   :: Ref ref => ref -> RedisM (RefInstance ref) (Maybe (ValueType ref))
  txGet :: Ref ref => ref -> Tx     (RefInstance ref) (Maybe (ValueType ref))
  ```

  With `ApplicativeDo`, these transactional functions can be used as conveniently
  as their non-transactional counterparts. For example, the function `take`,
  which atomically reads and deletes a Redis value, could be (re-)implemented as follows:

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE ApplicativeDo #-}

  take :: Ref ref => ref -> RedisM (RefInstance ref) (Maybe (ValueType ref))
  take ref = atomically $ do
    value <- txGet ref
    txDelete_ ref
    pure value
  ```

  #### What Redis transactions cannot do

  One might try to attempt an alternative implementation of `txIncrementBy`:

  ```haskell
  import Data.Maybe (fromMaybe)

  txIncrementBy' :: (SimpleRef ref, Num (ValueType ref))
    => ref -> Integer -> Tx (RefInstance ref) (ValueType ref)
  txIncrementBy' ref incr = do
    oldValue <- fromMaybe 0 <$> txGet ref        -- COMPILER ERROR
    let newValue = oldValue + fromInteger incr
    txSet ref newValue
    pure newValue
  ```

  The compiler complains
  ```
  • Could not deduce (Monad (Tx (RefInstance ref)))
      arising from a do statement
  ```
  because `oldValue` is used non-trivially in the `do` block,
  but `Tx` implements only `Applicative` and not `Monad`.

  This error is exactly a goal of the design: it indicates at compile time
  that Redis does not support this usage pattern.

  #### Errors in transactions

  Beware that Redis won't roll back failed transactions, which means they
  are not atomic in that sense, and may be carried out incompletely.
  A Redis transaction that fails in the middle
  will keep going and retain all effects except for any failed operations.
  See [the Redis documentation](https://redis.io/docs/manual/transactions/#errors-inside-a-transaction)
  for details and rationale.

  #### Monads vs applicative functors

  The underlying library of `redis-schema`, Hedis, provides a monad `RedisTx`
  to describe Redis transactions. Since monads would be too powerful, Hedis uses
  an opaque wrapper for `Queued` results to prevent the users from accessing
  values that are not available yet. We believe that using an applicative functor
  instead is a perfect match for this use case: it allows exactly the right
  operations, and all wrapping/unwrapping can be done entirely transparently.
  `Tx` also propagates exceptions from transactions transparently.

  ### Exceptions

  The type of exceptions in `redis-schema` is `RedisException`,
  and they are thrown using `throwIO` under the hood.
  These arise mostly from internal error conditions, such as
  connection errors, decoding errors, etc.,
  but library users can nevertheless still throw them manually
  using `throw :: RedisException -> RedisM inst a`.

  Unlike `hedis`, `redis-schema` does support throwing exceptions
  in transactions. Exceptions do *not* abort transactions
  -- all effects of a transaction will persist even if an exception has been thrown --
  but `RedisException`s thrown using `txThrow` are transparently propagated out of the transaction
  and thrown at the `RedisM` level instead of returning the result of the transaction.

  ### Custom data types

  Every type that can be stored in Redis using `redis-schema`
  comes with a `Value` instance that describes how to read, write, and perform
  other operations on values of that type in Redis.

  There are two kinds of Redis `Value`s: simple values and non-simple values.
  Simple values are those that encode/decode to/from a `ByteString`, and thus
  have no restrictions on how they can be used in Redis.
  They can be stored in top-level keys, as well as in Redis lists,
  Redis sets, Redis hashes, etc. Simple values include
  integers, floats, text, bytestrings, etc.

  Non-simple values are all values that are more complicated than a bytestring,
  and thus will come with restrictions. For example, Redis lists are not simple values.

  Let's start by discussing simple values.

  #### Simple values

  The easiest case of declaring Redis instances for custom data types
  are newtypes of types that already have Redis instances. For example,
  if your user IDs are textual but you would still like to keep them apart
  from other `Text` data, you could use the following declarations.

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE DerivingStrategies #-}

  newtype UserId = UserId Text
    deriving newtype (Redis.Serializable)

  instance Redis.Value inst UserId
  instance Redis.SimpleValue inst UserId
  ```

  Thanks to `deriving newtype`, we did not have to write
  any wrapping/unwrapping boilerplate, and thanks to
  the default implementations of `Value` methods,
  we did not have to write those, either.

  The class `SimpleValue` does not have any methods, and it mostly
  only stands for the list of constraints in its declaration
  (primarily, for the `Serializable` constraint).
  `SimpleValue` is a typeclass rather than a constraint alias
  because you may want to have a `Serializable` instance for
  a non-simple `Value`. Thus a `SimpleValue` instance also represents
  the intentional declaration that the type in question should be regarded
  as a simple value.

  For other types, we need to supply a `Serializable` instance,
  which is, however, often not too hard.

  ```haskell
  data Color = Red | Green | Blue

  instance Redis.Serializable Color where
    fromBS = Redis.readBS
    toBS   = Redis.showBS

  -- Convenience functions available:
  -- Redis.readBS :: Read val => ByteString -> Maybe val
  -- Redis.showBS :: Show val => val -> ByteString

  instance Redis.Value inst Color
  instance Redis.SimpleValue inst Color
  ```

  The typeclass `Serializable` is separate from `Show`, `Read`, and `Binary` because:
  * `Show` and `Read` quote strings, and we need the ability to avoid doing it
  * `Binary` does not produce human-readable output and would thus affect the usability of tools like `redis-cli`

  Since `redis-schema` is intended to be imported qualified as `Redis`,
  `Redis.Serializable` is an accurate name for the typeclass.

  #### Non-simple values

  Non-simple values have instances only for `Value`.
  The default implementations of methods of `Value` require a `SimpleValue` instance,
  thus relieving us from defining them whenever a `SimpleValue` instance exists.
  For non-simple values, we have to implement the methods of `Value` manually.

  Not all methods of `Value` may make sense for all data types,
  or not all methods may be practically implementable.
  In such cases, it's acceptable to fill the definition with an `error` message.

  For example, the `Record` type defined by `redis-schema` does not support
  reading/writing whole records because that would require more type-level
  machinery than we needed at the time.

  Another example is the fact that `setTTL` does not make (a lot of)
  sense for values represented by `SviHash`,
  i.e. for values that exist inside a Redis hash, as TTL can be set only for the whole hash.
  Pragmatically, `redis-schema` resorts to silently changing the TTL for the whole hash.

  Yet another example are the `PubSub` channels,
  where the operations of `get` and `set` do not make sense.

  In all these cases, the "correct" solution would be splitting the `Value`
  typeclass into smaller classes per supported feature so that the availability
  of the individual operations is declared at the type level. We decided to keep
  things simple (if perhaps a bit crude) and use a single `Value` typeclass. This
  may be revisited in the future.

  #### Redis instances

  In section [Simple Variables](#simple-variables), we have seen that
  a `Redis.Ref` determines a "path to a variable" in Redis.
  But what if you run more Redis servers? You might want that to use different
  key eviction policies and different memory limits for different purposes.

  The definition of `Redis.Ref` includes an extra associated type family
  called `RefInstance`, which identifies the server, representing the hitherto
  missing part of the "path to the variable". This type family has a default
  value `DefaultInstance`, which is why we have not needed to deal with it so far.
  Here's what it looks like:

  ```haskell
  -- | The kind of Redis instances. Ideally, this would be a user-defined DataKind,
  --   but since Haskell does not have implicit arguments,
  --   that would require that we index everything with it explicitly,
  --   which would create a lot of syntactic noise.
  --
  --   (Ab)using the * kind for instances is a compromise.
  type Instance = *

  -- | We also define a default instance.
  --   This is convenient for code bases using only one Redis instance,
  --   since 'RefInstance' defaults to this. (See the 'Ref' typeclass below.)
  data DefaultInstance

  -- | The Redis monad related to the default instance.
  type Redis = RedisM DefaultInstance

  class Value (RefInstance ref) (ValueType ref) => Ref ref where
    -- | Type of the value that this ref points to.
    type ValueType ref :: *

    -- | RedisM instance this ref points into, with a default.
    type RefInstance ref :: Instance
    type RefInstance ref = DefaultInstance

    -- | How to convert the ref to an identifier that its value accepts.
    toIdentifier :: ref -> Identifier (ValueType ref)
  ```

  A Redis instance can be added by declaring an empty tag type,
  for example as follows:

  ```haskell
  -- For data that should not get lost
  type InstReliable = Redis.DefaultInstance

  -- For throwaway data to speed things up
  data InstCacheLRU
  ```

  Then a `Redis.Ref` can be placed in the appropriate Redis instance:
  ```haskell
  data VisitorCount = VisitorCount

  instance Redis.Ref VisitorCount where
    type ValueType VisitorCount = Integer
    type RefInstance VisitorCount = InstReliable  -- reliable
    toIdentifier VisitorCount = "visitor_count"


  data CachedFile = CachedFile FilePath

  instance Redis.Ref CachedFile where
    type ValueType CachedFile = ByteString
    type RefInstance CachedFile = InstCacheLRU  -- evicted as necessary
    toIdentifier (CachedFile path) = Redis.colonSep ["cached_files", BS.pack path]
  ```

  Finally, all connections and the Redis monad are tagged
  by the Redis instance, best illustrated by this type signature:

  ```haskell
  run :: MonadIO m => Pool inst -> RedisM inst a -> m a
  ```

  There are two consequences.
  First, all operations in a `RedisM` computation must work with the same instance.
  Second, it is practical to have a wrapper function around `run` that automatically
  selects the right connection `Pool` from the environment, based on the Redis instance
  specified in the type of the `RedisM` computation.

  ### Meta-records

  In Haskell, records can be nested arbitrarily. You can have a record
  that contains some fields alongside another couple of records,
  which themselves contain arbitrarily nested maps and lists of further records.

  Redis does not support such arbitrary nesting while being able to
  access and manipulate the inner structures like you would a top-level one
  (e.g. increment a counter deep in the structure).
  However, we can often work around this limitation
  by distributing the datastructure over a number of separate Redis keys.
  For example, consider a case where each visitor should be associated with
  the number of visits, the number of clicks, and the set of their favourite songs.
  Here we can keep the visits+clicks in one record reference per visitor, and the set of favourites
  in another reference, again per visitor.
  However, we still need to read the visits+clicks separately from the favourites.
  This is not just an impediment to convenience: two separate reads may lead to a race condition,
  unless we run them in a transaction.

  Since `redis-schema` encourages compositionality, it is possible to make data structures
  that gather (or scatter) all their data across Redis automatically, without having
  to manipulate every component separately every time. Here's an example.

  ```haskell
  -- VisitorFields are visits and clicks.
  data VisitorField :: * -> * where
    Visits :: VisitorField Int
    Clicks :: VisitorField Int

  -- VisitorStats is a record with VisitorFields
  data VisitorStats = VisitorStats VisitorId
  instance Redis.Ref VisitorStats where
    type ValueType VisitorStats = Redis.Record VisitorField
    toIdentifier = {- ...omitted... -}

  -- A separate reference to the favourite songs.
  data FavouriteSongs = FavouriteSongs VisitorId
  instance Redis.Ref FavouriteSongs where
    type ValueType FavouriteSongs = Set SongId
    toIdentifier = {- ...omitted... -}

  -- Finally, here's our composite record that we want to read/write atomically.
  data VisitorInfo = VisitorInfo
    { viVisits :: Int
    , viClicks :: Int
    , viFavouriteSongs :: Set SongId
    }

  instance Redis.Value Redis.DefaultInstance VisitorInfo where
    type Identifier VisitorInfo = VisitorId

    txValGet visitorId = do
      visits <- fromMaybe 0 <$> Redis.txGet (VisitorStats visitorId :. Visits)
      clicks <- fromMaybe 0 <$> Redis.txGet (VisitorStats visitorId :. Clicks)
      favourites <- fromMaybe Set.empty <$> Redis.txGet (FavouriteSongs visitorId)
      return $ Just VisitorInfo
        { viVisits = visits
        , viClicks = clicks
        , viFavourites = favourites
        }

    txValSet visitorId vi = do
      Redis.txSet (VisitorStats visitorId :. Visits) (viVisits vi)
      Redis.txSet (VisitorStats visitorId :. Clicks) (viClicks vi)
      Redis.txSet (FavouriteSongs visitorId) (viFavourites vi)

    txValDelete visitorId = do
      Redis.txDelete (VisitorStats visitorId)
      Redis.txDelete (FavouriteSongs visitorId)

    {- etc. -}
  ```

  It's a bit of a boilerplate, but now all the scatter/gather code is packed
  in the `Value` instance, it's safe and it composes. Moreover, using `let`-bound
  shorthand functions for common expressions, the repetition can be greatly minimised.

  #### Aside: references

  A reference to `VisitorInfo` would look as follows.
  ```haskell
  data VisitorInfoRef = VisitorInfoFor VisitorId

  instance Redis.Ref VisitorInfoRef where
    type ValueType VisitorInfoRef = VisitorInfo
    toIdentifier (VisitorInfoFor visitorId) = visitorId
  ```

  Meta-records demonstrate why reference ADTs are more flexible than bytestring keys.
  Since `VisitorInfo` is identified by `VisitorId`, as determined by the associated
  type family `Identifier`, it would be impractical to extract `VisitorId`
  from a `ByteString` reference.

  More fundamentally, a meta-record is not associated with any single
  key in Redis so there is no bytestring key to speak of -- and that's why
  we used `VisitorId` to identify the meta-record above instead.

  We *could* approach the bytestring as the prefix of all keys that constitute the meta-record
  but that's less flexible than the ADT approach, which lets us extract
  the components of the key and rearrange them as we see fit.
  The optimal arrangement of data in Redis may not coincide with a single
  fixed bytestring key prefix.

  #### Aside: instances

  Looking back at this instance head:
  ```haskell
  instance Redis.Value Redis.DefaultInstance VisitorInfo where
  ```
  We see that unlike in the usual case, this `Value` instance has been declared specifically
  for `DefaultInstance`. The reason is that the definition of the `Value` instance
  for `VisitorInfo` accesses Redis refs `VisitorStats` and `FavouriteSongs`,
  and these refs are linked to `DefaultInstance`.

  Since every Redis `Ref` must be linked to a specific Redis instance, and cannot be polymorphic
  in the instance (its purpose is to give a path to the variable, as discussed),
  all meta-records that access them under the hood must be declared for that particular instance.
  Consequently, all `Ref`s that make up a meta-record must be linked to the same Redis instance.

  ## Libraries

  ### Locks

  Locks are implemented in `Database.Redis.Schema.Lock`.
  The basic type is the exclusive lock; the shared lock is implemented using an exclusive lock.
  Hence the shared lock is also slower, and it's sometimes better to use an exclusive lock,
  even though a shared lock would be sufficient.

  The library does not export much API; the main points of interest
  are functions `withExclusiveLock` and `withShareableLock`, which bracket
  a synchronised operation.
  ```haskell
  withExclusiveLock ::
    ( MonadCatch m, MonadThrow m, MonadMask m, MonadIO m
    , Redis.Ref ref, Redis.ValueType ref ~ ExclusiveLock
    )
    => Redis.Pool (Redis.RefInstance ref)
    -> LockParams  -- ^ Params of the lock, such as timeouts or TTL.
    -> ref         -- ^ Lock ref
    -> m a         -- ^ The action to perform under lock
    -> m a
  ```

  Another purpose of `Database.Redis.Schema.Lock` is to demonstrate
  how a library can be implemented on top of `Database.Redis.Schema`.

  ### Remote jobs

  Sadly, this library has not been published yet.
  We'd like to, though.

  ## Future work

  * Reading numeric types in Redis never returns `Nothing`; they'll return `Just 0` instead.
    Perhaps the return types could reflect that somehow.

  * Different Redis `Value`s sometimes support different operations, as briefly discussed
    at [non-simple values](#non-simple-values). We may want to split `Value` into multiple
    type classes, depending on the supported operations.

  * [Records](#records) cannot be read/written as a whole.
    The only reason is that we did not need it,
    and thus opted to avoid all the type-level machinery
    coming with extensible records.
    However, adopting an established library like `vinyl`
    as an optional dependency might be worth it.
