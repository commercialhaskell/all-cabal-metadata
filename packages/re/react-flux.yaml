description: ! 'A GHCJS binding to [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) based
  on the

  [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) design.  The flux design pushes state and
  complicated logic

  out of the view, allowing the rendering functions and event handlers to be pure
  Haskell functions.

  When combined with React''s composable components and the one-way flow of data,
  React, Flux, and

  GHCJS work very well together.


  # Docs


  The [haddocks](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/react-flux) contain the documentation.


  # Build


  This package requires GHC 7.10 (I am using GHC 7.10.2) and the improved-base branch
  of ghcjs.

  I followed the instructions in the [ghcjs wiki](https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs/wiki/GHCJS-with-GHC-7.10)

  to install the improved-base branch.  Once ghcjs is installed, I use the following
  to build react-flux:


  ~~~

  echo "compiler: ghcjs" > cabal.config

  cabal configure

  cabal build

  ~~~


  # TODO Example Application


  The source contains an [example TODO

  application](https://bitbucket.org/wuzzeb/react-flux/src/tip/example/).


  ~~~

  cabal configure -fexample

  cabal build

  cd example

  make

  firefox todo.html

  ~~~


  If you don''t have closure installed, you can open `example/todo-dev.html`.


  # Test Suite


  To run the test suite, first you must build both the example application and the
  test-client.  (The

  test-client is a react-flux application which contains everything not contained
  in the todo

  example.)


  ~~~

  echo "compiler: ghcjs" > cabal.config

  cabal configure -fexample -ftest-client

  cabal build

  cd example

  make

  ~~~


  The above builds the TODO application, compresses it with closure, and builds the
  test client.

  Next, install [selenium-server-standalone](http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/)
  (also from

  [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-server-standalone-jar)).  Then, build
  the

  [hspec-webdriver](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hspec-webdriver) test suite
  using GHC (not

  GHCJS).  I use stack for this, although you can use cabal too if you like.


  ~~~

  cd test/spec

  stack build

  ~~~


  Finally, start selenium-server-standalone and execute the test suite.  It must be
  started from the

  `test/spec` directory, otherwise it does not find the correct javascript files.

  # Other Projects


  It differes significantly from the other two react bindings,

  [react-haskell](https://github.com/joelburget/react-haskell) and

  [ghcjs-react](https://github.com/fpco/ghcjs-react).  In particular, the major difference
  is how

  events are handled.  In the Flux design, the state is moved out out of the view
  and then handlers

  produce actions which transform the state.  Thus there is a one-way flow of data
  from the store into

  the view.  In contrast, react-haskell and ghcjs-react both have event signals propagaing
  up the

  react component tree, transforming state at each node.  In particular, react-haskell
  with its InSig

  and OutSig have the signals propagate up the tree and optionally transform state
  at each node and

  change the type of the signal.
