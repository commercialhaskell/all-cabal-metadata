description: |
  The reactive-fieldtrip library [1] connects reactive [2] (a functional
  reactive programming library) and FieldTrip [3] (a functional 3D library).
  It's a simple extension of reactive-glut [4].

  Please share any comments & suggestions on the discussion (talk) page at
  [1].

  You can configure, build, and install all in the usual way with Cabal
  commands.

    runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
    runhaskell Setup.lhs build
    runhaskell Setup.lhs install
