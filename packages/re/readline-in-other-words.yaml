  This package provides a few [in-other-words](https://github.com/KingoftheHomeless/in-other-words#readme) effects that collectively provide the full functionality of [haskeline](https://github.com/judah/haskeline#readme). See Haskeline's documentation for additional usage information.

  ## Example Usage
  This is all it takes to write a miniature repl using this library:
  ```
  {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-}

  module Main where

  import Control.Effect
  import Control.Effect.Readline

  repl :: Effs '[Readline, HandleInterrupt] m => m ()
  repl = handleInterrupt (outputStrLn "Interrupt!" *> repl) $
    withInterrupt $ do
      mline <- getInputLine "> "
      case mline of
        Nothing -> pure ()
        Just line -> outputStrLn line *> repl

  main :: IO ()
  main = runM $ runReadline defaultSettings repl
  ```

  This will echo whatever text you write, and catches interrupts announcing that
  they occurred and preventing the program from terminating. This example is also
  available as the `echo-repl` target in `examples/Echo.hs`.
