changelog: |
  ## Req 2.1.0

  * Dropped support for GHC 7.10.

  * Added the new `acceptHeader` method to the `HttpResponse` type class.
    Notably, the `jsonResponse` method now sets `"Accept"` header to
    `"application/json"`.

  ## Req 2.0.1

  * Fixed the `httpbin` tests (they changed something on the server again).

  ## Req 2.0.0

  * Got rid of `data-default-class` dependency, now we export
    `defaultHttpConfig` instead.

  ## Req 1.2.1

  * Fixed a typo in the type signature of `parseUrl`.

  ## Req 1.2.0

  * Added the `parseUrl` function.

  ## Req 1.1.0

  * Added `customAuth` and `attachHeader` to facilitate creation of custom
    authentication options.

  * Added `basicProxyAuth` authentication option.

  ## Req 1.0.0

  * Added the `reqBr` function allowing to consume `Response BodyReader`
    without using a pre-defined instance of `HttpResponse`, in a custom way.

  * Now streaming of response body does not happen until we've checked headers
    and status code with `httpConfigCheckResponse`. It also doesn't happen on
    every retry. Streaming and obtaining of final response value happens only
    once when we're happy with everything.

    Previously we first tried to consume and interpret response body before
    checking status code and determining whether we should retry the request.
    This was not good, because we could expect a JSON response but get a
    response with status code 500, and then still we would try to parse it as
    JSON first before letting `httpConfigCheckResponse` throw an exception.

    The corrected behavior should also make retrying more efficient.

  * Changed signatures of several fields of `HttpConfig`:
    `httpConfigCheckResponse`, `httpConfigRetryPolicy`, and
    `httpConfigRetryJudge` in order to eliminate redundant `IO` and prevent
    the possibility that these functions could start consuming `BodyReader`.

  * Removed the `makeResponsePreview` method from the `HttpResponse` type
    class. Preview business is handled by the library automatically on a lower
    level now. Users do not need to concern themselves with such stuff.

  * Changed the type signature of the `getHttpResponse` method of the
    `HttpResponse` type class. Previously it left too much freedom (and
    responsibility) to implementers of the method. In fact, we now limit what
    `getHttpResponse` does to just consuming and interpreting `Response
    BodyReader`, so we can properly control details of connection
    opening/closing etc., for the user.

  * Dropped support for GHC 7.8.

  * Minor documentation improvements.

  ## Req 0.5.0

  * Changed the signature of the `makeResponseBodyPreview` from `response ->
    IO ByteString` to `response -> ByteString`.

  * Minor documentation improvements.

  ## Req 0.4.0

  * Added the `Req` monad and `runReq` function to run it. This allows to use
    `req` without defining new (orphan) instances.

  ## Req 0.3.1

  * Added `basicAuthUnsafe`.

  ## Req 0.3.0

  * Made URL parsing functions `parseUrlHttp` and `parseUrlHttps` recognize
    port numbers.

  * Added `req'` function that allows to perform requests via a callback that
    receives pre-constructed request and manager.

  * Removed the `ReturnRequest` HTTP response implementation as it was not
    quite safe and was not going to work with retrying. Use `req'` instead for
    “pure” testing.

  * Changed the type of `httpConfigCheckResponse`, so the second argument can
    be any instance of `HttpResponse`.

  * Added built-in automatic retrying. See `httpConfigRetryPolicy` and
    `httpConfigRetryJudge` in `HttpConfig`. The default configuration retries
    5 times on request timeouts.

  * Added the `makeResponseBodyPreview` method to the `HttpResponse` type
    class that allows to specify how to build a “preview” of response body for
    inclusion into exceptions.

  * Improved wording in the documentation and `README.md`.

  ## Req 0.2.0

  * Added support for multipart form data in the form of `ReqBodyMultipart`
    body option and `reqBodyMultipart` helper function. This also required a
    change in the type signature of `getRequestContentType`, which now takes
    `body`, not `Proxy body` because we need to extract boundary from `body`
    and put it into `Content-Type` header. This change, however, shouldn't be
    too dangerous for end-users.

  * Added support for OAuth 1.0 authentication via `oAuth1` option.

  ## Req 0.1.0

  * Initial release.

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

  module Main (main) where

  import Control.Monad.IO.Class
  import Data.Aeson
  import Network.HTTP.Req

  main :: IO ()
  -- You can either make your monad an instance of 'MonadHttp', or use
  -- 'runReq' in any IO-enabled monad without defining new instances.
  main = runReq defaultHttpConfig $ do
    let payload = object
          [ "foo" .= (10 :: Int)
          , "bar" .= (20 :: Int) ]
    -- One function—full power and flexibility, automatic retrying on timeouts
    -- and such, automatic connection sharing.
    r <- req POST -- method
      (https "httpbin.org" /: "post") -- safe by construction URL
      (ReqBodyJson payload) -- use built-in options or add your own
      jsonResponse -- specify how to interpret response
      mempty       -- query params, headers, explicit port number, etc.
    liftIO $ print (responseBody r :: Value)
  ```

  Req is an easy-to-use, type-safe, expandable, high-level HTTP client library
  that just works without any fooling around.

  What does the phrase “easy-to-use” mean? It means that the library is
  designed to be beginner-friendly so it's simple to add to your monad stack,
  intuitive to work with, well-documented, and does not get in your way. Doing
  HTTP requests is a common task and Haskell library for this should be very
  approachable and clear to beginners, thus certain compromises were made. For
  example, one cannot currently modify `ManagerSettings` of the default
  manager because the library always uses the same implicit global manager for
  simplicity and maximal connection sharing. There is a way to use your own
  manager with different settings, but it requires a bit more typing.

  “Type-safe” means that the library is protective and eliminates certain
  classes of errors. For example, we have correct-by-construction URLs, it's
  guaranteed that the user does not send the request body when using methods
  like GET or OPTIONS, and the amount of implicit assumptions is minimized by
  making the user specify his/her intentions in an explicit form (for example,
  it's not possible to avoid specifying the body or method of request).
  Authentication methods that assume HTTPS force the user to use HTTPS at the
  type level. The library also carefully hides underlying types from the
  lower-level `http-client` package because those types are not safe enough
  (for example `Request` is an instance of `IsString` and, if it's malformed,
  it will blow up at run-time).

  “Expandable” refers to the ability to create new components for dealing with
  HTTP without having to resort to ugly hacking. For example, it's possible to
  define your own HTTP methods, create new ways to construct the body of a
  request, create new authorization options, perform a request in a different
  way, and create your own methods to parse and represent a response. As the
  user extends the library to satisfy his/her special needs, the new solutions
  will work just like the built-ins. However, all of the common cases are also
  covered by the library out-of-the-box.

  “High-level” means that there are less details to worry about. The library
  is a result of my experiences as a Haskell consultant. Working for several
  clients, who had very different projects, showed me that the library should
  adapt easily to any particular style of writing Haskell applications. For
  example, some people prefer throwing exceptions, while others are concerned
  with purity. Just define `handleHttpException` accordingly when making your
  monad instance of `MonadHttp` and it will play together seamlessly. Finally,
  the library cuts down boilerplate considerably, and helps you write concise,
  easy to read, and maintainable code.

  The library uses the following mature packages under the hood to guarantee
  you the best experience:

  * [`http-client`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-client)—low level
    HTTP client used everywhere in Haskell.
  * [`http-client-tls`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-client-tls)—TLS
    (HTTPS) support for `http-client`.

  It's important to note that since we leverage well-known libraries that the
  whole Haskell ecosystem uses, there is no risk in using Req. The machinery
  for performing requests is the same as with `http-conduit` and Wreq. The
  only difference is the API.

  ## Motivation and Req vs other libraries

  *This section is my opinion and it contains criticisms of other well-known
  libraries. If you're user/fan of one of these libraries, please remember not
  to react aggressively and respect the fact that I may have different views
  on API design from yours.*

  I have spent time to write the library because sending HTTP requests is such
  a common thing and still there is no high-level library for that in Haskell
  that I could use with pleasure. I'll explain why.

  First of all, there is `http-client` and `http-client-tls`. They just work.
  I have no issues with the libraries except that they are too low-level for
  my taste. Indeed, even the docs say that they are low-level and “intended as
  a base layer for more user-friendly packages”. This is exactly how I use
  them in Req, as base level. Req is nothing but a different API to
  `http-client`, so it only works because of the hard work put into
  `http-client`.

  `http-conduit` definitely has its place. For one thing it allows you to
  stream request and response bodies in constant memory, what other library
  allows you to do that? On the other hand if you take a look at
  `Network.HTTP.Simple`, then although it's said that it's a “higher level
  API”, it's mostly the same as vanilla `http-client` in spirit/approach and
  just adds `conduit`-powered functions to perform requests and allows to use
  global implicit `Manager` (Req does the same). If I tried to frame what
  exactly I don't like about `http-conduit` in words, then it would be “the
  way requests are constructed”. You set, set, set instead of *being forced*
  to declare necessary bits and *being allowed* to declare optional bits in a
  way that their combination is certainly valid. Also, with `http-conduit` you
  parse request from a string without the protection of TH that otherwise
  saves the day as in Yesod.

  Then there is Wreq. `wreq` [doesn't see much development
  lately](https://github.com/bos/wreq/issues/93). `wreq` is by itself a weird
  library, IMO. You have functions per method—not very good, as there may be
  new methods, like PATCH which is not new but still missing (well, you have
  `customMethod`, but what is the point of having per-method functions if you
  have a more general way to use any method? you should be able to just insert
  methods in the “argument slot” of `customMethod` and end up with a more
  general solution). Now, every method function has a companion that takes
  `Options` (like you have `get` and `getWith`). Why the duplication? Where is
  generality and flexibility? This is not all though, because you cannot
  really use `get` you see in the main module, because you want to have
  connection sharing. Wreq's author does not take the gift of automatic
  connection re-use `Manager` from `http-client` provides, he invents the
  whole new thing of “sessions”. Only inside a session your connections will
  be shared and re-used. However with the session stuff you have yet another
  set of per-method functions like `get` and `getWith`—these are different
  ones, to be used with sessions! Now if you have a multi-threaded app, here
  is a surprise for you: you can't share connections between threads as
  connections are shared only inside of the `withSession` friend and “session
  will no longer be valid after that function returns”. There are valid uses
  for sessions, but the point is that they are just too inconvenient for
  common tasks.

  It's funny that one client I worked for had to invent his own little wrapper
  around `http-client` just because he could not possibly use `wreq` and
  `http-client` and friends were too low-level. The previous paragraph is
  extracted from a talk with a Haskell developer who works for that client. I
  thought to myself “something is wrong with HTTP client libraries in Haskell
  if they had to make a wrapper”.

  What else? I used `servant-client` a couple of times but the amount of
  boilerplate it requires is frightening. If you have several query
  parameters, and you use just one of them, good luck passing lots of
  `Nothing`s.

  ## Unsolved problems

  AWS request signing is problematic because request body can be in the form
  of an action to execute (and all that “popper” stuff for streaming), not
  just a `ByteString` and so getting its digest (hash) is not trivial without
  running the action and consuming body in its entirety before the request in
  made. In Wreq the author chose to just use `error` when body is not a
  (strict or lazy) `ByteString`. Maybe it's OK for Wreq, but I don't consider
  this a proper solution for Req as we support full variety of body options.
  For example, what if I want to upload 1 Gb file to S3? I want to stream it
  in constant memory but at the same time I need to calculate its hash before
  I start streaming. One solution to the problem seems to be in taking the
  hash explicitly (as an argument of the hypothetical `awsAuth`) and making it
  a responsibility of the user to calculate the hash correctly. I don't like
  this because it's not user-friendly. So the question stays open, for now
  there is no AWS signing functionality provided out-of-the-box. The best
  solution for talking to AWS is the `amazonka` package so far.

  ## Related packages

  The following packages are designed to be used with Req:

  * [`req-conduit`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/req-conduit)—support
    for streaming request and response bodies in constant memory.

  If you happen to have written a package that adds new features to Req,
  please submit a PR to include it in this list.
