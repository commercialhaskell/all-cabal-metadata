changelog: ! "## Req 1.2.1\n\n* Fixed a typo in the type signature of `parseUrl`.\n\n##
  Req 1.2.0\n\n* Added the `parseUrl` function.\n\n## Req 1.1.0\n\n* Added `customAuth`
  and `attachHeader` to facilitate creation of custom\n  authentication options.\n\n*
  Added `basicProxyAuth` authentication option.\n\n## Req 1.0.0\n\n* Added the `reqBr`
  function allowing to consume `Response BodyReader`\n  without using a pre-defined
  instance of `HttpResponse`, in a custom way.\n\n* Now streaming of response body
  does not happen until we've checked headers\n  and status code with `httpConfigCheckResponse`.
  It also doesn't happen on\n  every retry. Streaming and obtaining of final response
  value happens only\n  once when we're happy with everything.\n\n  Previously we
  first tried to consume and interpret response body before\n  checking status code
  and determining whether we should retry the request.\n  This was not good, because
  we could expect a JSON response but get a\n  response with status code 500, and
  then still we would try to parse it as\n  JSON first before letting `httpConfigCheckResponse`
  throw an exception.\n\n  The corrected behavior should also make retrying more efficient.\n\n*
  Changed signatures of several fields of `HttpConfig`:\n  `httpConfigCheckResponse`,
  `httpConfigRetryPolicy`, and\n  `httpConfigRetryJudge` in order to eliminate redundant
  `IO` and prevent\n  the possibility that these functions could start consuming `BodyReader`.\n\n*
  Removed the `makeResponsePreview` method from the `HttpResponse` type\n  class.
  Preview business is handled by the library automatically on a lower\n  level now.
  Users do not need to concern themselves with such stuff.\n\n* Changed the type signature
  of the `getHttpResponse` method of the\n  `HttpResponse` type class. Previously
  it left too much freedom (and\n  responsibility) to implementers of the method.
  In fact, we now limit what\n  `getHttpResponse` does to just consuming and interpreting
  `Response\n  BodyReader`, so we can properly control details of connection\n  opening/closing
  etc., for the user.\n\n* Dropped support for GHC 7.8.\n\n* Minor documentation improvements.\n\n##
  Req 0.5.0\n\n* Changed the signature of the `makeResponseBodyPreview` from `response
  ->\n  IO ByteString` to `response -> ByteString`.\n\n* Minor documentation improvements.\n\n##
  Req 0.4.0\n\n* Added the `Req` monad and `runReq` function to run it. This allows
  to use\n  `req` without defining new (orphan) instances.\n\n## Req 0.3.1\n\n* Added
  `basicAuthUnsafe`.\n\n## Req 0.3.0\n\n* Made URL parsing functions `parseUrlHttp`
  and `parseUrlHttps` recognize\n  port numbers.\n\n* Added `req'` function that allows
  to perform requests via a callback that\n  receives pre-constructed request and
  manager.\n\n* Removed the `ReturnRequest` HTTP response implementation as it was
  not\n  quite safe and was not going to work with retrying. Use `req'` instead for\n
  \ “pure” testing.\n\n* Changed the type of `httpConfigCheckResponse`, so the second
  argument can\n  be any instance of `HttpResponse`.\n\n* Added built-in automatic
  retrying. See `httpConfigRetryPolicy` and\n  `httpConfigRetryJudge` in `HttpConfig`.
  The default configuration retries\n  5 times on request timeouts.\n\n* Added the
  `makeResponseBodyPreview` method to the `HttpResponse` type\n  class that allows
  to specify how to build a “preview” of response body for\n  inclusion into exceptions.\n\n*
  Improved wording in the documentation and `README.md`.\n\n## Req 0.2.0\n\n* Added
  support for multipart form data in the form of `ReqBodyMultipart`\n  body option
  and `reqBodyMultipart` helper function. This also required a\n  change in the type
  signature of `getRequestContentType`, which now takes\n  `body`, not `Proxy body`
  because we need to extract boundary from `body`\n  and put it into `Content-Type`
  header. This change, however, shouldn't be\n  too dangerous for end-users.\n\n*
  Added support for OAuth 1.0 authentication via `oAuth1` option.\n\n## Req 0.1.0\n\n*
  Initial release.\n"

  expandable, high-level HTTP client library\nthat just works without any fooling
  around.\n\nWhat does the phrase “easy-to-use” mean? It means that the library is\ndesigned
  to be beginner-friendly so it's simple to add to your monad stack,\nintuitive to
  work with, well-documented, and does not get in your way. Doing\nHTTP requests is
  a common task and a Haskell library for this should be very\napproachable and clear
  to beginners, thus certain compromises were made. For\nexample, one cannot currently
  modify `ManagerSettings` of the default\nmanager because the library always uses
  the same implicit global manager for\nsimplicity and maximal connection sharing.
  There is a way to use your own\nmanager with different settings, but it requires
  a bit more typing.\n\n“Type-safe” means that the library is protective and eliminates
  certain\nclasses of errors. For example, we have correct-by-construction URLs, it's\nguaranteed
  that the user does not send the request body when using methods\nlike GET or OPTIONS,
  and the amount of implicit assumptions is minimized by\nmaking the user specify
  his/her intentions in an explicit form (for example,\nit's not possible to avoid
  specifying the body or method of a request).\nAuthentication methods that assume
  HTTPS force the user to use HTTPS at the\ntype level. The library also carefully
  hides underlying types from the\nlower-level `http-client` package because those
  types are not safe enough\n(for example `Request` is an instance of `IsString` and,
  if it's malformed,\nit will blow up at run-time).\n\n“Expandable” refers to the
  ability to create new components for dealing with\nHTTP without having to resort
  to ugly hacking. For example, it's possible to\ndefine your own HTTP methods, create
  new ways to construct the body of a\nrequest, create new authorization options,
  perform a request in a different\nway, and create your own methods to parse and
  represent a response. As a\nuser extends the library to satisfy his/her special
  needs, the new solutions\nwill work just like the built-ins. However, all of the
  common cases are also\ncovered by the library out-of-the-box.\n\n“High-level” means
  that there are less details to worry about. The library\nis a result of my experiences
  as a Haskell consultant. Working for several\nclients, who had very different projects,
  showed me that the library should\nadapt easily to any particular style of writing
  Haskell applications. For\nexample, some people prefer throwing exceptions, while
  others are concerned\nwith purity. Just define `handleHttpException` accordingly
  when making your\nmonad instance of `MonadHttp` and it will play together seamlessly.
  Finally,\nthe library cuts boilerplate down considerably, and helps you write concise,\neasy
  to read, and maintainable code.\n\nThe library uses the following mature packages
  under the hood to guarantee\nyou the best experience:\n\n* [`http-client`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-client)—low
  level\n  HTTP client used everywhere in Haskell.\n* [`http-client-tls`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-client-tls)—TLS\n
  \ (HTTPS) support for `http-client`.\n\nIt's important to note that since we leverage
  well-known libraries that the\nwhole Haskell ecosystem uses, there is no risk in
  using Req. The machinery\nfor performing requests is the same as with `http-conduit`
  and Wreq. The\nonly difference is the API.\n\n## Motivation and Req vs other libraries\n\n*This
  section is my opinion and it contains criticisms of other well-known\nlibraries.
  If you're user/fan of one of these libraries, please remember not\nto react aggressively
  and respect the fact that I may have different views\non API design from yours.*\n\nI
  have spent time to write the library because sending HTTP requests is such\na common
  thing and still there is no high-level library for that in Haskell\nthat I could
  use with pleasure. I'll explain why.\n\nFirst of all, there is `http-client` and
  `http-client-tls`. They just work.\nI have no issues with the libraries except that
  they are too low-level for\nmy taste. Indeed, even the docs say that they are low-level
  and “intended as\na base layer for more user-friendly packages”. This is exactly
  how I use\nthem in Req, as base level. Req is nothing but a different API to\n`http-client`,
  so it only works because of the hard work put into\n`http-client`.\n\n`http-conduit`
  definitely has its place. For one thing it allows you to\nstream request and response
  bodies in constant memory, what other library\nallows you to do that? On the other
  hand if you take a look at\n`Network.HTTP.Simple`, then although it's said that
  it's a “higher level\nAPI”, it's mostly the same as vanilla `http-client` in spirit/approach
  and\njust adds `conduit`-powered functions to perform requests and allows to use\nglobal
  implicit `Manager` (Req does the same). If I tried to frame what\nexactly I don't
  like about `http-conduit` in words, then it would be “the\nway requests are constructed”.
  You set, set, set instead of *being forced*\nto declare necessary bits and *being
  allowed* to declare optional bits in a\nway that their combination is certainly
  valid. And you parse request from a\nstring without the protection of TH that otherwise
  saves the day as in\nYesod.\n\nThen there is Wreq. `wreq` [doesn't see much development\nlately](https://github.com/bos/wreq/issues/93).
  `wreq` is by itself a weird\nlibrary, IMO. You have functions per method—not very
  good, as there may be\nnew methods, like PATCH which is not new but still missing
  (well you have\n`customMethod`, but what is the point of having per-method functions
  if you\nhave a more general way to use any method? you should be able to just insert\nmethods
  in the “argument slot” of `customMethod` and end up with a more\ngeneral solution).
  Now every method function has a companion that takes\n`Options` (like you have `get`
  and `getWith`). Why the duplication? Where is\ngenerality and flexibility? This
  is not all though, because you cannot\nreally use `get` you see in the main module,
  because you want to have\nconnection sharing. Wreq's author does not take the gift
  of automatic\nconnection re-use `Manager` from `http-client` provides, he invents
  the\nwhole new thing of “sessions”. Only inside a session your connections will\nbe
  shared and re-used. However with the session stuff you have yet another\nset of
  per-method functions like `get` and `getWith`—these are different\nones, to be used
  with sessions! Now if you have a multi-threaded app, here\nis a surprise for you:
  you can't share connections between threads as\nconnections are shared only inside
  `withSession` friend and “session will no\nlonger be valid after that function returns”.
  There are valid uses for\nsessions, but the point is that they are just too inconvenient
  for common\ntasks.\n\nIt's funny that one client I worked for had to have his own
  little wrapper\naround `http-client` just because he could not possibly use `wreq`
  and\n`http-client` and friends were too low-level. The previous paragraph is\nextracted
  from a talk with a Haskell developer who works for that client. I\nthought to myself
  “something is wrong with HTTP client libraries in Haskell\nif they had to make a
  wrapper”.\n\nWhat else? I used `servant-client` a couple of times but the amount
  of\nboilerplate it requires is frightening. If you have several query\nparameters,
  and you use just one of them, good luck passing lots of\n`Nothing`s.\n\n## Unsolved
  problems\n\nAWS request signing is problematic because request body can be in the
  form\nof an action to execute (and all that “popper” stuff for streaming), not\njust
  a `ByteString` and so getting its digest (hash) is not trivial without\nrunning
  the action and consuming body in its entirety before the request in\nmade. In Wreq
  the author chose to just use `error` when body is not a\n(strict or lazy) `ByteString`.
  Maybe it's OK for Wreq, but I don't consider\nthis a proper solution for Req as
  we support full variety of body options.\nFor example, what if I want to upload
  1 Gb file to S3? I want to stream it\nin constant memory but at the same time I
  need to calculate its hash before\nI start streaming. One solution to the problem
  seems to be in taking the\nhash explicitly (as an argument of the hypothetical `awsAuth`)
  and making it\na responsibility of the user to calculate the hash correctly. I don't
  like\nthis because it's not user-friendly. So the question stays open, for now\nthere
  is no AWS signing functionality provided out-of-the-box. The best\nsolution for
  talking to AWS is the `amazonka` package so far.\n\n## Related packages\n\nThe following
  packages are designed to be used with Req:\n\n* [`req-conduit`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/req-conduit)—support\n
  \ for streaming request and response bodies in constant memory.\n\nIf you happen
  to have written a package that adds new features to Req,\nplease submit a PR to
  include it in this list.\n\n## Blog posts\n\n* [Req 1.0.0, HTTP client, and streaming](https://markkarpov.com/post/req-1.0.0-http-client-and-streaming.html)\n\n##
