changelog: |
  ## Req 3.9.1

  * Builds with GHC 9.0.

  ## Req 3.9.0

  * The `useHttpURI` and `useHttpsURI` functions now preserve trailing
    slashes.

  ## Req 3.8.0

  * Adjusted the value of the `httpConfigRetryJudgeException` field of
    `defaultHttpConfig` to retry on response timeouts and connection timeouts.

  ## Req 3.7.0

  * Added `reqCb`, a function that allows you to modify the `Request` object
    but otherwise performs the requst for you.

  * Derived `MonadThrow`, `MonadCatch`, and `MonadMask` for the `Req` monad.

  ## Req 3.6.0

  * Added the `httpConfigBodyPreviewLength` configuration parameter to
    `HttpConfig`.

  ## Req 3.5.0

  * Made `Req` an instance of `MonadUnliftIO`. [Issue
    100](https://github.com/mrkkrp/req/issues/100).

  ## Req 3.4.0

  * Requests using `DELETE` method can now have a body. [Issue
    89](https://github.com/mrkkrp/req/issues/89).

  * Added the `httpConfigRetryJudgeException` field to `HttpConfig` so that
    requests that result in exceptions can be retried. [Issue
    93](https://github.com/mrkkrp/req/issues/93).

  * Added the function `renderUrl`. [Issue
    83](https://github.com/mrkkrp/req/issues/83).

  ## Req 3.3.0

  * Derived `Show` instances for response types `IgnoreResponse`,
    `JsonResponse`, `BsResponse`, and `LbsResponse`.

  ## Req 3.2.0

  * Made the tests pass with `http-client-0.7` and later.

  * Added a quasiquoter for URL creation, `urlQ`.

  ## Req 3.1.0

  * Changed signature of `httpConfigRetryPolicy` to `RetryPolicyM IO`.

  ## Req 3.0.0

  * Dropped functions `parseUrlHttp`, `parseUrlHttps`, and `parseUrl`. Instead
    we now have `useHttpURI`, `useHttpsURI`, and `useURI` take `URI`s from
    `modern-uri` as their argument. You first parse your URL with the
    `modern-uri` package and then pass it to those functions. This allows us
    to work with typed URI representations and seamlessly convert them to
    something `req` can work with. As a side effect basic auth from the `URI`s
    is now taken into consideration. In the future we may also start to
    respect fragments if `http-client` starts to support this.

  * Dropped support for GHC 8.2 and older.

  ## Req 2.1.0

  * Dropped support for GHC 7.10.

  * Added the new `acceptHeader` method to the `HttpResponse` type class.
    Notably, the `jsonResponse` method now sets `"Accept"` header to
    `"application/json"`.

  ## Req 2.0.1

  * Fixed the `httpbin` tests (they changed something on the server again).

  ## Req 2.0.0

  * Got rid of `data-default-class` dependency, now we export
    `defaultHttpConfig` instead.

  ## Req 1.2.1

  * Fixed a typo in the type signature of `parseUrl`.

  ## Req 1.2.0

  * Added the `parseUrl` function.

  ## Req 1.1.0

  * Added `customAuth` and `attachHeader` to facilitate creation of custom
    authentication options.

  * Added `basicProxyAuth` authentication option.

  ## Req 1.0.0

  * Added the `reqBr` function allowing to consume `Response BodyReader`
    without using a pre-defined instance of `HttpResponse`, in a custom way.

  * Now streaming of response body does not happen until we've checked headers
    and status code with `httpConfigCheckResponse`. It also doesn't happen on
    every retry. Streaming and obtaining of final response value happens only
    once when we're happy with everything.

    Previously we first tried to consume and interpret response body before
    checking status code and determining whether we should retry the request.
    This was not good, because we could expect a JSON response but get a
    response with status code 500, and then still we would try to parse it as
    JSON first before letting `httpConfigCheckResponse` throw an exception.

    The corrected behavior should also make retrying more efficient.

  * Changed signatures of several fields of `HttpConfig`:
    `httpConfigCheckResponse`, `httpConfigRetryPolicy`, and
    `httpConfigRetryJudge` in order to eliminate redundant `IO` and prevent
    the possibility that these functions could start consuming `BodyReader`.

  * Removed the `makeResponsePreview` method from the `HttpResponse` type
    class. Preview business is handled by the library automatically on a lower
    level now. Users do not need to concern themselves with such stuff.

  * Changed the type signature of the `getHttpResponse` method of the
    `HttpResponse` type class. Previously it left too much freedom (and
    responsibility) to implementers of the method. In fact, we now limit what
    `getHttpResponse` does to just consuming and interpreting `Response
    BodyReader`, so we can properly control details of connection
    opening/closing etc., for the user.

  * Dropped support for GHC 7.8.

  * Minor documentation improvements.

  ## Req 0.5.0

  * Changed the signature of the `makeResponseBodyPreview` from `response ->
    IO ByteString` to `response -> ByteString`.

  * Minor documentation improvements.

  ## Req 0.4.0

  * Added the `Req` monad and `runReq` function to run it. This allows to use
    `req` without defining new (orphan) instances.

  ## Req 0.3.1

  * Added `basicAuthUnsafe`.

  ## Req 0.3.0

  * Made URL parsing functions `parseUrlHttp` and `parseUrlHttps` recognize
    port numbers.

  * Added `req'` function that allows to perform requests via a callback that
    receives pre-constructed request and manager.

  * Removed the `ReturnRequest` HTTP response implementation as it was not
    quite safe and was not going to work with retrying. Use `req'` instead for
    “pure” testing.

  * Changed the type of `httpConfigCheckResponse`, so the second argument can
    be any instance of `HttpResponse`.

  * Added built-in automatic retrying. See `httpConfigRetryPolicy` and
    `httpConfigRetryJudge` in `HttpConfig`. The default configuration retries
    5 times on request timeouts.

  * Added the `makeResponseBodyPreview` method to the `HttpResponse` type
    class that allows to specify how to build a “preview” of response body for
    inclusion into exceptions.

  * Improved wording in the documentation and `README.md`.

  ## Req 0.2.0

  * Added support for multipart form data in the form of `ReqBodyMultipart`
    body option and `reqBodyMultipart` helper function. This also required a
    change in the type signature of `getRequestContentType`, which now takes
    `body`, not `Proxy body` because we need to extract boundary from `body`
    and put it into `Content-Type` header. This change, however, shouldn't be
    too dangerous for end-users.

  * Added support for OAuth 1.0 authentication via `oAuth1` option.

  ## Req 0.1.0

  * Initial release.

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

  module Main (main) where

  import Control.Monad.IO.Class
  import Data.Aeson
  import Network.HTTP.Req

  main :: IO ()
  -- You can either make your monad an instance of 'MonadHttp', or use
  -- 'runReq' in any IO-enabled monad without defining new instances.

  ```

  Req is an HTTP client library that attempts to be easy-to-use, type-safe,
  and expandable.

  “Easy-to-use” means that the library is designed to be beginner-friendly so
  it's simple to add to your monad stack, intuitive to work with,
  well-documented, and does not get in your way. Doing HTTP requests is a
  common task and a Haskell library for this should be approachable and clear
  to beginners, thus certain compromises were made. For example, one cannot
  currently modify `ManagerSettings` of the default manager because the
  library always uses the same implicit global manager for simplicity and
  maximal connection sharing. There is a way to use your own manager with
  different settings, but it requires more typing.

  “Type-safe” means that the library tries to eliminate certain classes of
  errors. For example, we have correct-by-construction URLs; it is guaranteed
  that the user does not send the request body when using methods like GET or
  OPTIONS, and the amount of implicit assumptions is minimized by making the
  user specify their intentions in an explicit form. For example, it's not
  possible to avoid specifying the body or the method of a request.
  Authentication methods that assume HTTPS force the user to use HTTPS at the
  type level.

  “Expandable” refers to the ability to create new components without having
  to resort to hacking. For example, it's possible to define your own HTTP
  methods, create new ways to construct the body of a request, create new
  authorization options, perform a request in a different way, and create your
  own methods to parse a response.

  The library uses the following mature packages under the hood to guarantee
  you the best experience:

  * [`http-client`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-client)—low level
    HTTP client used everywhere in Haskell.
  * [`http-client-tls`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-client-tls)—TLS
    (HTTPS) support for `http-client`.

  It is important to note that since we leverage well-known libraries that the
  whole Haskell ecosystem uses, there is no risk in using Req. The machinery
  for performing requests is the same as with `http-conduit` and Wreq. The
  only difference is the API.

  ## Related packages

  The following packages are designed to be used with Req:

  * [`req-conduit`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/req-conduit)—support
    for streaming request and response bodies in constant memory.

  If you happen to have written a package that adds new features to Req,
  please submit a PR to include it in this list.
