  code

  -   [hoogle](https://www.stackage.org/package/hoogle)

  ``` {.haskell}
  main :: IO ()
  main = do
    let n = 10
    let answer = product [1..n::Integer]
    void $ runOutput ("example.lhs", LHS) ("readme.md", GitHubMarkdown) $ do
      output "example1" (Fence "Simple example of an output")
  ```

  ``` {.output .example1}
  Simple example of an output
  ```

  ``` {.haskell}
      output "example2" (Fence (show answer))
  ```

  10! is equal to:

  ``` {.output .example2}
  3628800
  ```

  As well as fenced output, output can be Text that replaces the {.output}
  code block

  ``` {.haskell}
      output "example3" (Replace "Fenced code block was overwritten")
  ```

  Fenced code block was overwritten

  or be native pandoc.

  ``` {.haskell}
      output "example4" (Native [BulletList [[plain "a"], [plain "bullet"], [plain "list"]]])
  ```

  -   a
  -   bullet
  -   list

  Output that doesn’t exist is simply cleared.

  Fenced code block was overwritten

  Technicals
  ==========

  This is an example of mixing literate haskell with markdown, and in
  using readme-lhs. The file is composed of several elements:

  -   literate haskell. Bird-tracks are used, as the alternative lhs
      method is latex. Pandoc can read this, but defaults to bird tracks
      when rendering `markdown+lhs`.

  -   markdown. All non bird-tracked lines are considered to be markdown.
      It’s probably incompatible with haddock. This might be easily
      fixable.

  -   fenced code blocks with an output class, which are used to insert
      computation results. The fenced code blocks look like:

      \`\`\`{.output .example} \`\`\`

  As it currently stands, ghc cannot read a file with fenced code-blocks
  that look like:

      \```haskell
      \```

  Given this, a file cannot be both a valid haskell file, and a markdown
  file that is rendered nicely by github. This would resolve with adoption
  of the [literate markdown ghc
  proposal](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/wikis/literate-markdown).

  template
  ========

  A bare bones stack template is located in
  [other/readme-lhs.hsfiles](other/readme-lhs.hsfiles). It contains what
  you need to quickly get started with literate programming.
