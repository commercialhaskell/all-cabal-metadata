  *starting a literate haskell narrative.*\n\nI've long suffered from procrastination
  in new projects. The coders equivalent for sharpening pencils is the creation of
  bespoke, boiler-plate scaffolding as one prevaricates about the guts of the project.
  I see evidence littered through my old repos - self-obsfucating technical debt encrusted
  on the interface between the project and RealWorld.\n\nSo, starting at the pointy
  end of a new project, I aligned my workflow with stack, and started looking at a
  reproducible, exact startup routine.  I followed the path to stack templates and
  wrote my own (`stack new project-name readme-lhs`), which was kindy accepted.\n\ndesign\n---\n\nStripping
  away optional extras, I went with a minimalist design:\n\n- markdown for all docs.
  \ Anything outside what markdown can do is me being too fancy.\n- pandoc for document
  conversion. `-f markdown+lhs` is a georgeous rendering of a .lhs file. I turn [github
  pages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/) on
  using the User Pages site method for each project I'd like to blog, and render readme.lhs
  to index.html using pandoc.\n- css for styling, but also dealing with github markdown
  style which is where many users will read your lhs.\n- using lhs as a valid haskell
  artform\n- readme.lhs as a general purpose executable, tester, example holder and
  all-round centralising communication document.\n- a long list of the most commonly-used,
  and mostly-benign language flags, NoImplicitPrelude & UnicodeSyntax.  I call this
  -XHaskell2016 in private.\n- the stack-recommended .travis.yml\n- Embedding [Protolude](https://www.stackage.org/package/protolude)
  as the replacement prelude.\n\nHere's what I threw out:\n\n- haddock. The design
  space of using markdown as a complete replacement is fresh territory.\n- test directory.
  I looked through my test and example directories and noted the mess in many. I love
  to test - creating a realistic arbitrary instance is the best way to get to know
  your data structures - but tests and multiple examples didn't belong in the start-up
  phase.\n- hakyll. For me, markdown created for a separate blogging process is better
  inside the actual  project as readme's - my hakyll site rots pretty quickly.\n-
  app directory.  The boundary between what the app is and what the library is is
  very fluid for me, and a source of technical debt as concepts bounce between directories.\n\nI
  then keep this repo around for phase 2, where a project takes a successful shape
  and and needs test and app boiler-plate.\n\nWorkflow\n---\n\nThis design must be
  monadic cause I seem to get a hyper-efficient workflow for free! The template reproducably
  installs and runs out of the box, with zero TODO items littered through the structure.\n\n~~~\nstack
  install && readme\n\n...\n\nCopied executables to /Users/tonyday/.local/bin:\n-
  readme\n\"ok\"\n~~~\n\nI gather libraries I guess I'm needing, adding to .cabal
  and imports added to readme.lhs.  Firing up a repl there, I start hacking some code
  together, saving the good bits to readme.lhs, adding notes and links, and getting
  some initial learnings coded up in main, so I can eyeball results. I use the following
  command to build, run, and render an index.html so pushing is also auto-publishing
  on github.\n\n~~~\nstack install && readme && pandoc -f markdown+lhs -i readme.lhs
  -t html -o index.html --filter pandoc-include --mathjax && pandoc -f markdown+lhs
  -i readme.lhs -t markdown -o readme.md --filter pandoc-include --mathjax\n~~~\n\ntodo:\n\n-
  [ ] can stack --file-watch help?\n- [ ] should pandoc be wrapped in the stack version
  ie `stack exec pandoc --`\n- [ ] reproducible build instructions with stack-only
  environment (travis)\n\nusage\n---\n\nTo just use the stack template:\n\n~~~\nstack
  new project-name readme-lhs\ncd project-name\nstack install\nreadme\n~~~\n\nand
  it should chirp back a cheery \"ok\".\n\nThe [template file](other/readme-lhs.hsfiles)
  can always be edited, renamed etc and dropped into a directory, and stack will find
  it.\n\n\nlhs\n---\nI use both .lhs and .hs styles, and often need to flip between
  the two. In particular, hlint didn't always play nice with .lhs, and for a while
  I needed to flip from .lhs to .hs, run hlint, and then flip back to .lhs.\n\nlhs
  makes no attempt to account for haddock and will thus not be suitable for most people.\n\nTo
  install and use lhs:\n\n~~~\ngit clone https://github.com/tonyday567/readme-lhs\ncd
  readme-lhs\nstack install\nlhs readme.lhs\n~~~\n\ncode\n---\n\nI tend to stick [protolude](http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/protolude.html)
  in most modules, which really cuts down on boiler-plate.\n\n> {-# OPTIONS_GHC -Wall
  #-}\n> {-# OPTIONS_GHC -fno-warn-type-defaults #-}\n> import Protolude\n> \n> main
  :: IO ()\n> main = do\n>   print \"readme-lhs library\"\n>   let fac n = foldr (\\x
  g n' -> g (x*n')) identity [1..n] 1\n>   writeFile \"other/example.md\" $\n>       \"$\\\\prod_{x=1}^{20}
  x = \" <> show (fac 20) <> \"$\\n\"\n>\n\nOutput from the code above appears in
  this readme.lhs when rendered with pandoc-include (except if you're reading this
  as the repo readme.md, sorry):\n\n```include\nother/example.md\n```\n\n\n"
