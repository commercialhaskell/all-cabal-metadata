  # `resource-registry`

  In some cases, the lifetime of a resource is not suitable for CPS and hence
  can't use `bracket`-like functions, for example, the resource might be tracked
  inside some other data structure. In this case, the container data structure can
  be allocated in a resource registry together with the resources so that an
  exception will deallocate the resources in a proper order.
