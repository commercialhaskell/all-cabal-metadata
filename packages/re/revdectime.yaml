description: "### DESCRIPTION\n\nRevDecTime is a tiny utility which displays the current
  French Revolutionary Decimal Time (metric clock). This representation of time was
  first introduced during the French Revolution in 1793, it became official in 1794
  but it never really caught on and mandatory use was suspended in 1795. The private
  opinion of the author of the present tiny tool is that it is a great shame, and
  that the idea is definitely worth another try.\n\nThe main idea behind decimal time
  is that duodecimal is quite an inconvenient system in our decimal world. In decimal
  time, each day is divided into ten (decimal) hours, each hour into a hundred minutes
  and each minute into a hundred seconds. As a result, the following relations hold:\n\t\n\tDuodecimal
  \    Decimal      | Decimal        Duodecimal\n\t----------------------------------------------------------\n\t1
  second     = 1.16 seconds | 1 second     = 0.864 seconds\n\t1 minute     = 0.69
  minutes | 1 minute     = 1.44 minutes\n\t1 hour       ≈ 0.42 hours   | 1 hour       =
  2.4 hours\n\nThis means that decimal decimal seconds are slightly shorter than the
  ones we know, and decimal minutes are almost one and a half times longer and decimal
  hours are almost two and a half times longer than the ones used now.\n\nExamples:\n–
  midnight = 0:00; noon = 5:00;\n– 8 am = 3:33 (⅓ into the day);\n– 3 pm = 6:25; 6
  pm = 7:50; 8 pm = 8:33;\n– 1.5 h ≈ 0:62; 2 h ≈ 0:83.\n\nSome more information on
  decimal time can be found at:\n– http://zapatopi.net/metrictime/\n– http://www.decimaltime.hynes.net/\n"
