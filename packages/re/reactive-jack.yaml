description: |-
  MIDI is the Musical Instrument Digital Interface,
  JACK is the JACK Audio Connection Kit.
  This package allows to manipulate a sequence of MIDI events via JACK.
  It is intended to be plugged as a playing assistant
  between a MIDI input device
  (e.g. a keyboard or a controller bank)
  and a MIDI controlled synthesizer
  (e.g. a software synthesizer or an external synthesizer).
  For software synthesizers see the Haskell packages
  @synthesizer-alsa@, @synthesizer-llvm@, @supercollider-midi@,
  @hsc3@, @YampaSynth@
  or the C packages @fluidsynth@ and @Timidity@.

  Applications include:
  Remapping of channels, controller, instruments, keys,
  Keyboard splitting, Conversion from notes to controllers, Latch mode,
  Convert parallel chords to serial patterns,
  Automated change of MIDI controllers,
  Delay and echo.

  It is intended that you write programs for MIDI stream manipulation.
  It is not intended to provide an executable program
  with all the functionality available
  in a custom programming interface.
  It is most fun to play with the stream editors in GHCi.
  However we provide an example module that demonstrates various effects.
