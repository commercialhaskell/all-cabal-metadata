  Monadic HTTP request handlers combinators to build a standalone web apps. Most of them deal with request data.
  Some of them allow mapping part of the URL to public folders in the file system. There is also a combinator for
  sending files efficiently in the response (a fork of the HTTP library was necessary for this, included here).
