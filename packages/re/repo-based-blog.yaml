  # repo-based-blog

  A blogging module that uses a repository as its content backend.

  # Usage

  The Haddock documentation of the module `Web.RBB` should contain enough
  information to get started.

  # Contributing

  As long as there are no web application specific changes required, I would
  usually just review and accept every pull request.

  ## Guidelines

  * Please write documentation!
  * Please try to write tests!
  * If an issue exists, reference it!
  * Similar to neovim's development, use [WIP], [RFC] and [RDY] as tags in
    pull requests. Especially the [WIP] annotation has the potential to avoid
    unnecessary duplicate work if the pull request is created immediately
    after starting to work at the issue.
