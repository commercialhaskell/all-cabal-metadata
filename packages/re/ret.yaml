description: "# Ret\n\nRet is a tool that goes up the directory chain and returns
  the first directory with a landmark.\n\nA landmark is an important property of the
  directory, such as the existence of a configuration file, being the user’s home
  directory, or being on a different drive.\n\nThis project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/schuelermine/ret/).
  \ \nThis project is on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ret/).\n\n##
  How to use\n\nYou can use this to go back to your project root in a jiffy by using
  your shell’s command substitution syntax,\ne.g.:\n\n```bash\ncd $(ret)\n```\n\nor\n\n```fish\ncd
  (ret)\n```\n\nYou can specify a set of landmark names as the arguments to `ret`
  to only use them.\nYou can also specify a set of default landmark names in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ret/landmarks.txt`,
  one per line.\n\nYou are invited to contribute more landmark specifications! Look
  in the source code, it’s easy.\n\n## Shell integration\n\nAfter installing (see
  below), you can make using `ret` even more convenient by defining a shell function
  that does `cd` for you.\n\ne.g.\n\n```bash\nret() {\n  cd $(command ret $@)\n}\n```\n\nor\n\n```fish\nfunction
  ret\n  cd (command ret $argv)\nend\n```\n\n## Installing\n\nThis project is hosted
  on Hackage. You can install it via:\n\n```sh\ncabal install ret\n```\n\nThis project
  is also redistributed for Nix in Nixpkgs under `haskellPackages.ret`.\n\n## Building\n\nClone
  the repository and run this in it:\n\n```sh\ncabal build\n```\n"
