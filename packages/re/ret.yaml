description: "# Ret\n\nRet is a tool that goes up the directory chain and returns
  the first directory with a landmark.\n\nA landmark is an important property of the
  directory, such as the existence of a configuration file, being the user’s home
  directory, or being on a different drive.\n\nThis project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/schuelermine/ret/).
  \ \nThis project is on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ret/).\n\n##
  How to use\n\nYou can use this to go back to your project root in a jiffy by using
  your shell’s command substitution syntax,\ne.g.:\n\n```bash\ncd $(ret)\n```\n\nor\n\n```fish\ncd
  (ret)\n```\n\nYou can specify a set of landmark names as the arguments to `ret`
  to only use them.\nYou can also specify a set of default landmark names in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ret/landmarks.txt`,
  one per line.\n\nYou are invited to contribute more landmark specifications! Or
  send me an email if you want one added.\n\n## Installing\n\nNote: All install methods
  except the NixOS one are untested by the author.\n\n### Shell integration\n\nAfter
  installing (see below), you can make using `ret` even more convenient by defining
  a shell function that does `cd` for you.\n\ne.g.\n\n```bash\nret() {\n  cd $(command
  ret \"$@\")\n}\n```\n\nor\n\n```fish\nfunction ret\n  cd (command ret $argv)\nend\n```\n\n###
  Manual install\n\nYou can, of course, manually copy the `ret` binary into a location
  of your choice.\nYou can download the binary from the GitHub releases or build it
  yourself.\n\n### Hackage install\n\nThis package is published on Hackage. You can
  install it using cabal-the-tool:\n\n```sh\ncabal install ret\n```\n\n### Debian
  install\n\n**Warning:** The Debian package is produced without care and has a wrong
  version number.\n\nYou can install the Debian package that’s downloadable from the
  GitHub releases page using `dpkg` or `apt` or another frontend.\n\n### Cabal install\n\nClone
  this repository and run\n\n```sh\ncabal install\n```\n\n### NixOS install\n\nThis
  repository provides a Nixpkgs overlay you can use to get this into your flake-based
  NixOS or home-manager config.  \nAdd `github:schuelermine/ret` to your inputs, add
  `ret.overlays.default` to your overlays, and add `ret` to your packages.\n\n## How
  to build\n\nYou can build it using The Haskell Cabal or Nix.\n\n### Cabal build\n\nUse
  cabal-the-tool:\n\n```sh\ncabal build\n```\n\n### Nix build\n\nFirst, enable the
  nix-command and flakes experimental features.  \nThen, run:\n\n```sh\nnix build\n```\n\n###
  Build a Debian package\n\nMake sure that you have Nix installed and enabled the
  nix-command and flakes experimental features.\n\n```sh\nnix bundle --bundler bundlers#toDEB\n```\n"
