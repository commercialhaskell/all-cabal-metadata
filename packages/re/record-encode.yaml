description: ! "# record-encode\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ocramz/record-encode.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ocramz/record-encode)\n\nThis
  library provides generic machinery to encode values of some algebraic type as points
  in a vector space.\n\nAnalyzing datasets that have one or more categorical variables
  (that is, values having a sum type) typically requires a series of boilerplate transformations,
  and the `encodeOneHot` function provided here does precisely that.\n\n# Usage example\n\n```\n
  \   {-# language DeriveGeneric -#}\n\n    import qualified GHC.Generics as G\n    import
  qualified Generics.SOP as SOP\n    \n    import Data.Record.Encode\n\n    data X
  = A | B | C deriving (G.Generic)\n    instance SOP.Generic X\n```\n\n```\n    >
  encodeOneHot B\n    [0,1,0]\n```\n\n\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nGagandeep Bhatia (@gagandeepb)
