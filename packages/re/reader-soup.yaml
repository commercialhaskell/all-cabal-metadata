description: |-
  Packs together a stack of reader-like monads as one single ReaderT of a
  composite state (represented as an array). This permits to represent the
  entire monad stack of an application as one record (in the vinyl sense) of the
  parameters used to run this monad stack, and to add capabilities to that stack
  by just adding a new field to that record. reader-soup is part of the
  porcupine ecosystem. See the README at
  <https://github.com/tweag/porcupine#README.md>
