  # What?

  Consider you are falling a sleep at 2:00am, so next day for you starts
  from 2:00, not from 0:00. So, if now is 2017-10-10T01:00 and you did
  not sleept yet, then this is still 2017-10-09 for you.

  ```
  >>> let now = ZonedTime (LocalTime (fromGregorian 2017 10 10) (TimeOfDay 01 00 00)) utc
  >>> now
  2017-10-10 01:00:00 UTC
  >>> realDay (TimeOfDay 0 0 0) now
  2017-10-10
  >>> realDay (TimeOfDay 2 0 0) now
  2017-10-09

  ```

  This function shifts day switch to the specified time. It may be
  useful for some logging software and similar stuff.
