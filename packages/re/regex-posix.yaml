  The POSIX regex backend for <//hackage.haskell.org/package/regex-base regex-base>.

  The main appeal of this backend is that it's very lightweight due to its reliance on the ubiquitous <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/regex.h.html POSIX.2 regex> facility that is provided by the standard C library on most POSIX platforms.

  See also <https://wiki.haskell.org/Regular_expressions> for more information.
