description: |-
  Provides code for binary parsing of ESRI shapefiles,
  where the .shp and the .dbf file are read. The code has
  not been tested on a large variety of shapefiles so
  your mileage may vary, but so far it has worked with
  no problems. At the moment only text and number fields
  in DBF files are read (the others are stored as
  ByteString).
