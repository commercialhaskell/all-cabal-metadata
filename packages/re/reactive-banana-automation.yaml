synopsis: home (etc) automation using reactive-banana
changelog: ! "reactive-banana-automation (0.2.0) upstream; urgency=medium\n\n  * Automation
  is now a newtype. (API change)\n  * Monoid instance for Automation to allow easily
  combining them.\n    (Note that in 0.1, there were inherited Monoid and Monad instances\n
  \   for Automation, that did not work in a reasonable way.)\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>
  \ Thu, 03 May 2018 18:54:04 -0400\n\nreactive-banana-automation (0.1.2) upstream;
  urgency=medium\n\n  * Added ClockSignal and related functions.\n  * Functor instances
  for Sensed and Timestamped.\n  * Added more Timestamp instances.\n  * Generalized
  sensedAt to work with any Timestamp.\n  * Added several more examples, including
  a night light,\n    a behavior for a tipping bucket rain gauge, and sprinkers\n
  \   that only run when it's not rained recently.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>

  which involves sensor values that vary over time and are used to control

  actuators.
