  # request

  ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*5KglaZoNp4fNpNHUao5u5w.jpeg)

  HTTP client for haskell, inpired by [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/) and [http-dispatch](https://github.com/owainlewis/http-dispatch).

  ## Usage

  You can try this in haskell REPL once you have `request` installed:

  ```haskell
  import Network.HTTP.Request

  resp <- get "https://api.leancloud.cn/1.1/date"
  print $ requestStatus resp
  ```

  ## Core API

  Request's API has three core concepts: `Request` record type, `Response` record type, `send` function.

  ### Request

  `Request` is all about the information you will send to the target URL.

  ```haskell
  data Request = Request
    { requestMethod  :: Method
    , requestUrl     :: String
    , requestHeaders :: Headers
    , requestBody    :: Maybe Data.ByteString.ByteString
    } deriving (Show)
  ```

  ### send

  Once you have constructed your own `Request` record, you can call the `send` function to send it to the server. The `send` function's type is:

  ```haskell
  send :: Request -> IO Response
  ```

  ### Response

  `Response` is what you got from the server URL.

  ```haskell
  data Response = Response
    { responseStatus  :: Int
    , responseHeaders :: Headers
    , responseBody    :: Data.ByteString.ByteString
    } deriving (Show)
  ```

  ### Example

  ```haskell
  :set -XOverloadedStrings

  import Network.HTTP.Request

  -- Construct a Request record.
  let req = Request GET "https://api.leancloud.cn/1.1/date" [] Nothing
  -- Send it.
  res <- send req
  -- access the fields on Response.
  print $ requestStatus resp
  ```

  ## Shortcuts

  As you expected, there are some shortcuts for the most used scenarios.

  ```haskell
  get :: String -> IO Response
  get url =
    send $ Request GET url [] Nothing

  delete :: String -> IO Response
  delete url =
    send $ Request DELETE url [] Nothing

  post :: (String, Maybe Data.ByteString.ByteString) -> IO Response
  post (url, body) =
    send $ Request POST url [] body

  put :: (String, Maybe Data.ByteString.ByteString) -> IO Response
  put (url, body) =
    send $ Request PUT url [] body
  ```

  These shortcuts' definitions are simple and direct. You are encouraged to add your own if the built-in does not match your use cases, like add custom headers in every request.
