changelog: |
  # 0.3.0
  ## Breaking changes
  - Changed name from `hmenu` to `hdmenu`. Update your configuration paths accordingly.

  ## Added
  -   Directories can now be evaluated recursively; for that, suffix the directory with two stars:

      ``` toml
          files = [ "~/.config/zsh/**" ]
      ```

  # 0.2.4
  ## Added
  -   Users may now specify directories in the files list.  This lists all their
      contents and puts those files in the list.
  -   New command line option `--histFile` (short: `f`) to specify a history file
      to use.
  -   New command line option `--files-only` (short: `o`) to *only* show the
      user-defined files.

  ## Changed
  -   We now explicitly ignore directories in when they occur as sub directories
      of specified paths.
  -   Fixed a bug related to parsing filenames with spaces.
  -   Compatibility with GHC 9.2.5, dropped support for GHC < 8.10.x.

  # 0.2.3
  ## Changed
  -   The history file got a new layout.

  # 0.2.2
  ## Added
  -   Users may now specify a list of applications to be opened in a terminal.

  # 0.2.1
  ## Changed
  -   Files are not selected via prefixes anymore, but instead with a simple check
      if the selected item was in the files list.

  # 0.2.0
  ## Added
  -   Often used commands get displayed first.

  # 0.1.0
  Initial release

  # hdmenu

  `hdmenu` is a small wrapper around dmenuâ€”it can't do very much, though I
  guess that's the point. It might be most notable for being a discount
  `yeganesh`.

  ## Features

  1. Display commands in order of usage and, optionally, apply a frequency decay every time an item is selected.
  2. Specify extra files to consider, which will be opened by a program of your choice (e.g., `xdg-open`).
  3. Open certain executables inside of your terminal.

  ## Configuration

  Hdmenu is configured using a [TOML] file inside the `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hdmenu` directory (probably `~/.config/hdmenu`).
  See `example.toml` for an example configuration.

  Note that, while having a config file is optional,
  the `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hdmenu` directory will be created in either case,
  in order to store the history file there.

  ### Configuration option

  The configuration file takes the following arguments:

    - `open` : A custom opening script (default: `xdg-open`).

    - `files`: Files one wishes to edit; they will be opened according to
      `open`. This can also take directories

      ``` toml
      files = [ "~/.config/emacs/" ]
      ```

      in which case all *files* in that directory will be added to the list of files that `hdmenu` cares about.
      Directories can also be traversed recursively:

      ``` toml
      # Files from `~/.config/emacs/' and all of its subdirectories.
      files = [ "~/.config/emacs/" ]
      ```

    - `executable`: Custom dmenu executable (default: `dmenu`).

    - `terminal`: A terminal emulator (default: `xterm`).

    - `tty-programs`: A list of programs to be opened in the above
      terminal emulator. For example, specifying

      ``` toml
      tty-programs = [ "htop" ]
      ```

      will effectively enable one to start `htop` directly from dmenu without having to open an extraneous terminal.

    - `decay`: A frequency decay; all non-selected items will be multiplied by this number (default: `1`).
      A good value may be something like `0.997`

  ### Command line options

    - `--histFile`
        - Short: `-f`
        - Description: Path to the history file to use.

    - `--files-only`
        - Short: `-o`
        - Description: Whether to only show the user-specified files.

    - `--decay`
        - Short: `-d`
        - Description: A frequency decay; all non-selected items will be
          multiplied by this

  All options after `--` will be directly forwarded to `dmenu`, so you may
  specify options in the following way:

      hdmenu -f /path/to/file -- -i -f -nb '#282A36' -nf '#BBBBBB' -sb '#8BE9FD' -sf '#000000' -fn 'Inconsolata Regular-10'

  # Installation

  ## Stack

  Build with `stack build`, then copy the executable to a convenient
  location (or just use `stack install`, to copy the executable to the
  local-bin-path).

  ## Cabal

  Build with `cabal install`.
