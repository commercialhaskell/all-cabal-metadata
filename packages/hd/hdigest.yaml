description: |-
  For web applications running in a CGI monad container, this module
  provides a simple interface to generate HTTP Digest authentication
  challenges and to process the responses from clients. It implements
  RFC2617, but accepts the quirky responses generated by some
  non-compliant browsers.

  This module was originally implemented for Serialist
  (<http://serialist.net>) and is deployed there in a FastCGI
  environment using the fastcgi package. It has been tested against a
  variety of browsers, including Firefox, Safari, IE, Opera, and others.
