description: ! 'HaskellDirect is an IDL compiler for Haskell, which offers a helping

  hand to the Haskell programmer that wants to better interact with

  and reuse external code.


  Interfacing Haskell code to external code involves the conversion of

  values between the Haskell world and the outside, as data

  representations and details of how memory is managed, are worlds

  apart at times. Manually writing the boilerplate code that takes

  care of this conversion is about as exciting as watching grass grow

  and, as a result, error prone.


  Using an Interface Definition Language (IDL) as basis, HaskellDirect

  automates the generation of such impedance matching code, generating

  all the necessary marshaling code for you.


  With IDL, the functionality provided by a programming interface is

  specified in a programming language neutral framework. The

  HaskellDirect IDL compiler converts this specification into a set of

  method stubs. Depending on how the compiler is invoked, these stubs

  can be used to:


  * Call upon external functions from within Haskell, HaskellDirect creates bindings
  to external (C-callable) libraries.


  * Let external code call upon Haskell functions, HaskellDirect creates foreign/external
  language interfaces to Haskell libraries.


  * Call COM (Microsoft''s Component Object Model) methods from Haskell, HaskellDirect
  helps you use Microsoft COM components from within Haskell.  The generated stubs
  can be used with Hugs98 or GHC.


  * Create COM method wrappers, HaskellDirect packages up Haskell code as COM components.


  The HaskellDirect IDL compiler currently groks both the OSF DCE

  dialect of IDL (including the various extensions introduced by the

  Microsoft IDL compiler) and the OMG IIOP/CORBA dialect. (Only the

  former can be used for describing COM interfaces.)
