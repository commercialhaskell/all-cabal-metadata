  HDBC
  ====

  Welcome to HDBC, Haskell Database Connectivity.

  HDBC is modeled loosely on Perl's DBI interface, though it has also
  been influenced by Python's DB-API v2, JDBC in Java, and HSQL in
  Haskell.

  Please see the HDBC [wiki](https://github.com/hdbc/hdbc/wiki) for an
  introduction to HDBC and its various features.

  Installation
  ------------

  You'll need either GHC 6.4.1 or above, or Hugs 2005xx or above.

  The steps to install are:

      ghc --make -o setup Setup.lhs
      ./setup configure
      ./setup build
      sudo ./setup install

  If you're on Windows, you can omit the leading "./".

  Usage
  -----

  To use with hugs, you'll want to use hugs -98.

  To use with GHC, you'll want to use -package HDBC in your programs.
  Or, with Cabal, use Build-Depends: HDBC.
