description: ! 'This is not a cricket game. Hricket is a scoring application that
  will save you from having to draw up a Cricket scorecard if you don''t have a chalkboard,
  or just don''t feel like getting chalk on your hands. ;)


  It supports two players, and will likely never support more. The bullseye is represented
  as the number ''21''. This was done to avoid unnecessary complexity, and might change
  in future versions, but for now, the bullseye is 21. When you hit a bullseye, you
  enter 21, and not bullseye or b. If you try to enter those, it will tell it that
  it''s invalid and have you try again.


  The recommended way to use this application, is to begin by opening it up and entering
  the names of both players. You''ll then want player 1 to throw 3 darts. Enter each
  dart into the application one at a time. You''ll type the number you hit on the
  board, a single space, and the number of markings. For instance, if you hit the
  number 16 in the treble, you would enter ''16 3''. If you hit 20 in the single you
  would enter ''20 1''. For numbers lower than 15, which are not used in standard
  Cricket games, you can either enter 0, or go ahead and enter the number you hit
  and the number of markings, but that will take longer. When all numbers are closed
  by one of the players, that player''s score will be ran against the other players
  score, and if it''s higher, that player will be declared the winner. Otherwise,
  the other player wins.


  You are expected to know how to play Cricket before using this application. This
  is not a Cricket tutorial, and the application will not teach you to play Cricket.




  I made this application our of necessity and boredom. Enjoy.'
