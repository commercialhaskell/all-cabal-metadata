  Bidirectional Python-ish slicing traversals for Haskell.

  Many thanks to [Chris Penner](https://github.com/chrispenner) who did all of
  the heavy lifting in creating the actual traversals.

  ## Introduction

  This package provides traversals that allow addressing any `Traversable` using
  python style slicing.

  The cliff notes:

  ```haskell
  "Slice of Py" ^.. sliced [s|2:5|]        -- sliced + slice quasiquote
    == "ice"

  "Slice of Py" ^.. [sd|2:5|]              -- sliced quasiquote
    == "ice"

  "Slice of Py" ^.. sliced "2:5"           -- sliced + slice string
    == "ice"

  "Slice of Py" & partsOf [sd|2::2|] %~ reverse
    == "Slyc  ofePi"

  "Slice of Pi" & [sd|:5|] %~ toUpper
    == "SLICE of Pi"

  [1..10] ^.. [sd|3::3|]
    == [4,7,10]

  [1..10] ^.. [sd|::-1|]
    == [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
  ```

  Fundamentally Python slices are captured by the Haskell data type `(Maybe Int,
  Maybe Int, Maybe Int)`.  As such you can use this type directly as a slice but
  writing out slices like `(Just 3, Nothing, Just (-1))` is fairly cumbersome so
  we also provide the `Slice` class to treat other types as slices and provide
  implementations for `(Int, Int Int)` as well as Strings (eg. `"1:10:2"`).

  The `String` instance is convenient for use in ghci or small projects but lacks
  type safety of course.  If you provide a String that is not parseable into a
  valid slice it won't be caught until runtime.  Likewise a step size of zero,
  which is an error, will not be caught until runtime.

  To provide a type-safe middle ground between the more cumbersome tuple syntax
  and the simpler string syntax we also provide an `s` quasiquoter (shown above)
  that allows writing slices as `[s|1:2:3|]` as well as an `sd` quasiquoter that
  fills in the `sliced` lens for you allowing eg `foo ^.. sliced ":5"` to be
  written as `foo ^.. [sd|:5|]`.

  With the quasiquoted versions anything that doesn't parse
  as a valid slice (including step sizes of zero) will be caught at runtime.

  The `sliced` traversal is an IndexedTraversal but it is created by conjoining
  the actual indexed traversal and an non-indexed version so if the index ends up
  being used it switches to the indexed version but otherwise has the performance
  of the unindexed one.

  In addition to the `sliced` function generates an appropriate traversal from
  any instance of the `Slice` class, the `sliced'` function which generates an
  appropriate traversal from three individual `Int` parameters (start, send and
  step) is exposed.

  ## Differences from Python

  ### Slice Indices

  Many slice operations will work identically to their python counterparts, eg:

  | Python                                              | Haskell                                             |
  |-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
  | >>> "Slice of Py"[::]<br> "Slice of Py"             | λ "Slice of Py" ^.. sliced "::"<br> "Slice of Py"   |
  | >>> "Slice of Py"[:3]<br> "Sli"                     | λ "Slice of Py" ^.. sliced ":3"<br> "Sli"           |
  | >>> "Slice of Py"[3:]<br> "ce of Py"                | λ "Slice of Py" ^.. sliced "3:"<br> "ce of Py"      |
  | >>> "Slice of Py"[::2]<br> "Sieo y"                 | λ "Slice of Py" ^.. sliced "::2"<br> "Sieo y"       |
  | >>> "Slice of Py"[::-1]<br> "yP fo ecilS"           | λ "Slice of Py" ^.. sliced "::-1"<br> "yP fo ecilS" |
  | >>> "Slice of Py"[::-2]<br> "y oeiS"                | λ "Slice of Py" ^.. sliced "::-2"<br> "y oeiS"      |
  | >>> "Slice of Py"[2:-2]<br> "ice of"                | λ "Slice of Py" ^.. sliced "2:-2"<br> "ice of"      |
  | >>> "Slice of Py"[1:2]<br> "l"                      | λ "Slice of Py" ^.. sliced "1:2"<br> "l"            |
  | >>> "Slice of Py"[2:1]<br> ""                       | λ "Slice of Py" ^.. sliced "2:1"<br> ""             |
  | >>> "Slice of Py"[1:-1]<br> "lice of P"             | λ "Slice of Py" ^.. sliced "1:-1"<br> "lice of P"   |
  | >>> "Slice of Py"[1:2:-1]<br> ""                    | λ "Slice of Py" ^.. sliced "1:2:-1"<br> ""          |
  | >>> "Slice of Py"[11::-2]<br> "y oeiS"              | λ "Slice of Py" ^.. sliced "11::-2"<br> "y oeiS"    |
  | >>> "Slice of Py"[0:9]<br> "Slice of"               | λ "Slice of Py" ^.. sliced "0:9"<br> "Slice of"     |
  | >>> "Slice of Py"[0:10]<br> "Slice of P"            | λ "Slice of Py" ^.. sliced "0:10"<br> "Slice of P"  |
  | >>> "Slice of Py"[0:11]<br> "Slice of Py"           | λ "Slice of Py" ^.. sliced "0:11"<br> "Slice of Py" |
  | >>> "Slice of Py"[0:12]<br> "Slice of Py"           | λ "Slice of Py" ^.. sliced "0:12"<br> "Slice of Py" |

  But some things work differently:

  | Python                                                 | Haskell                                                |
  |--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
  | >>> "Slice of Py"[2:1:-1]<br> "i"                      | λ "Slice of Py" ^.. sliced "2:1:-1"<br> "l"            |
  | >>> "Slice of Py"[2::-1]<br> "ilS"                     | λ "Slice of Py" ^.. sliced "2::-1"<br> "lS"            |
  | >>> "Slice of Py"[2::-2]<br> "iS"                      | λ "Slice of Py" ^.. sliced "2::-2"<br> "l"             |
  | >>> "Slice of Py"[10::-2]<br> "y oeiS"                 | λ "Slice of Py" ^.. sliced "10::-2"<br> "Pf cl"        |
  | >>> "Slice of Py"[12:0:-1]<br> "yP fo ecil"            | λ "Slice of Py" ^.. sliced "12:0:-1"<br> "yP fo ecilS" |
  | >>> "Slice of Py"[11:0:-1]<br> "yP fo ecil"            | λ "Slice of Py" ^.. sliced "11:0:-1"<br> "yP fo ecilS" |
  | >>> "Slice of Py"[10:0:-1]<br> "yP fo ecil"            | λ "Slice of Py" ^.. sliced "10:0:-1"<br> "P fo ecilS"  |
  | >>> "Slice of Py"[9:0:-1]<br> "P fo ecil"              | λ "Slice of Py" ^.. sliced "9:0:-1"<br> "fo ecilS"     |

  As you can see, python slice notation gets awkward in certain edge cases as
  described in [this stackoverflow
  answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation)
  whereas `sliced` uses a more consistent notation that lets you accomplish the
  same thing as `::-1` while specifying all indices.

  In addition since `sliced` is written in terms of `Traversable` you get slicing
  for free on any `Traversable` type rather than having to implement
  slice-specific interface like python's `__getitem__`.

  Python supports assignment to some types, eg lists:

  ```python
  >>> xs = [1,2,3,4,5]
  >>> xs[:2] = [10,20]
  >>> xs
  [10, 20, 3, 4, 5]
  ```

  But not all, eg strings:

  ```python
  >>> s = "Slice of Pi"
  >>> s[:5] = "Piece"
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
  ```

  Since `sliced` is a `Traversal` you can use the full power of the `lens`
  library with it including replacing parts of lists:

  ```haskell
  [1..5] & partsOf [sd|:2|] .~ [10,20]
    == [10,20,3,4,5]

  "Slice of Py" & partsOf [sd|9:3:-2|] .~ ['A'..]
    == "SlicC BfAPy"
  ```

  but also strings (or any other `Traversable`):

  ```haskell
  "Slice of Py" & partsOf [sd|:5|] .~ "Piece"
    == "Piece of Py"

  "Slice of Py" & partsOf [sd|5::-1|] .~ repeat 'X'
    == "XXXXX of Py"

  let t = unfoldTree (\n -> (n, replicate n (n-1))) 3
  putStr . drawTree . fmap show $ tree

  One significant deviation from the way Python's slices work is that in Python
  if you assign a list of a different size to a slice then the original list will
  be expanded or contracted to accomodate the size of the assigned slice:

  ```python
  >>> xs = [1,2,3,4,5]
  >>> xs[2:4] = [10,11,12,13,14,15]
  >>> xs
  [1, 2, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 5]
  >>> xs[2:8] = [100]
  >>> xs
  [1, 2, 100, 5]
  ```

  Whereas with a Haskell traversal if you provide fewer elements than were
  targeted then fewer elements will be overwritten and if you provide more
  elements than were targeted the extra elements will be ignored:

  ```haskell
  λ> [1,2,3,4,5] & partsOf (sliced "2:4") .~ [10..15]
  [1,2,10,11,5]
  λ> [1,2,10,11,12,13,14,15,5] & partsOf (sliced "2:8") .~ [100]
  [1,2,100,11,12,13,14,15,5]
  ```

  In addition to assignment/replacement you can of course use all of usual
  suspects like `over` (`%~`) or the various lens helpers:

  ```haskell
  λ> [1..10] & [sd|2:6|] %~ negate
  [1,2,-3,-4,-5,-6,7,8,9,10]

  λ> [1..10] & [sd|2:6|] *~ 10
  [1,2,30,40,50,60,7,8,9,10]

  λ> "Slice of Py" & [sd|:5|] %~ toUpper
  "SLICE of Py"

  λ> "Slice of Py" & partsOf [sd|::2|] %~ reverse
  "yl co efiPS"
  ```

  and of course you can chain on additional lens operations:

  ```haskell
  [1..10] & [sd|2:6|] . filtered even *~ 10
    == [1,2,3,40,5,60,7,8,9,10]

  [1..10] ^.. droppingWhile (<5) [sd|3:7|]
    == [5,6,7]

  "Slice of Py" ^.. worded . [sd|:1|]
    == "SoP"

  productOf [sd|2:5|] [1..10]
    == 60
  ```
