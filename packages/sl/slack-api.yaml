description: |-
  This library provides bindings to the <https://api.slack.com/rtm Slack Real Time Messaging API>.
  Users should find it easy to program their own Slack bots using the functionality found in `Web.Slack`.
  The bindings are very nearly complete. Library authors
  looking to build bindings to the <https://api.slack.com/web Slack Web API> may
  find the `FromJSON` instances located in `Web.Slack.Types`
  useful.
  Please note that the interface provided by this package is not yet stable. There are a number of unresolved
  internal inconsistencies which have yet to be resolved by Slack HQ.
