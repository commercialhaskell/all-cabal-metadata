  Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/mrkkrp/slug/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/mrkkrp/slug?branch=master)\n\nThis
  is [slug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_URL#Slug)\nimplementation that
  plays nicely with [Yesod](http://www.yesodweb.com/)\necosystem. Although it's fairly
  easy to write this thing, slugs are useful\nand general enough to be coded once
  and be used again and again. So this\nlittle package eliminates some boilerplate
  you might find yourself writing.\n\n## Quick start\n\nThe package provides data
  type `Slug` that is instance of various type\nclasses, so it can be used with Persistent
  or as part of route. It also\nworks with `aeson` package.\n\nThe slugs are completely
  type-safe. When you have a `Slug`, you can be sure\nthat there is a valid slug inside.
  Valid slug has the following qualities:\n\n* it's not empty;\n\n* it consists only
  of alpha-numeric groups of characters (words) separated\n  by `'-'` dashes in such
  a way that entire slug cannot start or end in a\n  dash and also two dashes in a
  row cannot be found;\n\n* every character with defined notion of case is lower-cased.\n\nTo
  use the package with persistent models, just import `Web.Slug` and add it\nto model
  file:\n\n```\nMyEntity\n  slug Slug\n  …\n```\n\nUse it in route file like this:\n\n```\n/post/#Slug
  PostR GET\n```\n\nIn Haskell code, create slugs from `Text` with `mkSlug` and extract
  their\ntextual representation with `unSlug`. The following property holds:\n\n```haskell\nmkSlug
  = mkSlug >=> mkSlug . unSlug\n```\n\n## License\n\nCopyright © 2015–2016 Mark Karpov\n\nDistributed
