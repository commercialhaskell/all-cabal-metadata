  * First version, with a foreign library and a test suite already.
changelog-type: markdown
description: |-
  A module similar to the "future" package of Chris Kuklewicz,
  but having a Future that is easy to represent and handle
  in C/C++,
  using two MVars.
  Moreover, it uses two new threads:
  one (the "watcher thread") aborts the calculation
  if triggered by filling the first MVar.
