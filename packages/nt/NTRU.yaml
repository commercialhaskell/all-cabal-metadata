  ============

  A Haskell Implementation of the NTRU Cryptographic library, following the IEEE Standard Specification (IEEE Std 1363.1-2008).
  Developed by Theo Levine, Elizabeth Hughes, and Tom Cornelius at Cyberpoint LLC (www.cyberpointllc.com).  Special thanks as well to Paul Li and Ian Blumenfeld.

  You can build it by running:
  ```
  cabal install NTRU
  ```

  or by downloading it and then running:
  ```
  cabal configure
  cabal build
  cabal install
  ```
  You can ignore the warnings from the build.

  A prebuilt hackage is available at http://hackage.haskell.org/package/NTRU. You may need to install some dependencies, such as llvm.
