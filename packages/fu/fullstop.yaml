description: |-
  FullStop splits texts into sentences, using some orthographical
  conventions (used in English and hopefully other languages).

  It recognises certain punctuation characters as sentence
  delimiters (@.?!@) and handles some abbreviations such as
  @Mr.@ and decimal numbers (eg. @4.2@).

  Note that this package is mostly a placeholder.  I hope
  the Haskell/NLP communities will run with it and upload
  a more sophisticated (family of) segmenter(s) in its
  place.  Patches (and new maintainers) would be greeted
  with delight!
