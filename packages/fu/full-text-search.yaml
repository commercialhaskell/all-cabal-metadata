description: |-
  An in-memory full text search engine library. It lets you
  run full-text queries on a collection of your documents.

  Features:

  * Keyword queries and auto-complete\/auto-suggest queries.

  * Can search over any type of \"document\".
  (You explain how to extract search terms from them.)

  * Supports documents with multiple fields
  (e.g. title, body)

  * Supports documents with non-term features
  (e.g. quality score, page rank)

  * Uses the state of the art BM25F ranking function

  * Adjustable ranking parameters (including field weights
  and non-term feature scores)

  * In-memory but quite compact. It does not keep a copy of
  your original documents.

  * Quick incremental index updates, making it possible to
  keep your text search in-sync with your data.

  It is independent of the document type, so you have to
  write the document-specific parts: extracting search terms
  and any stop words, case-normalisation or stemming. This
  is quite easy using libraries such as
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tokenize tokenize> and
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/snowball snowball>.

  The source package includes a demo to illustrate how to
  use the library. The demo is a simplified version of how
  the library is used in the
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hackage-server hackage-server>
  where it provides the backend for the package search feature.
