  (Japanese article)\n\n## Motivational examples\n\nMany types defined in [base](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.18.1.0)
  and popolar libraries like\n[transformers](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers-0.6.1.1)
  take a parameter expecting a `Functor`.\nHere are two, simple examples.\n\n```haskell\n--
  From \"base\", Data.Functor.Sum\ndata Sum f g x = InL (f x) | InR (g x)\ninstance
  (Functor f, Functor g) => Functor (Sum f g)\n\n-- From \"transformers\", Control.Monad.Trans.Reader\nnewtype
  ReaderT r m x = ReaderT { runReaderT :: r -> m x }\ninstance (Functor m) => Functor
  (ReaderT r m)\n```\n\nThese types often have a way to map a natural transformation,
  an arrow between two `Functor`s,\nover that parameter.\n\n```haskell\n-- The type
  of natural transformations\ntype (~>) f g = forall x. f x -> g x\n\nmapRight ::
  (g ~> g') -> Sum f g ~> Sum f g'\nmapRight _  (InL fx) = InL fx\nmapRight nt (InR
  gx) = InR (nt gx)\n\nmapReaderT :: (m a -> n b) -> ReaderT r m a -> ReaderT r n
  b\n\n-- mapReaderT can be used to map natural transformation\nmapReaderT' :: (m
  ~> n) -> (ReaderT r m ~> ReaderT r n)\nmapReaderT' naturalTrans = mapReaderT naturalTrans\n```\n\nThe
  type class `FFunctor` abstracts type constructors equipped with such a function.\n\n```haskell\nclass
  (forall g. Functor g => Functor (ff g)) => FFunctor ff where\n    ffmap :: (Functor
  g, Functor h) => (g ~> h) -> ff g x -> ff h x\n\nffmap :: (Functor g, Functor g')
  => (g ~> g') -> Sum f g x -> Sum f g' x\nffmap :: (Functor m, Functor n)  => (m
  ~> n) -> ReaderT r m x -> ReaderT r n x\n```\n\nNot all but many `FFunctor` instances
  can, in addition to `ffmap`, support `Monad`-like operations.\nThis package provide
  another type class `FMonad` to represent such operations.\n\n```haskell\nclass (FFunctor
  mm) => FMonad mm where\n    fpure :: (Functor g) => g ~> mm g\n    fbind :: (Functor
  g, Functor h) => (g ~> ff h) -> ff g a -> ff h a\n```\n\nBoth of the above examples,
  `Sum` and `ReaderT r`, have `FMonad` instances.\n\n```haskell\ninstance Functor
  f => FMonad (Sum f) where\n    fpure :: (Functor g) => g ~> Sum f g\n    fpure =
  InR\n\n    fbind :: (Functor g, Functor h) => (g ~> Sum f h) -> Sum f g a -> Sum
  f h a\n    fbind _ (InL fa) = InL fa\n    fbind k (InR ga) = k ga\n\ninstance FMonad
  (ReaderT r) where\n    fpure :: (Functor m) => m ~> ReaderT r m\n    -- return ::
  x -> (e -> x)\n    fpure = ReaderT . return\n\n    fbind :: (Functor m, Functor
  n) => (m ~> ReaderT r n) -> ReaderT r m a -> ReaderT r n a\n    -- join :: (e ->
  e -> x) -> (e -> x)\n    fbind k = ReaderT . (>>= runReaderT . k) . runReaderT \n```\n\n##
  Comparison against similar type classes\n\nThere are packages with very similar
  type classes, but they are more or less different to this package.\n\n* From [hkd](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hkd):
  `FFunctor`\n  \n  There is a class named `FFunctor` in `hkd` package too. It represents
  a functor from /category of type constructors/ `k -> Type` to\n  the category of
  usual types and functions.\n\n  Since it is not an endofunctor, there can be no
  `Monad`-like classes on them.\n\n  Another package [rank2classes](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rank2classes)
  also provides the same class `Rank2.Functor`.\n  \n* From [mmorph](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmorph-1.2.0):
  `MFunctor`, `MMonad`\n\n  `MFunctor` is a class for endofunctors on the category
  of `Monad`s and monad homomorphisms.\n  If `T` is a `MFunctor`, it takes a `Monad
  m` and constructs `Monad (T m)`,\n  and its `hoist` method takes a *Monad morphism*
  `m ~> n` and returns a new *Monad morphism* `T m ~> T n`.\n\n  On the other hand,
  this library is about endofunctors on the category of `Functor`s and natural transformations,\n
  \ which are similar but definitely distinct concept.\n\n  For example, `Sum f` in
  the example above is not an instance of `MFunctor`, since there are no general way
  to make `Sum f m` a `Monad`\n  for arbitrary `Monad m`.\n\n  ```\n  instance Functor
  f => FFunctor (Sum f)\n  instance Functor f => MFunctor (Sum f) -- Can be written,
  but it will violate the requirement to be MFunctor\n  ```\n\n* From [index-core](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/index-core):
  `IFunctor`, `IMonad`\n\n  They are endofunctors on the category of type constructors
  of kind `k -> Type` and polymorphic functions `t :: forall (x :: k). f x -> g x`.\n
  \ \n  While any instance of `FFunctor` from this package can be faithfully represented
  as a `IFunctor`, some instances can't be an instance of `IFunctor` _as is_.\n  Most
  notably, [Free](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/free-5.1.8/docs/Control-Monad-Free.html#t:Free)
  can't be an instance of `IFunctor` directly,\n  because `Free` needs `Functor h`
  to be able to implement `fmapI`, the method of `IFunctor`.\n\n  ```haskell\n  class
  IFunctor ff where\n    fmapI :: (g ~> h) -> (ff g ~> ff h)\n  ```\n\n  There exists
  a workaround: you can use another representation of `Free f` which doesn't require
  `Functor f` to be a `Functor` itself,\n  for example `Program` from [operational](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/operational)
  package.\n\n  This package avoids the neccesity of the workaround by admitting the
  restriction that the parameter of `FFunctor` must always be a `Functor`.\n  Therefore,
  `FFunctor` gives up instances which don't take `Functor` parameter, for example,
  a type constructor `F` with kind `F :: (Nat -> Type) -> Nat -> Type`.\n\n* From
  [functor-combinators](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/functor-combinators-0.4.1.2):
  `HFunctor`, `Inject`, `HBind`\n\n  This package can be thought of as a more developed
  version of `index-core`, since they share the base assumption.\n  The tradeoff between
  this package is the same: some `FFunctor` instances can only be `HFunctor` via alternative
  representations.\n  Same applies for `FMonad` versus `Inject + HBind`.\n"
