  # funbot-client

  This is a Haskell library for reporting events to a running instance of
  [FunBot][funbot], so that the bot can announce the event to IRC. For example,
  if you are writing a paste server, you can add support for IRC announcments of
  new pastes by reporting the paste to a running bot.
