  # v1.0.0.0

  - Adds an `Empty` effect, modelling nondeterminism without choice ([#196](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/196)).

  - Adds an `EmptyC` carrier for `Empty`. ([#196](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/196))

  - Adds a `Choose` effect, modelling nondeterminism without failure ([#198](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/198)).

  - Adds a `Throw` effect, modelling failure with a value. ([#247](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/247))

  - Adds a `Catch` effect which can be used with `Throw` (or other kinds of failure) to model recoverable failure. ([#247](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/247))

  - Adds a `oneOf` function to `Control.Effect.NonDet` to provide an idiom for the common case of nondeterministically selecting from a container. ([#201](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/201))

  - Adds a `foldMapA` function to `Control.Effect.NonDet` mapping containers into nondeterministic computations using a supplied function. ([#204](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/204))

  - Defines a new `Has` constraint synonym, conveniently combining `Carrier` and `Member` constraints and used for all effect constructors. ([#217](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/217))

  - Allows effects to be defined and handled as sums of other effects, while still using the constructors for the component effects. This has been used to redefine `NonDet` as a sum of `Empty` and `Choose`, and `Error` as a sum of `Throw` and `Catch`. ([#199](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/199), [#219](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/219), [#247](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/247))

  - Defines `Carrier` instances for a number of types in `base`, including `Either`, `Maybe`, `[]`, and `IO`. ([#206](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/206))

  - Defines `Carrier` instances for a number of types in `transformers`. ([#226](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/226))

  - Defines an `evalFresh` handler for `Control.Carrier.Strict.FreshC`, taking the initial value. ([#267](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/267))


  ## Backwards-incompatible changes

  - Renames the `Carrier` class to `Algebra` and its `eff` method to `alg`, and moved the responsibilities of `Control.Carrier` to `Control.Algebra`. This makes the library more consistent with the literature and encourages a style of naming that focuses on morphisms rather than objects. ([#285](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/285), [#294](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/294))

  - Fixes unlawful behaviour in the `Applicative` instance for `ErrorC`, which had different behaviour between `<*>` and `ap` in the presence of a divergent rhs. In order to accomplish this, `ErrorC` has been defined as a wrapper around `Control.Monad.Trans.Except.ExceptT`. ([#228](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/228))

  - Improves the performance of `runInterpret` using reflection, changing its signature slightly ([#193](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/193), h/t [@ocharles](https://github.com/ocharles)).

  - Removes `Control.Effect.Random` (and the dependencies on `random` & `MonadRandom`) in favour of a new [`fused-effects-random` package](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects-random) ([#200](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/200)).

  - Removes `fmap'` and `handlePure`, both deprecated in 0.5.0.0 ([#205](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/205)).

  - Redefines `NonDetC` as a Church-encoded binary tree instead of a Church-encoded list ([#197](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/197)).

  - Removes the `OnceC` carrier for `Cull` effects, replacing it with the composition of `CullC` on some other `Alternative` carrier, e.g. `NonDetC` ([#204](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/204)).

  - Moves all the carriers into their own modules in the `Control.Carrier` namespace. Several have also been renamed, e.g. the various `Trace` carriers are all named `TraceC` within their separate modules, and should be imported qualified if disambiguation is required. This simplifies naming schemes, and ensures that the choice of e.g. strict or lazy carrier is always made consciously and expliclty, instead of defaulting to whichever is exported by the effect module ([#204](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/204)).

  - Removes the re-export of `Member` from all carrier modules, re-exporting `Has` in its place. `Has` constraints should generally be used instead, and specialist cases can import `Control.Effect.Sum` for `Member`. ([#217](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/217))

  - Redesigns & renames the handlers for church-encoded nondeterminism carriers to standardize naming and usage patterns. ([#207](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/207))
    - The primary handlers (`runChoose`, `runNonDet`, `runCut`, `runCull`) take multiple continuations.
    - Handlers which return an `Alternative` are suffixed with `A`, e.g. `runNonDetA`.
    - Handlers which return a `Monoid` are suffixed with `M`, e.g. `runNonDetM`.
    - Handlers which return a `Semigroup` are suffixed with `S`, e.g. `runChooseS`.

  - Removes `InterposeC` & `runInterpose` due to their inefficiency. They can be replaced with use of `InterpretC`/`runInterpret` for the desired effect. ([#223](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/223))

  - Removes `prj` from `Member`, as it was only used in `InterposeC` (see above), and was generally inadvisable due to its lack of modularity. ([#223](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/223))

  - Removes the `Resource` effect and carrier. Both have been relocated to `fused-effects-exceptions`. ([#268](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/268))

  - Redefines `Fail` as a synonym for `Throw String`. ([#247](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/247))

  - Removes `Resumable` and its carriers. Both have been relocated to `fused-effects-resumable`; they can also be usefully and flexibly replaced by arbitrary effects, `Lift`, and `InterpretC`. ([#269](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/269))

  - Changes `Control.Carrier.Fresh.Strict.runFresh` to take and return the initial & final values, respectively, allowing for safer operation. ([#267](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/267))

  - Removes `resetFresh`, as it was unsafe. Greater safety _and_ control over the generation of fresh values can be obtained by use of `runFresh`. ([#267](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/267))

  - Removes `PureC`; `Data.Functor.Identity.Identity` should be used instead. Note that `run` is still provided as a convenient synonym for `runIdentity`. ([#307](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/307))

  - Removes the `Pure` effect. It’s unlikely that this will require changes, as `Pure` had no operations, but `Lift Identity` should be used instead. ([#307](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/307))

  - Redefines the `Lift` effect, allowing inner contexts to run actions in outer contexts, e.g. to interoperate with `Control.Exception`. ([#306](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/306))

  - Removes `MonadUnliftIO` instances as they’ve been subsumed by the new definition of `Lift`. Additionally, the `ReaderT` & `IdentityT` types defined in `transformers` may be useful. ([#306](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/pull/306))


  # v0.5.0.1

  - Adds support for ghc 8.8.1.

  # v0.5.0.0

  - Derives `Generic1` instances for all non-existentially-quantified effect datatypes.

  - Derives `Foldable` & `Traversable` instances for `:+:`.

  - Defines `MonadFix` instances for all of the carriers.

  - Re-exports `run`, `:+:`, and `Member` from `Control.Effect.Carrier`, reducing the number of imports needed when defining new effects.

  - Re-exports `Carrier`, `Member`, and `run` from the various effect modules, reducing the number of imports needed when using existing effects.

  ## Backwards-incompatible changes

  - Replaces `runResource` with an equivalent function that uses `MonadUnliftIO` to select the correct unlifting function (a la `withResource`, which is removed in favor of `runResource`).

  - Changes the signature of `eff` from `sig m (m a) -> m a` to `sig m a -> m a`, requiring effects to hold `m k` in their continuation positions instead of merely `k`. This was done in order to improve interoperability with other presentations of higher-order syntax, e.g. `bound`; syntax used with `bound` can now be given `HFunctor` and `Carrier` instances.

    To upgrade effects used with previous versions, change any continuations from `k` to `m k`. If no existential type variables appear in the effect, you can derive `Generic1`, and thence `HFunctor` & `Effect` instances. Otherwise, implement the required instances by hand. Since continuation positions now occur in `m`, `hmap` definitions will have to apply the higher-order function to these as well.

  - Adds `Functor` constraints to `hmap` and `Monad` constraints to `handle`, allowing a greater variety of instances to be defined (e.g. for recursively-nested syntax).

  - Replaces the default definitions of `hmap` and `handle` with derivations based on `Generic1` instead of `Coercible`. Therefore, first-order effects wishing to derive these instances will require `Generic1` instances, presumably derived using `-XDeriveGeneric`.

  - Moves `send` from `Control.Effect.Sum` to `Control.Effect.Carrier`. Likewise removes the re-export of `send` from `Control.Effect`.

  - Deprecates `fmap'` in favour of `fmap`.

  - Deprecates `handlePure` in favour of `hmap`.

  # v0.4.0.0

  ## Backwards-incompatible changes

  - Removes APIs deprecated in 0.3.0.0, including `Eff`, `interpret`, `ret`, and the `handle*` family of helper functions.

  ## Other changes

  - Adds the ability to derive default instances of `HFunctor` and `Effect` for first-order effects, using the `-XDeriveAnyClass` extension.
  - Adds a generic `Interpose` effect that enables arbitrary "eavesdropping" on other effects.

  # 0.3.1.0

  - Improved speed of `Reader`, `State`, `Writer`, and `Pure` effects by defining and inlining auxiliary `Applicative` methods.
  - Adds `runInterpret` & `runInterpretState` handlers in `Control.Effect.Interpret` as a convenient way to experiment with effect handlers without defining a new carrier type and `Carrier` instance. Such handlers are somewhat less efficient than custom `Carrier`s, but allow for a smooth upgrade path when more efficiency is required.
  - Added `unliftio-core` as a dependency so as to provide a blessed API for unlift-style effects and a solution to the cubic-caller problem.

  # 0.3.0.0

  ## Backwards-incompatible changes

  - Adds `Monad` as a superclass of `Carrier`, obviating the need for a lot of constraints, and `Monad` instances for all carrier types.
    This is a backwards-incompatible change, as any carriers users have defined now require `Monad` instances. Note that in many cases carriers can be composed out of existing carriers and monad transformers, and thus these instances can often be derived using `-XGeneralizedNewtypeDeriving`. We also recommend compiling with `-Wredundant-constraints` as many of these can now be removed.
  - Replaces `AltC` with a new carrier, `NonDetC`, based on Ralf Hinze’s work in _[Deriving Backtracking Monad Transformers](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/ralf.hinze/publications/#P12)_.
    This is a backwards-incompatible change. `AltC` was equivalent to the `ListT` monad transformer, and had the same well-known limitation to commutative monads. Therefore, the elimination of `Eff` required a more durable approach.
  - Removes `Branch`.
    This is a backwards-incompatible change, but was necessitated by the difficulty of implementing correct `Applicative` & `Monad` instances for carriers which used it. Carriers which were employing `Branch` internally should be reimplemented using `NonDetC` or a similar approach; see `CutC` and `CullC` for examples.
  - Renames `Control.Effect.Void`, `Void`, and `VoidC` to `Control.Effect.Pure`, `Pure`, and `PureC` respectively.
    This is a backwards-incompatible change for code mentioning `VoidC`; it should be updated to reference `PureC` instead.

  ## Deprecations

  - `Eff` and `interpret`, in favour of computing directly in the carriers. This enables the compiler to perform significant optimizations; see the benchmarks for details.
     Handlers can simply remove the `Eff` wrapping the carrier type & any use of `interpret`. As above, we also recommend compiling with `-Wredundant-constraints` as many of these can now be removed.
  - `ret`, in favor of `pure` or `return`.
  - `handleEither`, `handleReader`, `handleState`, `handleSum`, and `handleTraversable` in favour of composing carrier types directly.
     Carriers can be composed from other carriers and `eff` defined with `handleCoercible`; and other definitions can use `handlePure` & `handle` directly.

  All deprecated APIs will be removed in the next release.

  ## Other changes

  - Adds a lazy `State` carrier in `Control.Effect.State.Lazy`
  - Rewrites `CutC` using an approach related to `NonDetC`, with the addition of a continuation to distinguish `empty` from `cutfail`.
  - Rewrites `CullC` using `ListC` and `ReaderC`.
  - Moves `OnceC` from `Control.Effect.NonDet` to `Control.Effect.Cull` to avoid cyclic dependencies.
  - Adds a `runCutAll` handler for `Cut` effects, returning a collection of all results.

  # 0.2.0.2

  - Loosens the bounds on QuickCheck to accommodate 2.x.

  # 0.2.0.1

  - Fixes the benchmarks, and builds them in CI to avoid regressing them again.

  # 0.2.0.0

  - Adds `listen`, `listens`, and `censor` operations to `Writer`.
  - Provides explicit type parameters to `run`-style functions in `State`, `Reader`, `Writer`, and `Error`.
    This is a backwards-incompatible change for clients using these functions in combination with visible type applications.
  - Adds benchmarks of `WriterC`/`VoidC` wrapped with `Eff` against their unwrapped counterparts.
  - Adds `Functor`, `Applicative`, and `Monad` instances for `WriterC`.
  - Adds `Functor`, `Applicative`, and `Monad` instances for `VoidC`.
  - Fixes a space leak with `WriterC`.
  - Removes the `Functor` constraint on `asks` and `gets`.
  - Adds `bracketOnError`, `finally`, and `onException` to `Resource`.
  - Adds `sendM` to `Lift`.

  # 0.1.2.1

  - Loosens the bounds on QuickCheck to accommodate 0.12.

  # 0.1.2.0

  - Adds support for ghc 8.6.2, courtesy of @jkachmar.
  - Adds a `Cut` effect which adds committed choice to nondeterminism.
  - Adds a `Cull` effect which adds pruning to nondeterminism.
  - Adds an example of using `NonDet`, `Cut`, and a character parser effect to define parsers.
  - Fixes the table of contents links in the README.

  # 0.1.1.0

  - Adds a `runNonDetOnce` handler which terminates immediately upon finding a solution.

  # 0.1.0.0

  Initial release.

  ## Overview

  `fused-effects` is an [effect system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_system) for Haskell that values expressivity, efficiency, and rigor. It provides an encoding of [algebraic](#algebraic-effects), [higher-order](#higher-order-effects) effects, includes a library of the most common effects, and generates efficient code by [fusing](#fusion) effect handlers through computations. It is suitable for use in hobbyist, research, and industrial contexts.

  Readers already familiar with effect systems may wish to start with the [usage](#usage) instead. For those interested, this [talk at Strange Loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfDazZfxlNs) outlines the history of and motivation behind effect systems and `fused-effects` itself.

  Setup, hidden from the rendered markdown.

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE ConstraintKinds, FlexibleInstances, GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving, MultiParamTypeClasses, UndecidableInstances #-}
  module Main (module Main) where

  import Control.Algebra
  import Control.Carrier.Lift
  import Control.Carrier.Reader
  import Control.Carrier.State.Strict
  import Control.Monad.IO.Class (liftIO)
  import qualified Control.Monad.State.Class as MTL

  main :: IO ()
  main = pure ()
  ```
  -->


  ### Algebraic effects

  In `fused-effects` and other systems with _algebraic_ (or, sometimes, _extensible_) effects, effectful programs are split into two parts: the specification (or _syntax_) of the actions to be performed, and the interpretation (or _semantics_) given to them.

  In `fused-effects`, _effect types_ provide syntax and _carrier types_ provide semantics. Effect types are datatypes with one constructor for each action, invoked using the `send` builtin. Carriers are monads, with an `Algebra` instance specifying how an effect’s constructors should be interpreted. Carriers can handle more than one effect, and multiple carriers can be defined for the same effect, corresponding to different interpreters for the effect’s syntax.


  ### Higher-order effects

  Unlike some other effect systems, `fused-effects` offers _higher-order_ (or _scoped_) effects in addition to first-order algebraic effects. In a strictly first-order algebraic effect system, operations like `local` or `catchError`, which specify some action limited to a given scope, must be implemented as interpreters, hard-coding their meaning in precisely the manner algebraic effects were designed to avoid. By specifying effects as higher-order functors, this limitation is removed, meaning that these operations admit a variety of interpretations. This means, for example, that you can introspect and redefine both the `local` and `ask` operations provided by the `Reader` effect, rather than solely `ask` (as is the case with certain formulations of algebraic effects).

  As Nicolas Wu et al. showed in _[Effect Handlers in Scope][]_, this has implications for the expressiveness of effect systems. It also has the benefit of making effect handling more consistent, since scoped operations are just syntax which can be interpreted like any other, and are thus simpler to reason about.


  ### Fusion

  In order to maximize efficiency, `fused-effects` applies _fusion laws_, avoiding the construction of intermediate representations of effectful computations between effect handlers. In fact, this is applied as far as the initial construction as well: there is no representation of the computation as a free monad parameterized by some syntax type. As such, `fused-effects` avoids the overhead associated with constructing and evaluating any underlying free or freer monad.

  Instead, computations are performed in a carrier type for the syntax, typically a monad wrapping further monads, via an instance of the `Carrier` class. This carrier is specific to the effect handler selected, but since it isn’t described until the handler is applied, the separation between specification and interpretation is maintained. Computations are written against an abstract effectful signature, and only specialized to some concrete carrier when their effects are interpreted.

  Since the interpretation of effects is written as a typeclass instance which `ghc` is eager to inline, performance is excellent: approximately on par with `mtl`.

  Finally, since the fusion of carrier algebras occurs as a result of the selection of the carriers, it doesn’t depend on complex `RULES` pragmas, making it easy to reason about and tune.


  ## Usage

  ### Package organization

  The `fused-effects` package is organized into two module hierarchies:
  * those under `Control.Effect`, which provide effects and functions that invoke these effects’ capabilities.
  * those under `Control.Carrier`, which provide carrier types capable of executing the effects described by a given effect type.

  An additional module, `Control.Algebra`, provides the `Algebra` interface that carrier types implement to provide an interpretation of a given effect. You shouldn’t need to import it unless you’re defining your own effects.


  ### Invoking effects

  Each module under the `Control.Effect` hierarchy provides a set of functions that invoke effects, each mapping to a constructor of the underlying effect type. These functions are similar to, but more powerful than, those provided by `mtl`. In this example, we invoke the `get` and `put` functions provided by `Control.Effect.State`, first extracting the state and then updating it with a new value:

  ```haskell
  action1 :: Has (State String) sig m => m ()
  action1 = get >>= \ s -> put ("hello, " ++ s)
  ```

  The `Has` constraint requires a given effect (here `State`) to be present in a _signature_ (`sig`), and relates that signature to be present in a carrier type (`m`). We generally, but not always, program against an abstract carrier type, usually called `m`, as carrier types always implement the `Monad` typeclass.

  To add effects to a given computation, add more `Has` constraints to the signature/carrier pair `sig` and `m`. For example, to add a `Reader` effect managing an `Int`, we would write:

  ```haskell
  action2 :: (Has (State String) sig m, Has (Reader Int) sig m) => m ()
  action2 = do
    i <- ask
    put (replicate i '!')
  ```


  ### Running effects

  Effects are run with _effect handlers_, specified as functions (generally starting with `run…`) unpacking some specific monad with a `Carrier` instance. For example, we can run a `State` computation using `runState`, imported from the `Control.Carrier.State.Strict` carrier module:

  ```haskell
  example1 :: (Algebra sig m, Effect sig) => [a] -> m (Int, ())
  example1 list = runState 0 $ do
    i <- get
    put (i + length list)
  ```

  `runState` returns a tuple of both the computed value (the `()`) and the final state (the `Int`), visible in the result of the returned computation. The `get` function is resolved with a visible type application, due to the fact that effects can contain more than one state type (in contrast with `mtl`’s `MonadState`, which limits the user to a single state type).

  Since this function returns a value in some carrier `m`, effect handlers can be chained to run multiple effects. Here, we get the list to compute the length of from a `Reader` effect:

  ```haskell
  example2 :: (Algebra sig m, Effect sig) => m (Int, ())
  example2 = runReader "hello" . runState 0 $ do
    list <- ask
    put (length (list :: String))
  ```

  (Note that the type annotation on `list` is necessary to disambiguate the requested value, since otherwise all the typechecker knows is that it’s an arbitrary `Foldable`. For more information, see the [comparison to `mtl`](#comparison-to-mtl).)

  When all effects have been handled, a computation’s final value can be extracted with `run`:

  ```haskell
  example3 :: (Int, ())
  example3 = run . runReader "hello" . runState 0 $ do
    list <- ask
    put (length (list :: String))
  ```

  `run` is itself actually an effect handler for the `Lift Identity` effect, whose only operation is to lift a result value into a computation.

  Alternatively, arbitrary `Monad`s can be embedded into effectful computations using the `Lift` effect. In this case, the underlying `Monad`ic computation can be extracted using `runM`. Here, we use the `MonadIO` instance for the `LiftC` carrier to lift `putStrLn` into the middle of our computation:

  ```haskell
  example4 :: IO (Int, ())
  example4 = runM . runReader "hello" . runState 0 $ do
    list <- ask
    liftIO (putStrLn list)
    put (length list)
  ```

  (Note that we no longer need to give a type annotation for `list`, since `putStrLn` constrains the type for us.)


  ### Required compiler extensions

  When defining your own effects, you may need `-XKindSignatures` if GHC cannot correctly infer the type of your handler; see the [documentation on common errors][common] for more information about this case. `-XDeriveGeneric` can be used with many first-order effects to derive default implementations of `HFunctor` and `Effect`.

  When defining carriers, you’ll need `-XTypeOperators` to declare a `Carrier` instance over (`:+:`), `-XFlexibleInstances` to loosen the conditions on the instance, `-XMultiParamTypeClasses` since `Carrier` takes two parameters, and `-XUndecidableInstances` to satisfy the coverage condition for this instance.

  [common]: https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects/blob/master/docs/common_errors.md

  The following invocation, taken from the teletype example, should suffice for most use or construction of effects and carriers:

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE DeriveFunctor, DeriveGeneric, FlexibleInstances, GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving, MultiParamTypeClasses, TypeOperators, UndecidableInstances #-}
  ```


  ### Defining new effects

  The process of defining new effects is outlined in [`docs/defining_effects.md`][], using the classic `Teletype` effect as an example.

  ### Contributed packages

  Though we aim to keep the `fused-effects` core minimal, we encourage the development of external `fused-effects`-compatible libraries. If you’ve written one that you’d like to be mentioned here, get in touch!

  * [`fused-effects-lens`][felens] provides combinators to use the [`lens`][lens] library fluently inside effectful computations.
  * [`fused-effects-exceptions`][exc] provides handlers for exceptions thrown in the `IO` monad.
  * [`fused-effects-resumable`][] provides resumable exceptions, which can also serve as a limited form of coroutines.
  * [`fused-effects-random`][] provides a `Random` effect integrated into a `fused-effects` stack.

  ### Comparison to other effect libraries

  #### Comparison to `mtl`

  Like [`mtl`][], `fused-effects` provides a library of monadic effects which can be given different interpretations. In `mtl` this is done by defining new instances of the typeclasses encoding the actions of the effect, e.g. `MonadState`. In `fused-effects`, this is done by defining new instances of the `Carrier` typeclass for the effect.

  Also like `mtl`, `fused-effects` allows scoped operations like `local` and `catchError` to be given different interpretations. As with first-order operations, `mtl` achieves this with a final tagless encoding via methods, whereas `fused-effects` achieves this with an initial algebra encoding via `Carrier` instances.

  Unlike `mtl`, effects are automatically available regardless of where they occur in the signature; in `mtl` this requires instances for all valid orderings of the transformers (O(n²) of them, in general).

  Also unlike `mtl`, there can be more than one `State` or `Reader` effect in a signature. This is a tradeoff: `mtl` is able to provide excellent type inference for effectful operations like `get`, since the functional dependencies can resolve the state type from the monad type. On the other hand, this behaviour can be recovered in `fused-effects` using `newtype` wrappers with phantom type parameters and helper functions, e.g.:

  ```haskell
  newtype Wrapper s m a = Wrapper { runWrapper :: m a }
    deriving (Applicative, Functor, Monad)

  instance Algebra sig m => Algebra sig (Wrapper s m) where
    alg = Wrapper . alg . handleCoercible

  getState :: Has (State s) sig m => Wrapper s m s
  getState = get
  ```

  Indeed, `Wrapper` can now be made an instance of `MonadState`:

  ```haskell
  instance Has (State s) sig m => MTL.MonadState s (Wrapper s m) where
    get = Control.Carrier.State.Strict.get
    put = Control.Carrier.State.Strict.put
  ```

  Thus, the approaches aren’t mutually exclusive; consumers are free to decide which approach makes the most sense for their situation.

  Unlike `fused-effects`, `mtl` provides a `ContT` monad transformer; however, it’s worth noting that many behaviours possible with delimited continuations (e.g. resumable exceptions) are directly encodable as effects.

  Finally, thanks to the fusion and inlining of carriers, `fused-effects` is only marginally slower than equivalent `mtl` code (see [benchmarks](#benchmarks)).

  [`mtl`]: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl


  #### Comparison to `freer-simple`

  Like [`freer-simple`][], `fused-effects` uses an initial encoding of library- and user-defined effects as syntax which can then be given different interpretations. In `freer-simple`, this is done with a family of interpreter functions (which cover a variety of needs, and which can be extended for more bespoke needs), whereas in `fused-effects` this is done with `Carrier` instances for `newtype`s.

  Unlike `fused-effects`, in `freer-simple`, scoped operations like `catchError` and `local` are implemented as interpreters, and can therefore not be given new interpretations.

  Unlike `freer-simple`, `fused-effects` has relatively little attention paid to compiler error messaging, which can make common (compile-time) errors somewhat more confusing to diagnose. Similarly, `freer-simple`’s family of interpreter functions can make the job of defining new effect handlers somewhat easier than in `fused-effects`. Further, `freer-simple` provides many of the same effects as `fused-effects`, plus a coroutine effect, but minus resource management and random generation.

  Finally, `fused-effects` has been [benchmarked](#benchmarks) as faster than `freer-simple`.

  #### Comparison to `polysemy`

  Like [`polysemy`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/polysemy), `fused-effects` is a batteries-included effect system capable of scoped, reinterpretable algebraic effects.

  As of GHC 8.8, `fused-effects` outperforms `polysemy`, though new effects take more code to define in `fused-effects` than `polysemy` (though the `Control.Effect.Interpret` effect is suitable for rapid prototyping of new effects). Like `freer-simple` and unlike `fused-effects`, polysemy provides custom type errors if a given effect invocation is ambigous or invalid in the current context.


  #### Comparison to `eff`

  [`eff`](https://github.com/lexi-lambda/eff) is similar in many ways to `fused-effects`, but is slightly more performant due to its representation of effects as typeclasses. This approach lets GHC generate better code in exchange for sacrificing the flexibility associated with effects represented as data types. `eff` also uses the `monad-control` package to lift effects between contexts rather than implementing an `Algebra`-style class itself.
