  # A library for making Monoid writing functions with variable number of parameters

  **Also known as: Holey monoids.**

  This library is made to be useful especially for library authors, who want to provide users
  with building blocks to create functions that compose a monoidal structure
  from their parameters in a type safe way. Think of `printf`.

  Imagine a library that let`s user create nicely formatted strings, with the ability to
  compose strings into larger strings and to allow the rendering of
  all sorts of values, for example `Double`s, `Bool`s, or lists to strings.

  **This library** allows the author of such a library to easily add the
  building blocks, allowing users to build **poly variadic functions**, i.e. with parameters
  depending on the order and composition of these building blocks.

  Several `FunctionBuilder` values sharing a common monoidal output type can be composed
  to a big `FunctionBuilder` value, in order to build an **output function** that
  has a flexible number and types of parameters depending, on the individual
  `FunctionBuilder`s used. This output function can be obtained by `toFunction`.

  `FunctionBuilder`s can also be composed via standard type classes.

  This module gives you ready-made  like `Functor`, `Applicative`, `Semigroup`, `Monoid` or Category` instances;

  The basic building blocks are `toFunction`, `immediate` and `addParameter`.

  For example, you could use this library to build a string formatting
  library, that allows users to compose arbitrary, _printf-style_ render **functions**
  from reusable building blocks, such that they can be re-combined in order to make
  get functions, that can be applied to parameters that fill place holders, like e.g.:

       renderCpuTemp :: Int -> Float -> String
       renderCpuTemp =
         toFunction (render "CPU " . renderInt . render " Temperature: " . renderFloat)
