  typalyze
  ~~~~~~~~

  Analyzes a Haskell source file and collects useful information about
  it, which is then output to stdout in a (hopefully) easy-to-parse
  format.

  The current incarnation just obtains information about types over
  source-spans.  The output describes spans of text in files which GHC
  considers to have the given type.  For example:

  src/Main.hs:55:49-54
    forall a. a -> IO a

  means that on line 55 of Main.hs, from column 49-54, whatever is in
  that region is considered to have type "forall a. a -> IO a".

  typalyze tries to be smart about packages and modules, and
  automatically attempts to identify the GHC options which will allow
  the file to be parsed and typechecked successfully.

  However, if this fails, you can supply some options to the program to
  help it along.  See the output of --help.

  typalyze.el
  ~~~~~~~~~~~

  Interacts with the typalyze program, which aides Haskell development.

  C-c C-a C-c   Analyze current buffer.
  C-c C-a C-t   Show type of thing at point.

  Also, typalyzes buffer whenever it is saved.

  hswatch
  ~~~~~~~

  Alternatively, an external program named 'hswatch' can take care of
  updating typalyze, on file modification, in the background.  To get
  this running in Emacs, type M-x hswatch and select the directory tree
  you want it to keep watch over.

  It requires 'inotify-tools' which only works on recent versions of the
  Linux kernel, 2.6.13+.
