  Version 0.2.1.0
  ---------------

  *Jan 20, 2018*

  <https://github.com/mstksg/type-combinators-singletons/releases/tag/v0.2.1.0>

  *   Added `singSome`/`someSing` and `singWit1`/`wit1Sing`, to convert between
      the *singletons* types `SomeSing` and `SingInstance` and their more generic
      representations in *type-combinators*, `Some Sing` and `Wit1 Sing`.

  Version 0.2.0.0
  ---------------

  *Jan 16, 2018*

  <https://github.com/mstksg/type-combinators-singletons/releases/tag/v0.2.0.0>

  *   Gathered together the many two-way conversion functions into a typeclass,
      `TC`.

  Version 0.1.0.0
  ---------------

  *Sep 1, 2017*

  <https://github.com/mstksg/type-combinators-singletons/releases/tag/v0.1.0.0>

  *   Initial release.

  type-combinator-singletons
  ==========================

  Conversions between data-types in *[type-combinators][]* and singletons from
  *[singletons][]* and orphan instances.

  [type-combinators]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/type-combinators
  [singletons]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/singletons

  There's a lot of overlap in functionality between the two libraries.  I often
  use both of them together side-by-side to do different things, but there is
  some friction the process of converting between the identical data types that
  both libraries have, and between similar typeclasses.  This library attempts to
  ease that friction by providing conversion functions between identical data
  types and also many of the appropriate orphan typeclass instances.
