  # type-level-show
  Utilities for writing `Show`-like type families i.e. instead of `showsPrec
  :: Int -> a -> ShowS`, we have `ShowsPrec :: Natural -> k -> Symbol`.

  Requires at least GHC 9.2 for the type-level `Symbol` manipulation.

  ## Why?
  [refined-hackage]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/refined
  [rerefined-hackage]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rerefined

  [refined][refined-hackage] fills out error messages using `TypeRep`s. My rewrite
  [rerefined][rerefined-hackage] allows you to use `Typeable` to fill out a
  predicate name, or you can do it yourself. But `TypeRep` is a pain to use, and
  it seems strange to do runtime work on type representations. Why can't we just
  do it on the type level?

  We _could_, but the problem is nice formatting. `Show` instances handle
  precedence, and the base library provides a bunch of handy utilities such as
  `showParen :: Bool -> ShowS -> ShowS`. Worse, I couldn't find a `ShowNat ::
  Natural -> Symbol` type family on Hoogle, which is a very simple type family
  that should certainly be lying around.

  This library intends to provide such utilities, so that rerefined can avoid
  `Typeable` altogether.

  Unsure if I'll provide a `ShowType`. Lower priority than the plain utilities.
