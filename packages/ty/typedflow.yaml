description: |-
  TypedFlow is a typed, higher-order frontend to TensorFlow and a high-level library for deep-learning.

  The main design principles are:

  - To make the parameters of layers explicit. This choice makes sharing of parameters explicit and allows to implement "layers" as pure functions.

  - To provide as precise as possible types. Functions are explicit about the shapes and elements of the tensors that they manipulate (they are often polymorphic in shapes and elements though.)

  - To let combinators be as transparent as possible. If a NN layers is a simple tensor transformation it will be exposed as such.
