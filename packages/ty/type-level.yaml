description: "type-level: Type-level programming library\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\n This
  library permits performing computations on the type-level. Type-level \n functions
  are implemented using functional dependencies of multi\n parameter type classes.
  \n\n To date, Booleans and Numerals (Naturals and Positives) are\n supported. With
  regard to Numerals, there is support for common\n arithmetic operations (addition,
  substraction, multiplication,\n division, exponientation, logarithm, maximum, comparison,
  GCD) \n over natural numbers (using a decimal representation to make \n compile-time
  errors friendlier).\n\n Although making use of type-level computations might seem
  devious and\n obfuscated at first sight, it is indeed useful in practice to implement
  \n lightweight dependent types such us number-parameterized types (e.g. an array
  \n type parameterized by the array's size or a modular group type Zn \n parameterized
  by the modulus).\n\n Here is a tutorial on type-level numerals and how to use them
  to\nimplement numerically-parameterized vectors: https://forsyde.ict.kth.se/trac/wiki/ForSyDe/Haskell/ForSyDeTutorial#FSVec\n\nDEPENDENCIES\n
  \n type-level depends on GHC (due to the use of Multiparameter Type Classes and
  \n infix type constructors) and Template Haskell\n\nINSTALLATION\n\nto install globally,
  for the whole system (requires admin permissions):\n\n$ ./Setup.hs configure\n$
  ./Setup.hs build\n$ ./Setup.hs haddock # generate documentation, optional, \n                     #
  requires Haddock > 2.0 due to the use of TH\n$ ./Setup.hs install\n\nto install
  locally and just for your own user:\n\n$ ./Setup.hs configure --prefix=The/selected/local/directory\n$
  ./Setup.hs build\n$ ./Setup.hs haddock  # generate documentation, optional, \n                      #
  requires Haddock > 2.0 due to the use of TH\n\n$ ./Setup.hs install --user\n"
