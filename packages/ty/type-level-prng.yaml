  # type-level-prng
  Type level pseudorandom number generators.
  Ever wanted convenient access to randomness in your type-level Haskell programs?
  Trick question, I don't care, you can now have it anyway.

  Due to the specific limitations of GHC's opaque type-level natural numbers,
  the PRNGs defined here have wildly different performance.
  This library provides defunctionalized symbols, so that your
  type-level programs can be parameterized on their PRNG implementation.
