  # typed-process-effectful

  ## Description

  An alternative `Process` effect for the [`effectful`][effectful] ecosystem.
  While to the `Process` effect shipped with the `effectful` library is based on
  the [`process`][process] package this implementation relies on
  [`typed-process`][typed-process] instead.

  ## How to use

  The functions exposed by the `Effectful.Process.Typed` module are those from
  [`System.Process.Typed`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/typed-process-0.2.6.1/docs/System-Process-Typed.html)
  with the notable difference that they have a `TypedProcess :> es` constraint.
  Use `runTypedProcess` to handle the effect and eliminate the constraint.

  ```haskell
  import Effectful.Monad
  import Effectful.Process.Typed

  main :: IO ()
  main = runEff . runTypedProcess $ true

  true :: TypedProcess :> es => Eff es ()
  true = Effectful.Process.Typed.runProcess_ $ shell "true"
  ```
