  # Type of html static

  This little companion library of
  [https://hackage.haskell.org/package/type-of-html](Type of html)
  provides just two little functions:
  `static :: Document a => a -> Q Exp`.
  Using this template haskell function on any part of your html
  document will escape, render and lift to a Symbol at compile time.

  It increases performance a lot by avoiding any runtime computation.
  By producing Proxy Symbol, it will fuse at compiletime with adjacent
  elements in your document.

  `optimize :: Q Exp -> Q Exp` takes a quoted definition of a html
  document and tries to convert all literals to compile time escaped
  Proxy Symbol.  It is less powerfull than `static` but more convenient.
