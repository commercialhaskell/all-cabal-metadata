description: |-
  For a certain class of programs, type-level let is essential
  in order to be able to write these programs in such a way
  that they do not result in ghc core that is quadratic in
  size. Type-level let is not explicitly supported in ghc,
  but we can encode it. The @typelet@ library provides a
  type-checker plugin that makes the encoding more convenient
  to use as well as more effective.
