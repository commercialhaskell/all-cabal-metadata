description: |-
  The range library alows the use of performant and versatile ranges in your code.
  It supports bounded and unbounded ranges, ranges in a nested manner (like library
  versions), an efficient algebra of range computation and even a simplified interface
  for ranges for the common cases. This library is far more efficient than using the
  default Data.List functions to approximate range behaviour. Performance is the major
  value offering of this library.

  If this is your first time using this library it is highly recommended that you start
  with "Data.Range.Typed"; it contains the basics of this library that meet most use
  cases.
