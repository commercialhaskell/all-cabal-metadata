  ## Dedication

  ## Overview

  How much do you hate programming at the type level, but only being able to use
  lists? A million? *Two* million? Some mathematicians suspect that there may be
  even larger degrees of hate.

  Enter `type-sets`. They're sets... at the type-level! Check this:

  ```haskell
  {-# OPTIONS_GHC -fplugin=Type.Compare.Plugin #-}

  import Type.Set

  type MySet = Insert Bool (Insert String (Insert (Maybe Int) 'Empty))

  test1 :: Proxy (Member Bool MySet) -> Proxy 'True
  test1 = id  -- Bool is a member :)

  test2 :: Proxy (Member Char MySet) -> Proxy 'False
  test2 = id  -- Char is not a member :(
  ```

  See the `Type.Set` module for more operations.

  But wait, there's more! There's also a proof-of-concept `Type.Set.Variant` for
  describing open-sums indexed by type-sets. PRs to make it better would be
  greatly appreciated!

  One love.

  including the original idea, help with the implementation, infinite amounts of
  coffee, and a couch to sleep on while it was being made.
