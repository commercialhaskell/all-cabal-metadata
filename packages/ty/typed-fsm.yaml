  # Revision history for typed-fsm

  ## 0.3.0.1-- 2024-8-04
  * Fix getSomeOperateSing remvoe (SingKind ts) Constraint

  ## 0.3.0.0-- 2024-7-25
  * Remove the SingI constraints from SomeMsg and AnyMsg.
  * Modify the definition of LiftM and remove the SingI constraints.
  * RunOperate and runOp both remove the SingI constraints.
  * Reason for doing this: When explaining Ast, constraints can be easily converted into proofs, but proofs seem difficult to convert into constraints.

  ## 0.2.0.1-- 2024-7-22

  * Fix getSomeOperateSing
  * Improve runOperate

description: |-
  FSM stands for [Finite State Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine).
  The typed-fsm is used to define and execute FSM.

  Advantages of type-fsm:

  * Focus on the right message.
  * Top-to-bottom design for easy refactoring.
  * Conducive to building complex state machine systems:
  ** Type guarantees will not produce incorrect function calls when written.
  ** With the help of the type system, we can define many state processing functions and then call each other recursively with confidence.
  * There is a sanity check. If you miss some items for pattern matching, the compiler will issue a warning, and there will also be a warning for invalid items.
