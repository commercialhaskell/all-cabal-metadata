changelog-type: markdown
description: |-
  FSM stands for [Finite State Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine).
  The typed-fsm is used to define and execute FSM.

  Advantages of type-fsm:

  * Focus on the right message.
  * Top-to-bottom design for easy refactoring.
  * Conducive to building complex state machine systems:
  ** Type guarantees will not produce incorrect function calls when written.
  ** With the help of the type system, we can define many state processing functions and then call each other recursively with confidence.
  * There is a sanity check. If you miss some items for pattern matching, the compiler will issue a warning, and there will also be a warning for invalid items.
