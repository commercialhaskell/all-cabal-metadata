changelog: "# Changelog for typed-encoding\n\n## Anticipated future breaking changes\n\n-
  `Data.TypedEncoding.Internal.Class.IsStringR` expected to be be changed / replaced\n-
  (post 0.3) \"enc-B64\" will be moved to a different package (more distant goal)\n-
  Improved constrains in `Data.TypedEncoding.Conv` modules\n\n## 0.4.1\n\n- Code Changes.
  Backward compatible\n   - changed order in `IsSuperset` definition to speed up compilation
  of of more common cases (there is a small chance that it impacts GHC error messages)\n
  \  - Faster \"r-UTF8\", possible issue is changed error message in case ByteString
  is invalid.\n   - Deprecated 'validFromEnc' for its confusing name\n   - Deprecated
  `runDecodings` in favor of consistently named `runDecodings'`\n   - Deprecated `runDecoding`
  in favor of consistently named `runDecoding'`\n   - Deprecated `runValidation` in
  favor of consistently named `runValidation'`\n\n- Documentation / code comment fixes
  and improvements.\n\n- New functionality `validRFromEnc'` replacing 'validFromEnc'
  confusing name\n  - `propCompEncoding` property\n  - `propSupersetCheck` property\n
  \ - `propSafeDecoding'` properties\n  - `propSafeValidatedDecoding` properties\n
  \ - `IsEnc` type family and `Encoding` constraint\n  - `getUncheckedPayload` function\n
  \ - `pack` and `unpack` overloads in `Data.TypedEncoding.Conv.ByteString.Char8`\n\n-
  Fixes\n  - corrected `propEncodesInto'` property test specification\n\n\n## 0.4\n\n-
  Breaking \n  - IsSupersetOpen type family type arguments have changed\n\n- Potentially
  Breaking  \n  (These changes should be backward compatible in almost all cases):\n
  \ - Stronger (more precise) constraints on all functions `Data.TypedEncoding.Conv`\n
  \ - Compilation errors emitted from `IsSuperset` are different\n  - \"r-ban\" now
  only allows ASCII chars in annotation name, errors-out otherwise\n   \n- New\n  -
  `\"r-CHAR8\"` phantom restriction and `Superset` modified for \"r-CHAR8\"\n  - `\"r-UNICODE.D76\"`
  /text/ character set restriction and `Superset` modifications\n  - `Superset` constraint
  added back (different than in 0.2)\n  - properties for `Superset` testing\n  - `\"r-ByteRep\"`
  annotation used as a marker of low level use of `Char` instead of `Word8` for `ByteString`
  work.\n\n- Improved:\n  - `Data.TypedEncoding.Conv` `Text`, `String` and `ByteString`
  conversions are now more type safe and less error prone.\n    Conversion functions
  are reversible, A to B to C diagrams commute.\n\n- Fixes:\n  - `Data.TypedEncoding.Instances.Restriction.BoundedAlphaNums`
  `\"r-ban\"` now verifies `Superset \"r-ASCII\"`\n  \n## 0.3.0.2\n\n- Added documentation
  to `Data.TypedEncoding.Conv` outlining current limitations, challenges of conversions.\n-
  Improved readme\n\n\n## 0.3.0.1\n\n- Documentation changes / corrections\n- New
  _doctest_ tests\n- Haddock coverage and @since flags\n\n## 0.3\n\n- Breaking: Numerous
  changes on the implementation side, new version should be largely compatible on
  the call site except\n    for small differences in constraints and order for type
  variables (if `-XTypeApplications` is used).\n    See [v3 migration guide](https://github.com/rpeszek/typed-encoding/blob/master/doc/v3ConversionGuide.md).\n
  \ - `EncodeFAll`, `DecodeFAll`, `RecreateFAll`, `EncodeF`, `DecodeF`, `RecreateF`
  replaced with\n     `EncodeAll`, `DecodeAll`, `ValidateAll`, `Encode`, `Decode`,
  `Validate`.\n  - functions used to create encoding instances or encoding combinators
  (e.g. `implEncodeP`) are now more precisely typed\n  - `Displ String` instance (used
  in examples, has been made consistent with Text and ByteString)\n  - Modules under
  `Data.TypedEncoding.Combinators` merged into `Data.TypedEncoding.Instances`.\n  -
  Modules under `Data.TypedEncoding.Internal` have been reorganized and moved outside
  of `Internal`. Various  changes that make the library easier to navigate. \n    for
  better navigation and discovery.\n  - some previously exported combinators (e.g.
  `implTranF`) have moved to `Data.TypedEncoding.Instances.Support.Unsafe` \n  - `ToEncString`,
  `FromEncString` have more type variables and function name but backward compatible
  functions\n    have been provided.  \n  - `Superset` typeclass removed, replaced
  with `IsSuperset` type family.\n  - Minor changes in `forall` variable order in
  combinators for `\"r-bool:\"` encodings.\n  - `Encoder` type removed, replaced by
  `Encodings`.\n  - `checkWithValidationsEnc` combinator renamed to `check`\n  - (Considered
  private) `MkCheckedEnc` constructor became `UnsafeMkCheckedEnc`\n  - (Considered
  private) `MkEnc` constructor became `UnsafeMkEnc`\n \n- new functionality\n  - new
  types and typeclasses are based on both encoding name and algorithm name allowing\n
  \   typeclass definitions for open encodings like `\"r-ban:\"` that can contain
  arbitrary symbol literals. \n  - new set of combinators grouped into `_` (compiler
  decided algorithm), `'` (program specifies algorithm), and\n    `algorithm name
  ~ encoding name` categories  \n  - `above` combinator subsumes partial encoding
  / decoding combinators \n  - `EncodingSuperset` class added\n\n\n## 0.2.2 \n\n-
  Next version (0.3) will have number of breaking changes, some rethinking and a lot
  of cleanup,\n  this version preps for some of that (see section above)\n- Fixes\n

  annotation to encodeAll and decodeAll\n\n## 0.2.0.0\n\n- breaking:\n  - Data.TypedEncoding.Instances
  modules reorganized\n  - Data.TypedEncoding.Internal.Class modules reorganized\n
  \ - Data.TypedEncoding.Internal.Utils module renamed\n  - Several TypeAnnotations
  friendly changes:\n      * Removed polymorphic kinds in most places\n      * Changed
  typeclass name from `Subset` to `Superset`\n      * flipped type parameters on FlattenAs,
  HasA typeclass functions\n      * Removed Proxy parameters from several methods

description: "# typed-encoding\nType level annotations, string transformations, and
  other goodies that make programming strings safer.\n\n## Motivation\nI have recently
  spent a lot of time troubleshooting various `Base64`, `quoted-printable`, and `UTF-8`
  encoding issues.  \nI decided to write a library that will help avoiding issues
  like these.\n\nThis library allows to specify and work with types like\n\n```Haskell\n--
  some data encoded in base 64\nmydata :: Enc '[\"enc-B64\"] ByteString\n\n-- some
  text (utf8) data encoded in base 64 \nmyData :: Enc '[\"enc-B64\", \"r-UTF8\"] ByteString\n```\n\nIt
  allows to define precise string content annotations like:\n\n```Haskell\nipaddr
  :: Enc '[\"r-IpV4\"] Text\n```\n\nand provides ways for \n\n- encoding\n- decoding\n-
  recreation (encoding validation)\n- type conversions\n- converting types to encoded
  strings\n- typesafe conversion of encoded strings to types\n\n... but this approach
  seems to be a bit more...\n\n```Haskell\n-- upper cased text encoded as base64\nexample
  :: Enc '[\"enc-B64\", \"do-UPPER\"] () T.Text\nexample = encodeAll . toEncoding
  () $ \"some text goes here\"\n```\n\nIt becomes a type directed, declarative approach
  to string transformations.\n\nTransformations can be\n\n- used with parameters\n-
  applied or undone partially (if encoding is reversible)\n\nOne of more interesting
  uses of this library are encoding restrictions.   \n(Arbitrary) bounded alpha-numeric
  (`\"r-ban\"`) restrictions \nand a simple annotation Boolean algebra are both provided.\n\n```Haskell\nphone
  :: Enc '[\"r-ban:999-999-9999\"] () T.Text\nphone = ...\n\n-- simple boolean algebra:\nphone'
  :: Enc '[\"boolOr:(r-ban:999-999-9999)(r-ban:(999) 999-9999)\"] () T.Text\nphone'
  = ...\n```\n\n## Goals and limitations\n\nThe main goal is to provide improved type
  safety for programs that use string encodings and \ntransformations.  _Not to provide
  encoding implementation type safety_. \n_Encoding and string manipulation libraries
  are typically well established and tested, type safety is really needed at the usage
  site, not at the implementation site_.\n\nThis library approach is to fight issues
  with (value level) strings using (type level) strings. Using `Symbol`-s effectively
  forces us to play the orphan instances game.   \nOne of the long term goals is for
  this library to provide combinator alternatives to typeclass polymorphism so that
  the orphan instances are more of a convenience and not the necessity.  \n\n\n##
  Examples \n\nPlease see `Examples.TypedEncoding` it the module list.\n\n\n## Other
  encoding packages\n\nMy approach will be to write specific encodings (e.g. _HTTP_)
  or wrap encodings from other packages using separate \"bridge\" projects.\n\nCurrently
  /typed-encoding/ depends on\n\n- /base64-bytestring/ because it was my driving example,
  this is likely to move out to a separate bridge project at some point. \n\nBridge
  work:\n\n- [typed-encoding-encoding](https://github.com/rpeszek/typed-encoding-encoding)
  bridges [encoding](https://github.com/dmwit/encoding) package\n\n## News \n\n- v0.3
  has numerous changes and improvements. \n\n## Tested with\n\n- stack (1.9.3) lts-14.27
  (ghc-8.6.5)\n- needs ghc >= 8.2.2, base >=4.10 for GHC.TypeLits support\n\n## Known
  issues\n\n- running test suite: cabal has problems with doctest, use stack  \n   https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/6087
