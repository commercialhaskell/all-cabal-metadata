  Mock any `Typeable` function or expression anywhere.

  A common approach to mocking in Haskell is with type classes, with instances for the real and test logic. Typeable-mock fills a niche for the projects that do not use granular type classes so much. It lets you mock any `Typeable` expression in context of nearly any monad. It works in a monad of a concrete type or a polymorphic one with class constraints.

  ```haskell
  -- Use mock in application. Here `useMock` is a user-written helper that
  -- is aware of the application context and can look up mocks in there.
  useMock "writeFile" writeFile >>= \f -> liftIO (f path contents)

  -- Declare mock in test.
  writeFileMock <- makeMock "writeFile"
    ((\_ _ -> pure ()) :: FilePath -> String -> IO ())

  -- Check assertions
  assertHasCalls
    [ expectCall "/tmp/1.txt" "Hello world",
      expectCall AnyVal (PredicateVal $ elem "Hello" . words)
    ]
    writeFileMock
  ```
