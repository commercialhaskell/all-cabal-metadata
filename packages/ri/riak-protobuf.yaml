  # Welcome to riak-protobuf

  This library is a set of Haskell types for the protocol buffers API to the
  [Riak](http://www.basho.com/Riak.html) decentralized data store.

  # Generating `.hs` files

  Haskell modules are generated manually as follows:

  `./generate-proto.sh`

  # Join in!

  We are happy to receive bug reports, fixes, documentation enhancements,
  and other improvements.
