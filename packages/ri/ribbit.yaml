  \   - [The name: Ribbit](#the-name-ribbit)\n\nRibbit is yet another type safe relational
  database\nlibrary for Haskell, heavily inspired by the amazing\n[Servant](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant)
  library. The goal\nis to create a type-level language for defining table schemas
  \"as a type\",\nqueries that operate on those schemas, and, tangentially, \"backends\"
  that\ncan do something useful with those types like talk to an actual database.\n\n\nUsing
  Ribbit, you might expect to see something like this:\n\n```haskell\ntype PeopleTable
  =\n  Field \"id\" Int\n  :> Field \"name\" Text\n  :> Field \"age\" Int\n  \n\ntype
  MyQuery = Select '[\"id\", \"name\"] `From` PeopleTable `Where` \"age\" `Equals`
  (?)\n\nmatchingPeople <-\n  query\n    dbConn\n    (Proxy :: Proxy MyQuery)\n    (Only
  21) -- argument that fills in the (?) placeholder\n\n  :: IO [Only Int :> Only Text]\n\n```\n\n##
  Status\n\nThe status of Ribbit \"Very Incomplete\". My goal is to take a \"depth\nfirst\"
  approach, where every feature added is production ready\nbefore moving on to the
  next feature. Featured back-ends include\n[postgresql-simple](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/postgresql-simple)\nat
  this time.\n\n### Current Features\n\nThese are the features that are currently
  implemented.\n\n#### Basic @Select .. From ..\n\nWe support queries of the form:\n\n```haskell\ntype
  MyQuery = Select '[\"field1\", \"field2\"] `From` MyTable\n```\n\n#### Cross product\n\nWe
  support queries of the form:\n\n```haskell\ntype MyQuery = Select '[\"t1.field1\",
  \"t2.field2\"] `From` MyTable1 `As` \"t1\" `X` MyTable2 `As` \"t2\"\n```\n\n####
  Conditionals\n\nWe support queries of the form:\n\n```haskell\ntype MyQuery = Select
  '[\"field1\", \"field2\"] `From` MyTable `Where` <condition>\n```\n\nWhere ```<condition>```
  can include:\n\n- ```a `And` b```: Basic intersection.\n- ```a `Or` b```: Basic
  union.\n- ```\"field\" `Equals` (?)```: Test for equality. This introduces a query
  parameter that must be supplied at runtime.\n- ```\"field1\" `Equals` \"field2\"```:
  Test the equality of two fields (that both must exist in the schema)\n- ```a `Lt`
  b```: Less than operator.\n- ```a `Lte` b```: Less than or equal to operator.\n-
  ```a `Gt` b```: Greater than operator.\n- ```a `Gte` b```: Greater than or equal
  to operator.\n- ```Not a```: Not operator.\n- ```\"field\" `NotEquals` (?)```: Test
  for inequality against a query parameter.\n- ```\"field1\" `NotEquals` \"field2\"```:
  Test for inequality between two fields.\n\n#### Limited `CREATE TABLE` support.\n\nThe
  postgresql-simple backend supports creating tables in the\ndatabase. This support
  is \"limited\" because it misses the following\nfeatures:\n\n- PostgreSQL column
  types are know for only a small number of Haskell types.\n  This is extensible by
  the user (by implementing a type class), but it would\n  be nice to have a more
  comprehensive set of mappings out of the box.\n\n- Foreign key constraints are not
  yet supported.\n\n- Arbitrary non-primary-key indexes are not yet supported.\n\nWhat
  *IS* supported already is:\n\n- Determining whether a field is nullable, based on
  whether the corresponding\n  Haskell type is wrapped in a `Maybe`.\n\n- Compound
  primary keys. I.e. primary keys consisting of more than one\n  component.\n\n\n##
  Roadmap\n\nThis is what I plan to work on next:\n\n### `INSERT INTO` support.\n\nObviously,
  we want to do more with our DB than just read from it.\n\n### Flesh out Haskell
  to PostgreSQL type mapping.\n\nAs mentioned above, only a small number of Haskell
  types are mapped\nto PostgreSQL types out of the box. We would like to make this
  a more\ncomprehensive mapping out of the box.\n\n## How it compares with other libraries.\n\nThe
  short answer is there are a lot of other libraries and I'm not sure.\nPersistent
  and esquelleto are ones I've used, but if you search \"relational\" or\n\"sql\"
  in Hackage there seems to be a lot of other options. Part of the goals\nfor this
  library are to flesh out this approach myself, so I can have a better\ncontext for
  understanding everything else available. In other words, it is part\nresearch project.
  With that in mind, there are at least a couple of specific\ngoals I have in mind:\n\n-
  Avoid template Haskell. Persistent is amazing, but the use of Template\n  Haskell
  makes certain things difficult, like documenting (or for large\n  projects even
  understanding) everything that is produced by the Template\n  Haskell.\n\n- Make
  the language easy to understand. If you have some basic SQL knowledge,\n  it should
  be immediately obvious what is going on even if you are a beginner\n  Haskeller.\n\n-
  Try to make as much stuff happen at the type level as possible. The ability\n  to
  write your own type classes or type families over Servant API types is, I feel,\n
  \ part of what makes Servant so amazing. I want to replicate that success here.\n
  \ So, for instance, if someone somewhere defines a schema type that looks like\n
  \ this:\n\n  ```haskell\n  type MySchema =\n    Field \"id\" Int\n    :> Field \"name\"
  Text\n    :> Field \"address\" (Maybe Text)\n  ```\n\n  Then you would be free to
  deconstruct this type (using type families),\n  transform it into another schema,
  generate customized `CREATE TABLE`\n  statements if the (forthcoming) ones provided
  aren't good enough for your\n  back-end or use case... that sort of thing. As a
  somewhat contrived example:\n  maybe, for who knows what reason, you never want
  to allow null values in your\n  database. You can write a type family that can inspect
  every field in an\n  arbitrary schema, replacing all the `Maybe a` with just `a`,
  like:\n\n  ```haskell\n  -- With -XPolyKinds\n  type family NoNulls schema where\n
  \   NoNulls (Field name (Maybe typ)) = Field name typ\n    NoNulls (a :> b) = NoNulls
  a :> NoNulls b\n    NoNulls a = a\n\n  NoNulls MySchema \n  -- Same as:\n  --   Field
  \"id\" Int\n  --   :> Field \"name\" Text\n  --   :> Field \"address\" Text <---
  note the lack of Maybe\n  ```\n\n\n## The name: Ribbit\n\nThe name means nothing
  except I kindof like the sound of it. There are so many\n\"sql\", \"relational\",
  \"query\", etc. package names already that I didn't want to:\n\n1) get lost in the
  mix.\n2) step on anyone's toes by choosing too similar a name.\n3) create confusion
  by seeming to be associated with some other package with\n   which I am not.\n\n"
