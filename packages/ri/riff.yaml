description: "# RIFF for Haskell\n\n[RIFF][2] has been around for a long time and
  I thought that now would be a\ngood time to write a library for it in Haskell. This
  library supports reading most RIFF\nfiles. Example file formats (taken from Wikipedia
  and elsewhere) that use RIFF as the \ncontainer layer include:\n\n - WAV (Windows
  audio)\n - AVI (Windows audiovisual)\n - RMI (Windows \"RIFF MIDIfile\")\n - CDR
  (CorelDRAW vector graphics file)\n - ANI (Animated Windows cursors)\n - DLS (Downloadable
  Sounds)\n - WebP (An image format developed by Google)\n - XMA (Microsoft Xbox 360
  console audio format based on WMA Pro)\n\nAnd there are many more. You can even
  come up with your own data that can be contained\ninside RIFF.\n\n## Getting the
  Code\n\nYou can just rely upon the library in your cabal files. The [code is on
  Hackage][3].\n\n## Building the Code\n\nTo build the code:\n\n    $ cabal sandbox
  init\n    $ cabal install\n\nAnd that is all that there is to it.\n\n## Bundled
  Executables\n\nI have written a few simple programs just so that I could test out
  the code that I have written:\n\n    $ cabal run riff-structure # prints out the
  internal structure of a RIFF file\n    $ cabal run riff-convert # lets you convert
  files to and from RIFF and RIFX formats\n    $ cabal run riff-identity # the identity
  over RIFF files, useful for testing\n\nFeel free to use any of these executables
  to have a play with the RIFF file format, or better yet,\nwrite some code using
  this library and let me know about it.\n\n## Example Data\n\nYou can find example
  data all over the internet. Any WAVE file is a RIFF file for example.\nHere is a
  list of example data that you may be able to download:\n\n - [John Loomis Examples][1]\n\n\n
