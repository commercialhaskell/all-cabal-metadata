  # advent-of-code-ocr

  "OCR" letter recognition for [Advent of Code][aoc] puzzles, compatible with all
  puzzles from 2015 to 2019.  Also comes with a handy command line utility to
  parse the ASCII art directly from stdin:

  [aoc]: https://adventofcode.com

  ```
  $ cat abc.txt
  .##..###...##.
  #..#.#..#.#..#
  #..#.###..#...
  ####.#..#.#...
  #..#.#..#.#..#
  #..#.###...##.
  $ cat abc.txt | advent-of-code-ocr
  ABC
  ```

  ## Installation

  To use as a library, add *advent-of-code-ocr* as a hackage dependency like you
  would any other.

  To use as an executable:

  ```bash
  # using stack
  stack install advent-of-code-ocr
  # using cabal
  cabal install advent-of-code-ocr
  # from source
  git clone https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-ocr
  cd advent-of-code-ocr
  cabal install     # or stack install
  ```

  ## Compatibility

  Should be compatible with all challenges from 2015 to 2019.  However, I have
  only tested it with:


  *   2016 Day 8
  *   2018 Day 10
  *   2019 Day 8
  *   2019 Day 11

  And it is possible I have missed some.  If you notice any I am missing, please
  let me know!
