  Changelog
  =========

  Version 0.2.4.1
  ---------------

  *November 21, 2019*

  <https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-api/releases/tag/v0.2.4.1>

  *   Export `DayInt` and `_DayInt` from *Advent* module

  Version 0.2.4.0
  ---------------

  *November 21, 2019*

  <https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-api/releases/tag/v0.2.4.0>

  *   Fixed caching behavior and documentation to reflect that Day 25 actually
      does have 2 stars, like normal.
  *   Some extra smart constructors for moving between `Day` and `Integer`, in
      the form of a `Prism` and a pattern synonym.

  Version 0.2.3.0
  ---------------

  *November 21, 2019*

  <https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-api/releases/tag/v0.2.3.0>

  *   Add API commands for daily and global leaderboards.
  *   In the process, the Servant API is reshuffled a bit: `Articles` has been
      generalized to `HTMLTags "article"`, to also support `HTMLTags "div"`.
      `FromArticle` is now `FromTags "article"`.
  *   Move some of the data types to be in their own module, *Advent.Types*.

  Version 0.2.2.1
  ---------------

  *November 19, 2019*

  <https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-api/releases/tag/v0.2.2.1>

  *   Fixed prompt parser that would fail on 2016 Day 2 Part 2 because of a
      malformed `<span>...</title>` tag pair in the prompt HTML

  Version 0.2.2.0
  ---------------

  *November 9, 2019*

  <https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-api/releases/tag/v0.2.2.0>

  Version 0.2.1.0
  ---------------

  *November 5, 2019*

  <https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-api/releases/tag/v0.2.1.0>

  Version 0.2.0.0
  ---------------

  *November 4, 2019*

  <https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-api/releases/tag/v0.2.0.0>

  *   Switch from libcurl to servant, which allows for shedding of external
      dependencies.
  *   Support leaderboard API with data type.
  *   Expose raw servant API and client functions, for those who want to build
      documentation or a mock server or low-level client.

  Version 0.1.2.X
  ---------------

  *   *December 8, 2018*: *BUGFIX* Switched from *taggy* to *tagsoup*, after observing that *taggy*

  ======================

  [![advent-of-code-api on Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/advent-of-code-api.svg?maxAge=86400)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/advent-of-code-api)
  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mstksg/advent-of-code-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mstksg/advent-of-code-api)

  Haskell bindings for Advent of Code REST API.  Caches and throttles requests
  automatically, and parses responses into meaningful data types.

  [advent-of-code-api]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/advent-of-code-api

  Specify your requests with `AoC` and `AoCOpts`, and run them with
  `runAoC`.

  Examples:

  ```haskell
  -- Fetch prompts for day 5
  runAoC myOpts $ AoCPrompt (mkDay_ 5)

  -- Fetch input for day 8
  runAoC myOpts $ AoCInput (mkDay_ 8)

  -- Submit answer "hello" for Day 10, Part 1
  runAoC myOpts $ AoCSubmit (mkDay_ 10) Part1 "hello"
  ```

  Please use responsibly.  All actions are rate-limited to a default of one
  request every three seconds, with ability to adjust up to as fast as a
  hard-coded limit of one request per second.

  The neatly exported bindings (handling cookies/authentication, cacheing,
  throttling) are in *Advent*.

  Session Keys
  ------------

  Session keys are required for most commands, but if you enter a bogus key
  you should be able to get at least Part 1 from `AoCPrompt`.  Session keys are
  also not needed for daily and global leaderboards.

  The session key can be found by logging in on a web client and checking
  the cookies.  You can usually check these with in-browser developer
  tools.

  Servant API
  -----------

  A Servant API (for integrating with *servant* for features like mock servers,
  documentation and low-level client methods) is also exported in *Advent.API*.
  The Servant API also parses into meaningful types, but lacks management of
  cookies/auth, cacheing, and throttling.  Please use especially responsibly.
