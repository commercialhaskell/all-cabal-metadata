  Important: Install with
  @cabal install --extra-include-dirs \/usr\/local\/include\/assimp\/@
  Of course use the location of the include files on your system.

  This library provides FFI bindings to the Assimp asset import
  library. It requires Assimp to already be installed. For more
  information about Assimp see the assimp website at
  <http://assimp.sourceforge.net/>.

  This release corresponds to Assimp 2.0. When this package stabilizes I
  intend to track new releases of Assimp by also releasing new versions with
  the same version number, but this should be considered a beta release.
  Importing models is currently working. Textures and animations are
  untested.

  Here is a sample program that imports a scene and then outputs the
  information contained in it.

  > module Main where
  >
  > import System (getArgs)
  > import Graphics.Formats.Assimp
  >
  > -- Defines the preprocessing we want assimp to perform
  > processing = [ CalcTangentSpace
  >              , Triangulate
  >              , JoinIdenticalVertices
  >              , SortByPType
  >              ]
  >
  > main = do
  >   args <- getArgs
  >   scene <- importFile (head args) processing
  >   print scene                   -- Outputs all information in the scene
  >   getVersionMajor >>= print     -- Print the major version of assimp
  >   getVersionMinor >>= print     -- Print the minor version of assimp
  >   getVersionRevision >>= print  -- Print the version revision of assimp
