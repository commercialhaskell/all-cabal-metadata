synopsis: Run IO operations asynchronously and wait for their results
changelog: |
  ## Changes in 2.2.4:

   - Support for GHC 9.2

  ## Changes in 2.2.3:

   - Documentation fixes

  ## Changes in 2.2.2:

   - Builds with GHC 8.6.x
   - linkOnly and link2Only are now exported
   - wait now has the same behaviour with BlockedIndefinitelyOnSTM as waitCatch
   - Documentation fixes

  ## Changes in 2.2.1:

   - Add a Hashable instance for Async
   - Bump upper bounds
   - Documentation updates

  ## Changes in 2.2:
   - cancel now throws AsyncCancelled instead of ThreadKilled
   - link and link2 now wrap exceptions in ExceptionInLinkedThread when
     throwing to the linked thread. ExceptionInLinkedThread is a child
     of AsyncException in the exception hierarchy, so this maintains the
     invariant that exceptions thrown asynchronously should be
     AsyncExceptions.
   - link and link2 do not propagate AsyncCancelled, so it's now
     possible to cancel a linked thread without cancelling yourself.
   - Added linkOnly and link2Only to specify which exceptions should be
     propagated,if you want something other than the default behaviour
     of ignoring AsyncCancelled.
   - new utility function compareAsyncs for comparing Asyncs of
     different types.
   - Add a `Hashable` instance for `Async a`

  ## Changes in 2.1.1.1:
   - Make 'cancelWith' wait for the cancelled thread to terminate, like 'cancel'
   - Updates to dependency bounds for GHC 8.2

  ## Changes in 2.1.1:

   - Add `concurrently_`
   - Add `replicateConcurrently`
   - Add `replicateConcurrently_`
   - Fix incorrect argument order in `forConcurrently_`
   - Generalize `mapConcurrently_` and `forConcurrently_` to `Foldable`
   - `withAsync` now reliably kills the thread, by using an
     uninterruptible cancel
   - Make `cancel` wait for the thread to finish, and adjust
     'concurrently' to match

  ## Changes in 2.1.0:

   - Bump base dependency to allow 4.10
   - Remove invalid Monad instance for `Concurrently`
   - Add `Monoid` and `Semigroup` instances for `Concurrently`
   - Add `forConcurrently` (flipped version of `mapConcurrently`)
   - Add STM version of all applicable IO functions:
     `waitAnySTM`, `waitAnyCatchSTM`, `waitEitherSTM`,
     `waitEitherCatchSTM`, `waitEitherSTM_`, and `waitBothSTM`.

  ## Changes in 2.0.2:

   - Add a Monad instance for `Concurrently`
   - Bump base dependency to allow 4.9

  ## Changes in 2.0.1.6:

   - Add workaround to waitCatch for #14

  ## Changes in 2.0.1.5:

   - Bump `base` dependencies for GHC 7.8

  ## Changes in 2.0.1.4:

   - Bump `base` dependency of test suite

  ## Changes in 2.0.1.3:

   - Bump `base` dependency to allow 4.6

  ## Changes in 2.0.1.2:

   - Bump `stm` dependency to 2.4

  ## Changes in 2.0.1.1:

   - Safe Haskell support: `Control.Concurrent.Async` is now `Trustworthy`

  ## Changes in 2.0.1.0:

   - Added a `Functor` instance for `Async`
   - Added `asyncBound`, `asyncOn`, `asyncWithUnmask`, `asyncOnWithUnmask`, `withAsyncBound`, `withAsyncOn`, `withAsyncWithUnmask`, `withAsyncOnWithUnmask`.
   - Added `mapConcurrently`
   - Added `Concurrently` (with `Applicative` and `Alternative` instances)

description: |-
  This package provides a higher-level interface over
  threads, in which an @Async a@ is a concurrent
  thread that will eventually deliver a value of
  type @a@.  The package provides ways to create
  @Async@ computations, wait for their results, and
  cancel them.

  Using @Async@ is safer than using threads in two
  ways:

  * When waiting for a thread to return a result,
  if the thread dies with an exception then the
  caller must either re-throw the exception
  ('wait') or handle it ('waitCatch'); the
  exception cannot be ignored.

  * The API makes it possible to build a tree of
  threads that are automatically killed when
  their parent dies (see 'withAsync').
