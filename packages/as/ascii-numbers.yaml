  ### 1.2.0.2 (2025-01-20)

  Version bumps

  ### 1.2.0.1 (2023-06-26)

  Raise language to GHC2021

  ### 1.2.0.0 (2023-02-28)

  Support `ascii-superset-1.3`. This removes the `Lift` instances, as the
  `Lift` class has been removed from `ascii-superset`.

  ### 1.1.0.2 (2023-01-02)

  Minor Cabal correction (change `extra-doc-files` to `extra-source-files`)

  ### 1.1.0.1 (2022-12-30)

  Metadata changes only

  ### 1.1.0.0 (2022-04-20)

  Removed dependency on `d10`. The `D10` type from the `d10` module is replaced
  with the new `Digit` type instead. This type better semantically represents an
  ASCII character rather than an abstract 0-9 number, and this allows us to more
  confidently define instances for it that befit its ASCII meaning. The
  constructor names now have the full word `Digit` in them rather than `D`, which
  is consistent with the constructor names in `ASCII.Char` and
  `ASCII.Hexadecimal`.

  Renamed `D16` to `Word4`. This is now defined in a separate module,
  `ASCII.Word4`. The constructors are renamed from `D...` to `Number...`. The
  `Word4` type might someday belong in a separate package, because the concept can
  exist separately from ASCII.

  Added `Lift` instances:

  ```haskell
  instance DigitSuperset       x => Lift Digit     x
  instance DigitStringSuperset x => Lift [Digit]   x
  instance HexCharSuperset     x => Lift HexChar   x
  instance HexStringSuperset   x => Lift [HexChar] x
  ```

  ### 1.0.0.0 (2022-03-24)
