description: |-
  The <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/async async> library
  provides a higher-level interface over threads, allowing users to
  conveniently run IO operations asynchronously and wait for their
  results. This package is a reimplementation of async using the
  @MonadConc@ abstraction from
  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/concurrency concurrency>, providing
  easy-to-use asynchronous operaitons within an easily-testable
  framework.

  This library itself is tested with
  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dejafu dejafu>.

  When these functions are used in an IO context, the behaviour should
  appear identical to the original async package.
