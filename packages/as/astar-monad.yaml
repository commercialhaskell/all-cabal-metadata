description: "A\\* Monad\n=========\n\n[Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/astar-monad)\n\n**Caveat
  Emptor**; this hasn't been *battle-tested* yet; it should work, but make sure to
  test it out if you're doing anything serious.\n\nEasily do [A\\* searches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)
  with use of arbitrary monadic effects!\n\n> A* Search is widely used in pathfinding
  and graph traversal, which is the process of finding a path between multiple points,
  called \"nodes\".\n> A* can be used to find optimal paths for any problem with an
  appropriate heuristic cost-measure.\n\n## Basics\n\n* Use `<|>` or `asum` (anything
  using `Alternative`) to branch into multiple possible choices.\n* Use `estimate
  myCost` to **set** the value of your 'heuristic' function for the current branch.
  Do this whenever you've done enough work to change your estimate.  Remember that
  A\\* heuristics should always be pessimistic (e.g. can over-estimate cost, but shouldn't
  UNDER estimate). \n* Use `spend myCost` to **add** a cost to the branch's CUMULATIVE
  cost. Do this when some cost has been incurred, e.g. we've moved the state from
  one node to another.\n* Every call to `spend` or `estimate` creates a branch; Branches
  with LOWER costs will run before those with higher costs. Note that this branching
  is expensive, so try to consolidate calls to these functions in your actions when
  possible.\n* Call `done mySolution` to short circuit ALL running branches and immediately
  return your result.\n* `AStarT` has a built-in State monad which can store branch-local
  states for you. You can store your current branch's solution-space for instance,
  or the path you've followed to get to the current solution; or both!\n\nHere's an
  example of using A\\* to find a path to a location in a 2 dimensional grid.\n\n```haskell\n--
  Track which moves we've made, up, down, left or right\ndata Move = U | D | L | R\n
  \   deriving (Show, Eq)\n\n-- Track our current position, the goal we're moving
  towards, and the locations we've crossed along the way.\ndata Context =\n    Context
  { _current   :: (Int, Int)\n            , _goal      :: (Int, Int)\n            ,
  _locations :: [(Int, Int)]\n            }\n    deriving (Show, Eq)\nmakeLenses ''Context\n\n--
  The Manhattan distance between two points serves as our heuristic estimate.\n--
  It's *conservative*; it may cost MORE than this, but it won't cost LESS\ndistanceTo
  :: (Int, Int) -> (Int, Int) -> Int\ndistanceTo (x, y) (x', y') = abs (x - x') +
  abs (y - y')\n\n-- To make things more interesting we'll say that moving through
  coordinates\n-- where either 'x' or 'y' are divisible by the other is 3X more expensive!\naddCost
  :: MonadAStar (Sum Int) r m => (Int, Int) -> m ()\n-- Don't divide by zero!\naddCost
  (0, _) = spend 1\naddCost (_, 0) = spend 1\naddCost (x, y)\n    | mod x y == 0 ||
  mod y x == 0 = spend 3\naddCost _ = spend 1\n\n-- Move around the space looking
  for the destination point.\nmineField :: AStar Context (Sum Int) (Int, Int) ()\nmineField
  = do\n    -- Get the current position\n    (x, y) <- use current\n    -- Add the
  current location to our list\n    locations <>= [(x, y)]\n    -- If we're at the
  goal we're done!\n    gl <- use goal\n    when ((x, y) == gl)\n      $ done gl\n
  \   -- Add the cost of the current position\n    addCost (x, y)\n    -- Estimate
  steps to completion\n    estimate . Sum $ distanceTo gl (x, y)\n    asum\n        [
  move L >> mineField\n        , move R >> mineField\n        , move U >> mineField\n
  \       , move D >> mineField\n        ]\n\n-- We only care about the ending state,
  so we use `execAStar`\n-- `runAStarT` is the most powerful and runs a monad-transformer
  version\n-- and returns both the state and result type.\nrun :: Maybe Context\nrun
  = execAStar findPoint\n             Context { _current = (5, 5)\n                     ,
  _goal    = (7, 4)\n                     , _moves   = []\n                     }\n\n--
  Execute it to see if we found a solution; \n-- We only care about the state, so
  we use 'execAStar' it returns the state of the the 'winning' branch.\n--\n-- We
  can see from the results that the optimal path with these costs involves a bit of
  moving around to avoid coordinates which divide each other!\n>>> execAStar mineField
  (context (1, 1) (3, 4))\nJust (Context\n      { _current   = (3, 4)\n      , _goal
  \     = (3, 4)\n      , _locations = \n          [(1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3),
  (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4)]\n      })\n\n```\n"
