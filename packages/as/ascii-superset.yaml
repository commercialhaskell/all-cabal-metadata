description: |-
  This package defines classes which describe what subset of a type
  is valid as ASCII, as well as a type constructor representing a
  value of a superset that is known to be valid ASCII.

  It also defines the Lift class, which provides a polymorphic lift
  operation that can be used to convert characters and strings into
  types that support a larger set of characters.
