changelog: |
  ### 1.0.1.15 (2022-01-02)

  Minor Cabal correction (change `extra-doc-files` to `extra-source-files`)

  ### 1.0.1.14 (2022-12-30)

  Metadata changes only

  ### 1.0.1.13 (2022-04-20)

  Drop support for `base` 4.11 (GHC 8.4) and `base` 4.12 (GHC 8.6)

  Modify documentation on the `Lift` class. Previously it indicated that the class
  was for converting ASCII into supersets of ASCII. The class's purpose is now
  restated as being a conversion from any character set to any other larger
  character set. The purpose is to indicate that the ASCII subset types defined in
  the `ascii-numbers` package may reasonably have `Lift` instances.

  ### 1.0.1.12 (2022-03-22)

  Switch test-suite over to `hedgehog`

  ### 1.0.0.10 (2022-01-09)

  Support GHC 9.2

  ### 1.0.1.8 (2021-11-13)

  Support `hashable-1.4`

  ### 1.0.1.6 (2021-09-26)

  Add a test suite

  Raise `text` lower bound to `1.2.3`

  ### 1.0.1.4 (2021-02-10)

  Support GHC 9.0

  ### 1.0.1.2 (2021-02-09)

  Support `bytestring-0.11`

  ### 1.0.1.0 (2021-01-27)

  New functions:

    - `convertCharOrFail`
    - `convertStringMaybe`
    - `convertStringOrFail`
    - `convertCharMaybe`

  ### 1.0.0.4 (2021-01-25)

  Add some comments

description: |
  This package defines classes which describe what subset of a type is valid as
  ASCII, as well as a type constructor representing a value of a superset that is
  known to be valid ASCII.

  It also defines the `Lift` class, which provides a polymorphic lift operation
  that can be used to convert characters and strings into types that support a
  larger set of characters.
