  # `kind-generics-th`: Template Haskell support for generating `GenericK` instances

  This package provides Template Haskell functionality to automatically derive
  `GenericK` instances. Currently, this only supports the version of `GenericK`
  as found in the `kind-generics` library. (The `GenericK` class found in
  `kind-generics-sop` is not supported at the moment.)

  ## How to use this library

  To derive instances of `GenericK` for a data type, simply pass the Template
  Haskell–quoted `Name` of the type to the `deriveGenericK` function, as in the
  following example:

  ```haskell
  $(deriveGenericK ''Either)
  ```

  If you wish to pass a data family instance, one can pass the name of a
  constructor belonging to the particular family instance, such as in the
  following example:

  ```haskell
  data family Foo a b
  data instance Foo Int b = MkFooInt b

  $(deriveGenericK 'MkFooInt)
  ```

  You will likely need to enable most of these language extensions in order for
  GHC to accept the generated code:

  * `DataKinds`
  * `EmptyCase` (if using an empty data type)
  * `FlexibleInstances`
  * `MultiParamTypeClasses`
  * `PolyKinds` (if using a poly-kinded data type)
  * `TemplateHaskell`
  * `TypeFamilies`

  ## How many `GenericK` instances are generated

  `deriveGenericK` typically generates multiple `GenericK` instances per data
  type, as there is one `GenericK` instance per partial application of a data
  type constructor. For instance, `$(deriveGenericK ''Either)` will generate
  three `GenericK` instances:

  ```haskell
  instance GenericK (Either a b) where ...
  instance GenericK (Either a)   where ...
  instance GenericK Either       where ...
  ```

  Not every data type can be partially applied all the way in this fashion,
  however. Some notable counterexamples are:

  1. Data family instances. In the following example:

     ```haskell
     data family Bar a b
     data instance Bar a a = MkBar a
     ```

     One cannot partially apply to `Bar a a` to simply `Bar a`, so
     `$(deriveGenericK 'MkBar)` will only generate a single instance for
     `GenericK (Bar a a)`.
  2. Dependent kinds. `kind-generics` is not currently capable of representing
     data types such as the following in their full generality:

     ```haskell
     data Baz k (a :: k)
     ```

     Because the `k` type variable is used in the kind of `a` (i.e., it is used
     in a visible, dependent fashion). As a consequence,
     `$(deriveGenericK ''Baz)` will only generate the following instances:

     * `instance GenericK (Baz k a)`
     * `instance GenericK (Baz k)  `
  3. Data types with type family applications. In the following example:

     ```haskell
     type family Fam a
     newtype WrappedFam a = WrapFam (Fam a)
     ```

     It is impossible to write a `GenericK` instance for a partial application
     of `WrappedFam`, since the representation type would necessarily need to
     partially apply `Fam`, which GHC does not permit. Therefore,
     `$(deriveGenericK ''WrappedFam)` will only generate a single instance for
     `GenericK (WrappedFam a)`.

     There are some uses of type families that are not supported altogether.
     For instance, if a type family is applied to an _existentially_ quantified
     type variable, as in the following example:

     ```haskell
     data ExFam where
       MkExFam :: forall a. Fam a -> ExFam
     ```

     Representing `ExFam` would fundamentally require a partial application of
     `Fam`, as `type RepK ExFam = Exists * (Field (Fam :$: Var0))`. As a result,
     it is impossible to give `ExFam` a `GenericK` instance.

     Note that not all type families are problematic. For instance:

     ```haskell
     type family Fam2 :: * -> *
     newtype WrappedFam2 a = WrapFam2 (Fam2 a)
     ```

     In this example, `Fam2` is perfectly fine to partially apply, so
     `$(deriveGenericK ''WrappedFam2)` will generate two instances (as opposed
     to just one, as was the case for `WrappedFam`).

  ## Limitations

  `kind-generics` is capable of representing a wide variety of data types. The
  Template Haskell machinery in this library makes a best-effort attempt to
  automate the creation of most of these instances, but there are a handful of
  corner cases that it does not handle well. This section documents all of the
  known limitations of `deriveGenericK`:

  1. Data constructors with rank-_n_ field types (e.g., `(forall a. a -> a)`)
     are currently not supported.
  2. Data constructors with unlifted field types (e.g., `Int#` or `(# Bool #)`)
     are unlikely to work.
  3. GADTs that make use of certain forms of kind equalities are currently not
     supported. For example:

     ```haskell
     data Quux (a :: k) where
       MkQuux :: forall (a :: *). Maybe a -> Quux a
     ```

     If one were to rewrite `Quux` to make the existential quantification
     explicit, it would look like this:

     ```haskell
     data Quux (a :: k) =
       forall (a' :: *). (k ~ Type, a' ~~ a) => MkQuux (Maybe a')
     ```

     Therefore, we ought to get a `GenericK` instance like this:

     ```haskell
     instance GenericK (Quux :: k -> *) where
       type RepK (Quux :: k -> *) =
         Exists *
           ((Kon (k ~ Type) :&: (Var0 :~~: Var1)) :=>: Field (Maybe :$: Var0))
       ...
     ```

     Devising an algorithm that converts the original GADT definition of `Quux`
     into the explicitly existential form is not straightforward, however. In
     particular, `deriveGenericK` only detects the `k ~ *` part correctly at the
     moment, so it will generate an ill kinded instance for `Quux`.
