  # Revision history for directory-contents

  ## 0.2.0.2

  * Loosen version bounds

  ## 0.2.0.1

  * Create test data rather than relying on fixtures, since it's hard to include these fixtures when using cabal sdist.

  ## 0.2.0.0

  * Add `Data.Data` instance for `DirTree` and `Symlink`
  * Add `System.Directory.Contents.Zipper` for convenient navigation and modification of directory contents
  * Add more examples to readme
  * Breaking change: `DirTree_Dir` and `Symlink_External` child nodes are now stored as a `Map`
  * Fix: buildDirTree fails as a file gets deleted quickly.

  ## 0.1.0.0

  * Build recursive directory trees and try to avoid symlink cycles. Includes functions to walk a directory tree, filter it, and display it.

  Recursively list, operate on, and navigate the contents of a directory while
  avoiding symlink loops.

  Description
  -----------

  Modeled after the linux `tree` command (when invoked with the follow-symlinks
  option), this module recursively lists the contents of a directory while
  avoiding symlink loops. In particular, `tree -l` and `buildDirTree` should
  provide the same result. See the documentation of `buildDirTree` for an
  example.

  In addition to building the directory-contents tree, this module provides
  facilities for filtering, displaying, and navigating the directory hierarchy.

  Example
  -------

  ```haskell

  >
  > import Data.Foldable as F
  > import Data.List
  > import qualified Data.Text as T
  > import System.Directory.Contents
  > import System.Directory.Contents.Zipper
  > import System.FilePath
  >
  > main :: IO ()
  > main = do

  ```
  Building a directory tree is easy. Just call `buildDirTree` on a path of your
  choice. It'll recursively enumerate the contents of the directories. If it
  encounters symlinks, it'll follow those symlinks if it hasn't yet encountered
  the target of the symlink. If it has, it'll store a reference to that
  already-seen target.

  ```haskell

  >   mp <- buildDirTree "."
  >   case mp of
  >     Nothing -> putStrLn "Couldn't find that path."
  >     Just p -> do

  ```
  Once you've got a `DirTree` you can fmap, traverse, filter, or
  [wither](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/witherable-class) it to transform
  it however you like.

  Note that the filtering operations generally do not remove empty directories.
  You have to call `pruneDirTree` to do that.

  ```haskell

  >       let f = pruneDirTree =<< filterDirTree ((`elem` [".hs", ".lhs"]) . takeExtension) p
  >       putStrLn $ case f of
  >         Nothing -> "No haskell source files found."
  >         Just hs -> unlines
  >           [ "Paths that contain haskell source files:"
  >           , T.unpack $ drawDirTree hs
  >           , ""
  >           , "Haskell source files:"
  >           , intercalate ", " $ F.toList hs
  >           ]

  ```

  You can also use the provided `DirZipper` to browse your directory hierarchy and make
  changes wherever you like.

  ```haskell

  >       let printFocused =  maybe
  >             (putStrLn "Couldn't find navigation target")
  >             (printDirTree . focused)
  >
  >       putStrLn "Navigating down to src/System/Directory:"
  >       printFocused $
  >         downTo "Directory" =<< downTo "System" =<< downTo "src" (zipped p)
  >
  >       putStrLn "Navigating using a path containing \"..\":"
  >       printFocused $
  >           followRelative "./src/../src/System/Directory" (zipped p)
  >
  >       putStrLn "Removing the src/System directory. The src folder is now empty"
  >       putStrLn "(note that this doesn't change the actual files):"
  >       printFocused $
  >         remove =<< followRelative "./src/System" (zipped p)
  >
