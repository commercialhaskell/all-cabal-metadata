  # 0.2.1

  - Fix `listContentsRecFold` to not mask exceptions unnecessarily which could cause hangups. The `getDirectoryContentsRecursive` gets the fix as well
  - Make `closeDirStream` hold on to the stream so it’s not GC’ed prematurely causing errors on reads.

  # 0.2

  - New function for listing directory contents recursively `getDirectoryContentsRecursive`
  - New function for defining custom recursive directory traversals `listContentsRecFold`
  - `readDirStream` now returns file type in addition to basename
  - `DirStream` is now safe to close multiple times and it will be automatically closed by GC when it becomes unreachable
  - The `FileType` type now has only 3 constructors, symlink status is now field of some of them

  # 0.1.0.3

  - Lower `base` minimum required base to 4.12 (GHC 8.6). Minimum
    supported `unix` is still 2.8 because of `OsString`

  # 0.1.0.2

  - Fix compatibility with `filepath-1.5`

  # 0.1.0.1

  - Add missing test inputs

  # 0.1

  # Synopsis

  Reading of directory contents in constant memory, i.e. in an iterative
  fashion without storing all directory elements in memory. From another
  perspective, this reading interface allows stopping at any point
  without loading every directory element.

  Also defines general-purpose recursive directory traversals.

  Both Windows and Unix systems are supported.
