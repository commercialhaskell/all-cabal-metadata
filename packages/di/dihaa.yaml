  # Revision history for dihaa

  ## 0.2.1.2  -- 2017-05-06

  * Added link for haddock documentation to README.md.

  ## 0.2.1.1  -- 2017-05-06

  * First version to be released on hackage.
  * Fixed rendering of cross sections with adjacent arrow heads.
  * Moved most documentation to haddock of Main and expanded it with
    more detailed information.

  ## 0.2.1.0  -- 2017-05-03

  * Search for font in data dir instead of current directory.
    Basically that means now you can finally dihaa from anywhere after
    installation.

  ## 0.2.0.0  -- 2017-05-01

  * Added colors for boxes.

  ## 0.1.0.0

  * Development versions never formally released.

  dihaa -- Creating Diagrams from ASCII Art
  =========================================

  *dihaa* is a tool to create pictures of diagrams from ASCII art:

      This is an simple example of valid dihaa input:

                                            +----------------+
                                       +--->| PNG Image File |
      +-------------+      +-------+   |    +----------------+
      | Text Source +----->| dihaa +---+
      +-------------+      +-------+   |    +-------------------+
                               ^       +--->| UTF-8 Box Drawing |
      Commandline Options -----+            +-------------------+


  Building
  --------

  *dihaa* is written in Haskell and can be build using cabal.  I
  recommend using a sandbox for building the dependencies (Rasterific is
  used for image creation) and dihaa it self:

      cabal sandbox init
      cabal install


  Usage
  -----

  To process the text input call *dihaa* with either `-p` to create a
  PNG image or `-u` to create UTF-8 output using unicode box drawing
  elements.  Try `.cabal-sandbox/bin/dihaa -p test.dihaa`, his will
  create `test.dihaa.png`.

  For more details refer to the haddoc documentation of
  [Main](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dihaa/docs/dihaa/Main.html).


  Acknowledgment
  --------------

  This tool is inspired by: https://github.com/stathissideris/ditaa
  which currently has far more features than *dihaa*.
