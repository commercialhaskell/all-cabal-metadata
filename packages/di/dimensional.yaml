changelog: |
  1.4 (2021-05)
  -------------
  * Add `calorie` to `NonSI`.
  * Remove deprecated `AutoDeriveTypeable` pragmas. This means that `Typable` instances are no provided on GHC prior to 8.2.

  1.3 (2018-12)
  -------------
  * Breaking: Changed the `Show` instances for `UnitName`, `Unit`, `SQuantity` to use non-breaking spaces
    within unit names and between values and their units.
  * Bumped exact-pi dependency to < 0.6.
  * Added the dimensionless unit `percent`.
  * Added dimensionless wrappers for `log1p`, `expm1`, `log1pexp`, and `log1mexp` from the `Floating` class.

  1.2 (2018-11)
  -------------
  * Add `NoStarIsType` extension and import `Data.Kind.Type` for [GHC 8.6 compitbility](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/05721788de9ab6538def68c3c2c9dec50c9f24a8/proposals/0020-no-type-in-type.rst). Abandon compatibility with GHC < 8.

  1.1 (2018-03)
  -------------
  * Added `Semigroup` instances for [GHC 8.4 compatibility](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Migration/8.4#SemigroupMonoidsuperclasses).
  * Breaking: Renamed `Root` type family to `NRoot`. Added `Sqrt` and `Cbrt` type
    synonyms. Added `sqrt` and `cbrt` for term level dimensions.
  * Breaking: Changed `Numeric.Units.Dimensional.Prelude` to export dimensionally
    typed `signum`, `recip`, and `logBase` instead of the ones from `Prelude`.
  * Breaking: Changed `Numeric.Units.Dimensional.Prelude` to export `(.)` and `id`
    from `Control.Category` instead of from `Prelude`.
  * Breaking: Created a `product` function which take the product of a foldable structure of
    `Dimensionless` values. Exported this `product` function from Numeric.Units.Dimensional.Prelude
    instead of the one from `Prelude`.
  * Breaking: Changed the `HasDimension` typeclass to require an instance of the new
    `HasDynamicDimension` typeclass.
  * Breaking: Added operators for `AnyUnit` to the Numeric.Units.Dimensional.Dynamic
    module which may cause name collisions.
  * Breaking: Added dynamic versions of `(*~)`, `(/~)`, and `siUnit` to the Numeric.Units.Dimensional.Dynamic
    module which may cause name collisions.
  * Breaking: Removed exports of `nMeter`, `nSecond`, `kilo`, etc from Numeric.Units.Dimensional.UnitNames.
    Access these instead by inspecting the relevant units or prefixes.
  * Breaking: Generalized the type of `dimensionlessLength` from
    `(Num a, Foldable f) => f (Dimensional v d a) -> Dimensionless a)` to
    `(Num a, Foldable f) => f b -> Dimensionless a`. This provides a weaker constraint on the type `a`
    and may result in ambiguous types in code that depends on the former less general type.
  * Fixed a bug in the definition of the `inHg_NIST`.
  * Fixed a bug in the interchange name of the Dalton.
  * Added units for the US survey foot, yard, inch, mil, and mile.
  * Added the short ton as a unit of mass.
  * Clarified that the UCUM acre is based on the US survey foot.
  * Added a version of the acre based on the international foot.
  * Added `Data`, `Generic`, `Typeable` and `NFData` instances for many ancillary types.
  * Added `unQuantity` to the Coercion module to ease unwrapping without
    introducing ambiguous type variables.
  * Created explicit representation of metric `Prefix`es.
  * Added a multiplicative `Monoid` instance for `AnyQuantity` and for `AnyUnit`.
  * Added the `DynQuantity` type to represent possibly valid quantities of statically
    unknown dimension, suitable for performing arithmetic with such quantities.
  * Added `nroot` function for term-level dimensions.
  * Added the Numeric.Units.Dimensional.Float module with convenient wrappers around functions
    from RealFloat and IEEE for inspecting floating point quantities.
  * Added an `AEq` instance for `Quantity`.
  * Added `Eq1` and `Ord1` instances for `Quantity`.
  * Exposed the name of an 'AnyUnit' without promoting it to a 'Unit' first.
  * Exposed a way to convert atomic 'UnitName's back into 'NameAtom's.
  * Added the `btu`, a unit of energy.
  * Added the `gauss`, a unit of magnetic flux density.
  * Added the `angstrom`, a unit of length.
  * Relocated git repository to https://github.com/bjornbm/dimensional

  # dimensional

  This library provides statically-checked dimensional arithmetic for physical quantities, using the 7 SI base dimensions.

  Data kinds and closed type families provide a flexible, safe, and discoverable implementation that leads to largely self-documenting
  client code.

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bjornbm/dimensional.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bjornbm/dimensional)
  [![Hackage Version](http://img.shields.io/hackage/v/dimensional.svg)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/dimensional)
  [![Stackage version](https://www.stackage.org/package/dimensional/badge/lts?label=Stackage)](https://www.stackage.org/package/dimensional)

  ## Usage

  Simply importing `Numeric.Units.Dimensional.Prelude` provides access to dimensional arithmetic opertors, SI units and other common units
  accepted for use with the SI, and convenient aliases for quantities with commonly used dimensions.

  The `Unit d a` type represents a unit with dimension `d`, whose conversion factor to the coherent SI base unit of the corresponding dimension
  is represented by a value of type `a`. `a` is commonly chosen to be `Double`, but can be any `Floating` type. Where possible, support is also
  provided for `Fractional` or `Num` values.

  Similarly, the `Quantity d a` type represents a quantity with dimension `d`, whose numeric value is of type `a`. Aliases allow the use of, e.g.,
  `Length Double` to mean `Quantity DLength Double`. A complete list of available aliases is given in the haddock documentation for the
  `Numeric.Units.Dimensional.Quantities`.

  In the example below, we will solve a simple word problem.

  A car travels at 60 kilometers per hour for one mile, at 50 kph for one mile,
  at 40 kph for one mile, and at 30 kph for one mile. How many minutes does the journey take?
  What is the average speed of the car? How many seconds does the journey take, rounded up to the next whole second?

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE NoImplicitPrelude #-}

  module ReadmeExample where

  import Numeric.Units.Dimensional.Prelude
  import Numeric.Units.Dimensional.NonSI (mile)

  leg :: Length Double
  leg = 1 *~ mile -- *~ combines a raw number and a unit to form a quantity

  speeds :: [Velocity Double]
  speeds = [60, 50, 40, 30] *~~ (kilo meter / hour)
    -- *~~ does the same thing for a whole Functor at once
    -- Parentheses are required around unit expressions that are comingled with *~, /~, *~~, or /~~ operations

  timeOfJourney :: Time Double
  timeOfJourney = sum $ fmap (leg /) speeds
    -- We can use dimensional versions of ordinary functions like / and sum to combine quantities

  averageSpeed :: Velocity Double
  averageSpeed = _4 * leg / timeOfJourney
    -- _4 is an alias for the dimensionless number 4

  wholeSeconds :: Integer
  wholeSeconds = ceiling $ timeOfJourney /~ second
    -- /~ lets us recover a raw number from a quantity and a unit in which it should be expressed

  main :: IO ()
  main = do
           putStrLn $ "Length of journey is: " ++ showIn minute timeOfJourney
           putStrLn $ "Average speed is: " ++ showIn (mile / hour) averageSpeed
           putStrLn $ "If we don't want to be explicit about units, the show instance uses the SI basis: " ++ show averageSpeed
           putStrLn $ "The journey requires " ++ show wholeSeconds ++ " seconds, rounded up to the nearest second."
  ```
