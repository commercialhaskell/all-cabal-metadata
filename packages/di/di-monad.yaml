changelog: |+
  # Version 1.3.4

  * Fix typo in `unliftio-core` Cabal flag.


  # Version 1.3.3

  * Add `MonadBase`, `MonadBaseControl`, `PrimMonad` and `MonadSafe` instances
    for `DiT`.

  * Add Cabal flags for optional third-party libraries support: `monad-control`,
    `pipes`, `pipes-safe`, `primitive`, `streaming`, `transformers-base`,
    `unliftio-core`.


  # Version 1.3.2

  * Add `MonadUnliftIO` instance for `DiT`.

  * Add `MonadDi` instance for `streaming`'s `Stream`.


  # Version 1.3.1

  * Add `MonadError` instance for `DiT`.

  # Version 1.3

  * The `MonadThrow` instance for `DiT` doesn't log exceptions automatically any
    more. This is because otherwise catching and re-throwing exceptions in
    downstream code, by default, ends up logging the same exception more than
    once.

  * A `throw` function behaving as the previous `MonadThrow` instance for `DiT`
    was introduced.

  * Documentation improvements.


  # Version 1.2

  * The `MonadMask` constraint added in Version 1.1 is gone, effecively
    undoing the breaking change introduced in Version 1.1.


  # Version 1.1

  * **BREAKING CHANGE:** The `MonadThrow` instance for `DiT level path msg
    m` instance now relies on `Di.Core.throw`, potentially logging
    exceptions _at the throw site_.  This introduces a new `MonadMask m`
    instance constraint which can't be satisfied by `STM`. There is a
    `DiT level path msg STM` instance that skips logging exceptions (which
    is the only sensible behavior, anyway). However, if your `m` is not
    exactly `STM` but some wrapper around it, you will need to provide a
    `MonadThrow` instance manually or use `Di.Core.throw'` directly. On
    the other hand, satisfying this `MonadMask` constraint should be easy
    for monads that can run `IO`.

  * Added `onException`.

  # Version 1.0.2

  * Backwards compatibility with `mtl < 2.2.2`.

  # Version 1.0.1

  * Backwards compatibility with `transformers < 0.5.3`.

  # Version 1.0

  * This is a new library part of the `di-core` ecosystem.
    Consider this first release of the new ecosystem a preview release: The API is
    likely to stay stable, but extensive testing, formalization and tooling is
    due.
