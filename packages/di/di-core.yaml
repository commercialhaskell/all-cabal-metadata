  Typeful hierarchical structured logging without monad towers.


  If you like monad towers, though, check out

  [di-monad](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/di-monad).


  Also, for a logging library, this one doesn''t do any rendering of log messages.

  Please refer to [di-handle](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/di-handle)

  and [di-df1](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/di-df1) for that.
