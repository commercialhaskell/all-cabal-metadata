description: ! 'Diagrams is a full-featured framework and embedded domain-specific
  langauge for creating

  declarative vector graphics and animations.


  This package is just a convenient wrapper

  around the @diagrams-core@, @diagrams-lib@ and

  @diagrams-contrib@ packages, so they can be

  installed with a single @cabal install diagrams@

  command.


  The package also comes with flags to enable six

  different backends.

  A Haskell-native SVG

  backend (the @diagrams-svg@ package)

  can be selected with @-fsvg@. This

  flag is enabled by default, so if you do /not/

  want the SVG backend, you must explicitly

  disable it with @-f-svg@.  The SVG backend does not

  yet quite support all the features of the cairo

  backend: text alignment and embedded images are

  the two main missing features at this point, and

  of course it can only produce SVG images. It is,

  however, much easier to install, so it is the

  out-of-the-box default.


  There is also a cairo backend (the

  @diagrams-cairo@ package) which can be selected

  with the @-fcairo@ flag. It is fully-featured and

  can produce PNG, PS, PDF, SVG, or animated

  GIF output; however,

  due to its dependencies it can be difficult to

  install on some platforms (notably OS X).


  In addition, there is a GTK backend based on the

  cairo backend, for rendering diagrams directly to

  GTK windows. You can enable it with the @-fgtk@ flag.


  The Haskell-native postscript

  backend (the @diagrams-postscript@ package)

  can be selected with the @-fpostscript@ flag.  The only

  feature it does not support is transparency.


  There is a Rasterific backend which is

  also Haskell-native (the @diagrams-rasterific@

  package) which can be selected with the @-frasterific@

  flag. This is a fully featured backend with the ability

  to produce PNG, JPG, TIFF, BMP and animated GIF output.


  Finally there is a Canvas backend, also haskell native,

  which can be selected with the @-fcanvas@ flag. This

  backend allows users to write interactive images onto

  their web browsers.

  examples, tutorial, and user manual, see the
