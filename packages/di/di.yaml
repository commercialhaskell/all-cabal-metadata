synopsis: Typeful hierarchical structured logging using di, mtl and df1.
changelog: ! "# Version 1.0.1\n\n* COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE: We don't export
  `Di`, `DiT` nor `MonadDi`\n  anymore.\n\n* Re-export `Df1.Path`, `Df1.Level`, `Di.Df1.Df1`,
  `Di.Df1.Monad.Df1T`,\n  `Di.Df1.Monad.MonadDf1`.\n\n\n\n# Version 1.0\n\n* BREAKING
  CHANGE: Most of what used to be in this library lives now in\n  `di-core`. This
  library is now intended to be an entry point to the various\n  `di-*` libraries.
  Consider this first release of the new ecosystem a preview\n  release: The API is
  likely to stay stable, but extensive testing,\n  formalization and tooling is due.\n\n#
  Version 0.3\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: `mkDiTextStderr` and `mkDiStringHandle` return
  a `Di String\n  [String] String` now.\n\n* Made compatible with GHC 8.4.\n\n\n#
  Version 0.2\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: `Di` now takes a new type argument `level`.\n\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE: Remove `Level` and all related functions in favour of a\n  new
  `level` argument to `Di` to be implemented by the user.\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Require
  `Monoid` instance for the `path` type.\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Removed `level` function.
  Added `filter` function instead.\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Drop `mkDiTextStderr` and
  `mkDiTextFileHandle` in favour of\n  `mkDiStringHandle` and `mkDiStringStderr`.
  The rationale is that we are\n  already paying the costs of many `show` calls, and
  users of this library are\n  quite likely to use `String`s anyway (since they, too,
  are likely using `show`\n  results). We will bring back `Text` based `mkDiTextStderr`
  when we can make it\n  performant.\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Rename the `path` and `msg`
  functions to `contrapath` and\n  `contramsg`, flipping the order of their arguments
  so that the function comes\n  first (like in `contramap`).\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE:
  The `push` function now takes the `Di` value as second\n  argument.\n\n* Fix ISO8601
  formatting of second fractions.\n\n* Export `flush`.\n\n* Stricter ordering of async
  messages.\n\n* Added tests.\n\n* Added a lot of documentation.\n\n\n# Version 0.1\n\n*
  Initial version.\n\n"

  Typeful hierarchical structured logging using di, mtl and df1.


  This is meta-package bringing in together things from the `di-core`,

  `di-monad`, `di-handle` and `di-df1` libraries.


  See the `Di` module for more documentation.
