  # Version 1.3

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE: Renaming logging functions again.
    For example, `info` is the name we give to the `ToMessage`-polymorphic
    logging functions, `info_` to their `Message`-monomorphic version, and
    `info'` to the `STM` version. The previous `STM` suffix in `infoSTM`
    is gone, so as to mimick the naming conventions of `di-core`.

  * Re-export `attr_` from `Di.Df1.Monad`.

  * Re-export all of `MonadDi(..)` from `Di.Df1.Monad`.

  # Version 1.2.2

  * Re-export `ask` from `Di.Df1.Monad`.


  # Version 1.2.1

  * Improve logging of exceptions.

  * Documentation improvements.

  * Re-export `debug'`, `info'`, etc. from `Di.Df1.Monad`.


  # Version 1.2

  * The `MonadThrow` instance for `DiT` doesn't log exceptions automatically any
    more. This is because otherwise catching and re-throwing exceptions in
    downstream code, by default, ends up logging the same exception more than
    once.

  * A `throw` function behaving as the previous `MonadThrow` instance was
    introduced.


  # Version 1.1.1

  * Documentation improvements.

  * Re-export `Df1.ToSegment`, `Df1.segment`, `Df1.ToMessage`, `Df1.message`,
    `Df1.ToKey`, `Df1.key`, `Df1.ToValue`, `Df1.value`.

  # Version 1.1

  * **BREAKING CHANGE:** Exceptions are now logged _at the throw site_ by
    default now when possible, with level `Warning`. See the changelog for
    `di-monad-1.1`.


  # Version 1.0.1

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE: We don't export `Di`, `DiT` nor `MonadDi`
    anymore.

  * Re-export `Df1.Path`, `Df1.Level`, `Di.Df1.Df1`, `Di.Df1.Monad.Df1T`,
    `Di.Df1.Monad.MonadDf1`.



  # Version 1.0

  * BREAKING CHANGE: Most of what used to be in this library lives now in
    `di-core`. This library is now intended to be an entry point to the various
    `di-*` libraries. Consider this first release of the new ecosystem a preview
    release: The API is likely to stay stable, but extensive testing,
    formalization and tooling is due.

  # Version 0.3

  * BREAKING CHANGE: `mkDiTextStderr` and `mkDiStringHandle` return a `Di String
    [String] String` now.

  * Made compatible with GHC 8.4.


  # Version 0.2

  * BREAKING CHANGE: `Di` now takes a new type argument `level`.

  * BREAKING CHANGE: Remove `Level` and all related functions in favour of a
    new `level` argument to `Di` to be implemented by the user.

  * BREAKING CHANGE: Require `Monoid` instance for the `path` type.

  * BREAKING CHANGE: Removed `level` function. Added `filter` function instead.

  * BREAKING CHANGE: Drop `mkDiTextStderr` and `mkDiTextFileHandle` in favour of
    `mkDiStringHandle` and `mkDiStringStderr`. The rationale is that we are
    already paying the costs of many `show` calls, and users of this library are
    quite likely to use `String`s anyway (since they, too, are likely using `show`
    results). We will bring back `Text` based `mkDiTextStderr` when we can make it
    performant.

  * BREAKING CHANGE: Rename the `path` and `msg` functions to `contrapath` and
    `contramsg`, flipping the order of their arguments so that the function comes
    first (like in `contramap`).

  * BREAKING CHANGE: The `push` function now takes the `Di` value as second
    argument.

  * Fix ISO8601 formatting of second fractions.

  * Export `flush`.

  * Stricter ordering of async messages.

  * Added tests.

  * Added a lot of documentation.


  # Version 0.1

  * Initial version.

  # di

  Typeful hierarchical structured logging using di, mtl and df1.

  This is meta-package bringing in together things from the `di-core`,
  `di-monad`, `di-handle` and `di-df1` libraries.

  See the `Di` module for more documentation.
