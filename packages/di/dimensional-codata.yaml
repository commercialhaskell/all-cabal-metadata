description: ! "# dimensional-codata\r\nCODATA recommended values of fundamental physical
  constants, \r\nfor use with the [dimensional](https://github.com/bjornbm/dimensional)
  library.\r\n\r\nThis module offers a selection of fundamental physical constants
  with their values as defined or measured\r\nand published by the Committee on Data
  for Science and Technology of the International Council for Science.\r\n\r\nThese
  values are from the 2014 CODATA recommended values, by way of NIST.\r\n\r\nThe original
  document offers many, many more constants than are provided here. An effort has
  been made to narrow it\r\ndown to the most useful ones. If your work requires others
  or if you have another contribution or suggestion, please\r\nsubmit issues or pull
  requests to [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/dmcclean/dimensional-codata).\r\n"
