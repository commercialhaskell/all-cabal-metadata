    * Relax `base` version bounds to support 4.19.
      ([#157](https://github.com/haskell/directory/pull/157))
    * Support filepath >= 1.5.0.0 and os-string.
      ([#164](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/164))

  ## 1.3.8.1 (Feb 2023)

    * Use CApiFFI for utimensat.

  ## 1.3.5.0 (December 2019)

    * Revert change introduced in the version `1.3.3.2`: Non-absolute `XDG_*`
      environment variables are ignored.  This behavior is according to
      [*XDG Base Directory Specification* version 0.7](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/0.7/ar01s02.html)
      ([#100](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/100))

  ## 1.3.4.0 (July 2019)

    * `getXdgDirectory` and `getXdgDirectoryList` on Windows will now respect
      the XDG environment variables if present.
      ([#95](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/95))

  ## 1.3.3.2 (January 2019)

    * `getXdgDirectory` will no longer reject environment variables containing
      relative paths.
      ([#87](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/87))

    * `doesDirectoryExist` and `doesPathExist` reject empty paths once again,
      reversing an undocumented change introduced in 1.3.1.1.
      ([#84](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/84))

  ## 1.3.3.0 (June 2018)

    * Relax `unix` version bounds to support 2.8.

    * Relax `Win32` version bounds to support 2.8.

    * Use `SYMBOLIC_LINK_FLAG_ALLOW_UNPRIVILEGED_CREATE` when creating symbolic

  ## 1.3.2.0 (January 2018)

    * Relax `time` version bounds to support 1.9.

    * Implement `getXdgDirectoryList` and `XdgDirectoryList`.
      ([#78](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/78))

  ## 1.3.1.5 (October 2017)

    * Rename the internal header `windows.h` to avoid GHC#14312.
      ([#77](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/77))

  ## 1.3.1.4 (September 2017)

    * Fix `Win32` version 2.6 compatibility.
      ([#75](https://github.com/haskell/directory/pull/75))

  ## 1.3.1.3 (September 2017)

    * Relax `Win32` version bounds to support 2.6.

  ## 1.3.1.2 (September 2017)

    * Relax `base` version bounds to support 4.11.
      ([#74](https://github.com/haskell/directory/pull/74))

  ## 1.3.1.1 (March 2017)

    * Fix a bug where `createFileLink` and `createDirectoryLink` failed to
      handle `..` in absolute paths.

    * Improve support (partially) for paths longer than 260 characters on
      Windows.  To achieve this, many functions will now automatically prepend
      `\\?\` before calling the Windows API.  As a side effect, the `\\?\`
      prefix may show up in the error messages of the affected functions.

    * `makeAbsolute` can now handle drive-relative paths on Windows such as
      `C:foobar`

  ## 1.3.1.0 (March 2017)

    * `findFile` (and similar functions): when an absolute path is given, the
      list of search directories is now completely ignored.  Previously, if the
      list was empty, `findFile` would always fail.
      ([#72](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/72))

    * For symbolic links on Windows, the following functions had previously
      interpreted paths as referring to the links themselves rather than their
      targets.  This was inconsistent with other platforms and has been fixed.
        * `getFileSize`
        * `doesPathExist`
        * `doesDirectoryExist`
        * `doesFileExist`

    * Fix incorrect location info in errors from `pathIsSymbolicLink`.

    * Add functions for symbolic link manipulation:
        * `createFileLink`
        * `createDirectoryLink`
        * `removeDirectoryLink`
        * `getSymbolicLinkTarget`

    * `canonicalizePath` can now resolve broken symbolic links too.
      ([#64](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/64))

  ## 1.3.0.2 (February 2017)

    * [optimization] Increase internal buffer size of `copyFile`
      ([#69](https://github.com/haskell/directory/pull/69))

    * Relax `time` version bounds to support 1.8.

  ## 1.3.0.1 (January 2017)

    * Relax `Win32` version bounds to support 2.5.
      ([#67](https://github.com/haskell/directory/pull/67))

  ## 1.3.0.0 (December 2016)

    * **[breaking]** Drop trailing slashes in `canonicalizePath`
      ([#63](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/63))

    * **[deprecation]** Rename `isSymbolicLink` to `pathIsSymbolicLink`.  The
      old name will remain available but may be removed in the next major
      release.
      ([#52](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/52))

    * Changed `canonicalizePath` to dereference symbolic links even if it points
      to a file and is not the last path segment

    * On Windows, `canonicalizePath` now canonicalizes the letter case too

    * On Windows, `canonicalizePath` now also dereferences symbolic links

    * When exceptions are thrown, the error location will now contain additional
      information about the internal function(s) used.

  ## 1.2.7.1 (November 2016)

    * Don't abort `removePathForcibly` if files or directories go missing.
      In addition, keep going even if an exception occurs.
      ([#60](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/60))

  ## 1.2.7.0 (August 2016)

    * Remove deprecated C bits.  This means `HsDirectory.h` and its functions
      are no longer available.
      ([#50](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/50))

    * Add `doesPathExist` and `getFileSize`
      ([#57](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/57))

    * Add `renamePath`
      ([#58](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/58))

    * Add `removePathForcibly`
      ([#59](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/59))

  ## 1.2.6.3 (May 2016)

    * Add missing import of `(<*>)` on Windows for `base` earlier than 4.8.0.0
      ([#53](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/53))

  ## 1.2.6.2 (April 2016)

    * Bundled with GHC 8.0.1

    * Fix typo in file time functions when `utimensat` is not available and
      version of `unix` package is lower than 2.7.0.0

  ## 1.2.6.1 (April 2016)

    * Fix mistake in file time functions when `utimensat` is not available
      ([#47](https://github.com/haskell/directory/pull/47))

  ## 1.2.6.0 (April 2016)

    * Make `findExecutable`, `findExecutables`, `findExecutablesInDirectories`,
      `findFile`, and `findFilesWith` lazier
      ([#43](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/43))

    * Add `findFileWith`

    * Add `copyFileWithMetadata`, which copies additional metadata
      ([#40](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/40))

    * Improve error message of `removeDirectoryRecursive` when used on a
      directory symbolic link on Windows.

    * Add `isSymbolicLink`

    * Drop support for Hugs.

  ## 1.2.5.1 (February 2016)

    * Improve error message of `getCurrentDirectory` when the current working
      directory no longer exists
      ([#39](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/39))

    * Fix the behavior of trailing path separators in `canonicalizePath` as well
      as `makeAbsolute` when applied to the current directory; they should now
      match the behavior of `canonicalizePath` prior to 1.2.3.0 (when the bug
      was introduced)
      ([#42](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/42))

    * Set the location in IO errors from `makeAbsolute`.

  ## 1.2.5.0 (December 2015)

    * Add `listDirectory`, which is similar to `getDirectoryContents`
      but omits `.` and `..`
      ([#36](https://github.com/haskell/directory/pull/36))

    * Remove support for `--with-cc=` in `configure`; use the `CC=` flag instead
      ([ghc:D1608](https://phabricator.haskell.org/D1608))

  ## 1.2.4.0 (September 2015)

    * Work around lack of `#const_str` when cross-compiling
      ([haskell-cafe](F7D))

    * Add `findExecutablesInDirectories`
      ([#33](https://github.com/haskell/directory/pull/33))

    * Add `exeExtension`

  [F7D]: https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2015-August/120892.html

  ## 1.2.3.1 (August 2015)

    * Restore support for Safe Haskell with base < 4.8
      ([#30](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/30))

  ## 1.2.3.0 (July 2015)

    * Add support for XDG Base Directory Specification
      ([#6](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/6))

    * Implement `setModificationTime` counterpart to `getModificationTime`
      ([#13](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/13))

    * Implement `getAccessTime` and `setAccessTime`

    * Set the filename in IO errors from the file time functions

    * Fix `canonicalizePath` so that it always returns a reasonable result even
      if the path is inaccessible and will not throw exceptions unless the
      current directory cannot be obtained
      ([#23](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/23))

    * Corrected the trailing slash behavior of `makeAbsolute`
      so that `makeAbsolute "" == makeAbsolute "."`

    * Deprecate use of `HsDirectory.h` and `HsDirectoryConfig.h`

    * Implement `withCurrentDirectory`

  ## 1.2.2.1 (Apr 2015)

    * Make `getModificationTime` support sub-second resolution on Windows

    * Fix silent failure in `createDirectoryIfMissing`

    * Replace `throw` by better defined `throwIO`s

    * Avoid stack overflow in `getDirectoryContents`
      ([#17](https://github.com/haskell/directory/pull/17))

    * Expose `findExecutables`
      ([#14](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/14))

    * `removeDirectoryRecursive` no longer follows symlinks under any
      circumstances
      ([#15](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/15))

    * Allow trailing path separators in `getPermissions` on Windows
      ([#9](https://github.com/haskell/directory/issues/9))

    * `renameFile` now always throws the correct error type
      (`InappropriateType`) when the destination is a directory, as long as the
      filesystem is not being modified concurrently
      ([#8](https://github.com/haskell/directory/pull/8))

    * Add `makeAbsolute`, which should be preferred over `canonicalizePath`
      unless one requires symbolic links to be resolved

  ## 1.2.1.0 (Mar 2014)

  Building from Git repository
  ----------------------------

  When building this package directly from the Git repository, one must run
  `autoreconf -fi` to generate the `configure` script needed by `cabal
  configure`.  This requires [Autoconf][ac] to be installed.

      autoreconf -fi
      cabal install

  There is no need to run the `configure` script manually however, as `cabal
  configure` does that automatically.
