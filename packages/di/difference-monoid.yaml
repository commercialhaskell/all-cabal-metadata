description: ! "# difference-monoid\n\nThis package provides the Difference Monoid,
  which adds subtraction to\narbitrary monoids.\n\nThis has a number of uses:\n\n*
  `Diff (Product a)` will give you a type similar to\nData.Ratio. Here, the \"subtraction\"
  operation is division. For\nexample:\n\n    ```haskell\n    >>> (1 :-: 2) <> (3
  :-: 4) :: Diff (Product Int)\n    Product {getProduct = 3} :-: Product {getProduct
  = 8}\n    ```\n\n* In a similar vein, `Diff (Sum a)` will add subtraction\nto a
  numeric type:\n\n    ```haskell\n    >>> runDiff (-) (diff 2 <> diff 3 <> invert
  (diff 4)) :: Sum Natural\n    Sum {getSum = 1}\n    ```\n\n    This will let you
  work with nonnegative types, where you need some\n    form of subtraction (for,
  e.g., differences, hence the name), and\n    you only want to check for underflow
  once.\n\n* Using the above example, in particular, we get a monoid for averages:\n\n
  \   ```haskell\n    >>> import Data.Function (on)\n    >>> let avg = runDiff ((%)
  `on` getProduct.getSum) . foldMap (fmap Sum . diff . Product)\n    >>> avg [1,4,3,2,5]\n
  \   3 % 1\n    ```\n\nThe Monoid and Semigroup laws hold in a pretty\nstraightforward
  way, provided the underlying type also follows those\nlaws.\n\nFor the Group laws,
  the underlying type must be a\ncancellative semigroup.\n\nA cancellative semigroup
  is one where\n\n* `a <> b = a <> c` implies `b = c`\n* `b <> a = c <> a` implies
  `b = c`\n\nIf this does not hold, than the equivalence only holds modulo the\nthe
  addition of some constant\n\nMost common semigroups are cancellative, however notable\nexceptions
  include the cross product of vectors, matrix\nmultiplication, and sets:\n\n```haskell\nfromList
  [1] <> fromList [1,2] = fromList [1] <> fromList [2]`\n```\n\nThis type is known
  formally as the [Grothendieck group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grothendieck_group).\n\nThe
  package also provides the `Parity` monad and comonad, which is left-adjunct to the
  difference monoid.\n"
