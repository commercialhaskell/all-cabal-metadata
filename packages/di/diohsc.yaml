  # Changelog for diohsc
  This file covers only non-trivial user-visible changes;
  see the git log for full gory details.

  ## 0.1.6
  * New command "query" for e.g. convenient use of search engines
  * Allow IRIs in user input (converted to URIs)
  * Implement SOCKS5 support (-S and -P options)
  * Fix bug triggered by /home being a symlink
  * Fix bug with connecting to literal IPv6 addresses

  ## 0.1.5
  * Align and wrap link lines; add option to print description first
  * Use reverse video in prompt for added visibility (thanks Ben)
  * Try all addresses when making connections (thanks rwv)
  * Improve behaviour in non-interactive mode; add --batch to enable it
  * Fix X.509 version and use dummy notAfter in generated client certificates
  * Fix bugs in wrapping and relative link display

  ## 0.1.4
  * Indicate links to cached history items
  * Retry with full handshake if session resume fails
  * Recommend trust for new certificate signed by previous certificate
  * Increase client cert validity to 50y
  * Make ghost mode even more spectral

  ## 0.1.3
  * Allow trusting certificates just for the current session
  * Don't require tail certificates to be v3
  * Add uri of any request to log, even if request fails
  * Just show fingerprint of known cert rather than picture

  ## 0.1.2
  * Add @ target modifier for history root
  * Understand e.g. ~<
  * Suppress alt text by default
  * Fix: uri quoting for queries and file:// was incorrect
  * Fix: queue was not appended to on exit in non-interactive mode

description: "# Diohsc: Denotationally Intricate Obedient Haskell Smallnet Client\ndiohsc
  [URI]\n\n## Features\n* Simple line-based command-response terminal user interface
  with ANSI colour.\n* Terse but combinatorially expressive command language.\n* Navigational
  aids: history, marks, queue.\n* Facilities to invoke external commands and use per-scheme
  proxies.\n* Responses streamed to pager or external command.\n* Certificate checking
  with TOFU and/or explicitly trusted CAs.\n* Support for TLS resuming, 0RTT, and
  client certificates.\n* All configuration and certificates stored as user-manipulable
  files.\n* Extensive help.\n\n## Building\nInstall the haskell package manager cabal;
  e.g. on a debian system:\n```\n$ sudo apt-get install cabal-install\n```\nThen in
  the diohsc directory, run\n```\n$ cabal update && cabal install\n```\nThe resulting
  binary will be installed as `~/.cabal/bin/diohsc`.\n\n### Compile-time options\nlibmagic
  can be used to detect mimetypes of local files; try: `cabal install -f Magic`\n\n##
  Trusting server certificates\nFirst, a disclaimer: do not trust this software to
  keep you secure. Although everything seems to be working as intended, and though
  the libraries it depends on seem solid, this is \"very alpha\" software and should
  not be relied on.\n\ndiohsc uses \"Trust On First Use\": if a host provides a certificate
  chain you do not currently trust, the client will ask for confirmation then add
  the certificate for the host to a collection stored in `~/.diohsc/known_hosts/`
  if there isn't already one stored; if there is one already stored, it will give
  some details and ask if you want to overwrite it with the newly provided one.\n\nYou
  can also trust Certificate Authorities by putting their certificates in `~/.diohsc/trusted_certs/`.
  For example, if you want to trust all the certificates installed on your system,\n```\n$
  ln -s /etc/ssl/certs/* ~/.diohsc/trusted_certs/\n```\nor if you just want to trust
  Let's Encrypt:\n```\n$ mkdir ~/.diohsc/trusted_certs\n$ wget -O ~/.diohsc/trusted_certs/lets-encrypt-x3-cross-signed.pem
  https://letsencrypt.org/certs/lets-encrypt-x3-cross-signed.pem\n$ sha256sum ~/.diohsc/trusted_certs/lets-encrypt-x3-cross-signed.pem\ne446c5e9dbef9d09ac9f7027c034602492437a05ff6c40011d7235fca639c79a
  /home/me/.diohsc/trusted_certs/lets-encrypt-x3-cross-signed.pem\n```\n\n## Configuration\nSee
  diohscrc.sample for ideas for configuration options, in particular indicating how
  to make use of third-party software to allow diohsc to access gopher, and parse
  markdown and html, and provide ascii-art previews of image files. Copy the file
  to ~/.diohsc/diohscrc and uncomment lines as appropriate.\n\n## Multiple instances\nMultiple
  simultaneous diohsc instances may share ~/.diohsc without serious conflict. However,
  command history is written only on exit, so the last instance to exit will determine
  that history. The log is appended to continuously, but read only on startup, so
  logs from simultaneous instances will be interleaved. Uris in ~/.diohsc/queue are
  taken by an instance on startup and whenever it processes a command, and leftover
  queue items are written there on exit.\n\nTo ensure that an instance won't interfere
  with other running instances: either use \"--datadir\" to specify an alternative
  directory to ~/.diohsc, or use the \"--ghost\" option (which also acts as a \"private
  browsing\" mode).\n\n## Running under Windows\nIt is apparently possible to compile
  and run diohsc on Windows. However, it requires a terminal with ANSI and unicode
  support, which it seems is not the default situation in even the most recent versions
  of Windows. On Windows 10, following the instructions of this link has been reported
  to work: \n[https://akr.am/blog/posts/using-utf-8-in-the-windows-terminal](https://akr.am/blog/posts/using-utf-8-in-the-windows-terminal)\n"
