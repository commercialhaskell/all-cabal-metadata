description: |-
  An n-D distance transform that computes the Euclidean
  distance between each element in a discrete field and the nearest cell
  containing a zero.

  The algorithm implemented is based off of
  Meijster et al., /"A general algorithm for computing distance/
  /transforms in linear time."/ Parallel versions of both the Euclidean
  distance transform and squared Euclidean distance transform are also
  provided.
