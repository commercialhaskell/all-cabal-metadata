  ### distributed-process-monad-control

  Orphan instances for `MonadBase` and `MonadBaseControl`. Please see the [tutorial](http://haskell-distributed.github.io/tutorials/3ch.html#monad-transformer-stacks) for an introduction and use case for these instances. Also please note that these instances enable the use of functions that are un-sound in the context of `distributed-process`. Functions such as `forkIO` (or, `fork` from `lifted-base`) compromise invariants in the Process monad and can lead to confusing and subtle issues. Always use the Cloud Haskell functions such as `spawnLocal` instead.

  This repository is part of Cloud Haskell.

  See http://haskell-distributed.github.io for documentation, user guides,
  tutorials and assistance.
