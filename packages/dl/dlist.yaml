  [![hackage-badge][]][hackage-dlist]
  [![packdeps-badge][]][packdeps]

  _**List-like types supporting O(1) `append` and `snoc` operations.**_

  ## Installation

  [`dlist`][hackage-dlist] is a Haskell package available from [Hackage][hackage].
  It can be installed with [`cabal`][cabal] or [`stack`][stack].

  See the [change log][changelog] for the changes in each version.

  ## Usage

  Here is an example of “flattening” a `Tree` into a list of the elements in its
  `Leaf` constructors:

  ```haskell
  import qualified Data.DList as DList

  data Tree a = Leaf a | Branch (Tree a) (Tree a)

  flattenSlow :: Tree a -> [a]
  flattenSlow = go
    where
      go (Leaf x) = [x]
      go (Branch left right) = go left ++ go right

  flattenFast :: Tree a -> [a]
  flattenFast = DList.toList . go
    where
      go (Leaf x) = DList.singleton x
      go (Branch left right) = go left `DList.append` go right
  ```

  (The above code can be found in the [benchmark][].)

  `flattenSlow` is likely to be slower than `flattenFast`:

  1. `flattenSlow` uses `++` to concatenate lists, each of which is recursively
     constructed from the `left` and `right` `Tree` values in the `Branch`
     constructor.

  2. `flattenFast` does not use `++` but constructs a composition of functions,
     each of which is a “cons” introduced by `DList.singleton` (`(x :)`). The
     function `DList.toList` applies the composed function to `[]`, constructing
     a list in the end.

  To see the difference between `flattenSlow` and `flattenFast`, consider some
  rough evaluations of the functions applied to a `Tree`:

  ```haskell
  flattenSlow (Branch (Branch (Leaf 'a') (Leaf 'b')) (Leaf 'c'))
    = go (Branch (Branch (Leaf 'a') (Leaf 'b')) (Leaf 'c'))
    = go (Branch (Leaf 'a') (Leaf 'b')) ++ go (Leaf 'c')
    = (go (Leaf 'a') ++ go (Leaf 'b')) ++ "c"
    = ("a" ++ "b") ++ "c"
    = ('a' : [] ++ "b") ++ "c"
    = ('a' : "b") ++ "c"
    = 'a' : "b" ++ "c"
    = 'a' : 'b' : [] ++ "c"
    = 'a' : 'b' : "c"
  ```

  ```haskell
  flattenFast (Branch (Branch (Leaf 'a') (Leaf 'b')) (Leaf 'c'))
    = toList $ go (Branch (Branch (Leaf 'a') (Leaf 'b')) (Leaf 'c'))
    = toList $ go (Branch (Leaf 'a') (Leaf 'b')) `append` go (Leaf 'c')
    = unsafeApplyDList (go (Branch (Leaf 'a') (Leaf 'b'))) . unsafeApplyDList (go (Leaf 'c')) $ []
    = unsafeApplyDList (go (Branch (Leaf 'a') (Leaf 'b'))) (unsafeApplyDList (go (Leaf 'c')) [])
    = unsafeApplyDList (go (Branch (Leaf 'a') (Leaf 'b'))) (unsafeApplyDList (singleton 'c') [])
    = unsafeApplyDList (go (Branch (Leaf 'a') (Leaf 'b'))) (unsafeApplyDList (UnsafeDList ((:) 'c')) [])
    = unsafeApplyDList (go (Branch (Leaf 'a') (Leaf 'b'))) "c"
    = unsafeApplyDList (UnsafeDList (unsafeApplyDList (go (Leaf 'a')) . unsafeApplyDList (go (Leaf 'b')))) "c"
    = unsafeApplyDList (go (Leaf 'a')) (unsafeApplyDList (go (Leaf 'b')) "c")
    = unsafeApplyDList (go (Leaf 'a')) (unsafeApplyDList (singleton 'b') "c")
    = unsafeApplyDList (go (Leaf 'a')) (unsafeApplyDList (UnsafeDList ((:) 'b')) "c")
    = unsafeApplyDList (go (Leaf 'a')) ('b' : "c")
    = unsafeApplyDList (singleton 'a') ('b' : "c")
    = unsafeApplyDList (UnsafeDList ((:) 'a')) ('b' : "c")
    = 'a' : 'b' : "c"
  ```

  The left-nested `++` in `flattenSlow` results in intermediate list constructions
  that are immediately discarded in the evaluation of the outermost `++`. On the
  other hand, the evaluation of `flattenFast` involves no intermediate list
  construction but rather function applications and `newtype` constructor wrapping
  and unwrapping. This is where the efficiency comes from.

  _**Warning!**_ Note that there is truth in the above, but there is also a lot of
  hand-waving and intrinsic complexity. For example, there may be GHC rewrite
  rules that apply to `++`, which will change the actual evaluation. And, of
  course, strictness, laziness, and sharing all play a significant role. Also, not
  every function in the `dlist` package is the most efficient for every situation.

  _**Moral of the story:**_ If you are using `dlist` to speed up your code, check
  to be sure that it actually does. Benchmark!

  ## Design Notes

  These are some notes on design and development choices made for the `dlist`
  package.

  ### Avoid `++`

  The original intent of Hughes' representation of lists as first-class functions
  was to provide an abstraction such that the list `append` operation found in
  functional programming languages (and now called `++` in Haskell) would not
  appear in left-nested positions to avoid duplicated structure as lists are
  constructed. The lesson learned by many people using list over the years is that
  the `append` operation can appear, sometimes surprisingly, in places they don't
  expect it.

  One of our goals is for the `dlist` package to avoid surprising its users with
  unexpected insertions of `++`. Towards this end, there should be a minimal set
  of functions in `dlist` in which `++` can be directly or indirectly found. The
  list of known uses of `++` includes:

  * `DList`: `fromList`, `fromString`, `read`
  * `DNonEmpty`: `fromList`, `fromNonEmpty`, `fromString`, `read`

  If any future requested functions involve `++` (e.g. via `fromList`), the burden
  of inclusion is higher than it would be otherwise.

  ### Abstraction

  The `DList` representation and its supporting functions (e.g. `append`, `snoc`,
  etc.) rely on an invariant to preserve its safe use. That is, without this
  invariant, a user may encounter unexpected outcomes.

  (We use safety in the sense that the semantics are well-defined and expected,
  not in the sense of side of referential transparency. The invariant does not
  directly lead to side effects in the `dlist` package, but a program that uses an
  unsafely generated `DList` may do something surprising.)

  The invariant is that, for any `xs :: DList a`:

  ```haskell
  fromList (toList xs) = xs
  ```

  To see how this invariant can be broken, consider this example:

  ```haskell
  xs :: DList a
  xs = UnsafeDList (const [])

  fromList (toList (xs `snoc` 1))
    = fromList (toList (UnsafeDList (const []) `snoc` 1))
    = fromList (toList (UnsafeDList (unsafeApplyDList (UnsafeDList (const [])) . (x :))))
    = fromList (toList (UnsafeDList (const [] . (x :))))
    = fromList (($ []) . unsafeApplyDList $ UnsafeDList (const [] . (x :)))
    = fromList (const [] . (x :) $ [])
    = fromList (const [] [x])
    = fromList []
    = UnsafeDList (++ [])
  ```

  The invariant can also be stated as:

  ```haskell
  toList (fromList (toList xs)) = toList xs
  ```

  And we can restate the example as:

  ```haskell
  toList (fromList (toList (xs `snoc` 1)))
    = toList (UnsafeDList (++ []))
    = []
  ```

  It would be rather unhelpful and surprising to find ``(xs `snoc` 1)`` turned out
  to be the empty list.

  To preserve the invariant on `DList`, we provide it as an abstract type in the
  `Data.DList` module. The constructor, `UnsafeDList`, and record label,
  `unsafeApplyDList`, are not exported because these can be used, as shown above,
  to break the invariant.

  All of that said, there have been numerous requests to export the `DList`
  constructor. We are not convinced that it is necessary, but we are convinced
  that users should decide for themselves.

  To use the constructor and record label of `DList`, you import them as follows:

  ```haskell
  import Data.DList.Unsafe (DList(UnsafeDList, unsafeApplyDList))
  ```

  If you are using Safe Haskell, you may need to add this at the top of your
  module:

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE Trustworthy #-}
  ```

  Just be aware that the burden of proof for safety is on you.
