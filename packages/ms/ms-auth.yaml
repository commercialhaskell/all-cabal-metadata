description: "# ms-auth\n\nHaskell client bindings to the [Microsoft Identity / Active
  Directory API]().\n    \n[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/ms-auth?style=for-the-badge)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ms-auth)\n\n![main](https://github.com/unfoldml/ms-graph-api/actions/workflows/haskell.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)\n\n\n##
  Introduction\n\nThis library provides helpers for building token-based authentication
  flows within server-based web apps e.g. \n\n* [Client Credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow)
  (server/server or automation accounts)\n* [Authorization Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow)
  (with human users being prompted to delegate some access rights to the app)\n\n,
  as well as for keeping tokens up to date in the background.\n\n\n## Status\n\nThis
  library is functional but still in development.\n\n## Evolution of the library\n\nSome
  breaking changes might also be introduced as the library matures.\n\nWe adhere to
  a simplified version of the [Package Versioning Policy](https://pvp.haskell.org/):
  breaking changes are signaled by increasing the major version number (e.g. 0.x ->
  1.x ).\n\n\n## Copyright\n\n(c) 2023-, Marco Zocca, UnfoldML AB\n"
