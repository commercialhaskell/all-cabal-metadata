  ## Unreleased


  ## 0.4.0.0

  Add Bot Framework support

  Breaking changes:
  - MSAuth is the only public interface module
  - 'newNoToken' and 'fetchUpdateToken' are not expored anymore from Session and MSAuth, in favor of a single function 'tokenUpdateLoop' which does both the initialization and the refresh loop
  - 'applyDotEnv' and the 'DotEnv' module are gone. Please use the equivalent package 'dotenv-micro'

  ## 0.3.0.0

  defaultAzureCredential - simplified version of the Microsoft Identity SDK

  introduced MSAuth module that re-exports internal functions

  Breaking changes:
  - module Network.OAuth2.JWT is not exposed anymore
  - OAuthCfg does not contain fields for client ID and secret anymore
  - client ID and client secret can only be loaded from environment variables
  - Network.OAuth2.Provider.AzureAD azureADApp and azureOAuthADApp return in MonadIO since they look up client ID and secret from the environment

description: "# ms-auth\n\nHaskell client bindings to the [Microsoft Identity / Active
  Directory API]().\n    \n[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/ms-auth?style=for-the-badge)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ms-auth)\n\n![main](https://github.com/unfoldml/ms-graph-api/actions/workflows/haskell.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)\n\n\n##
  Introduction\n\nThis library provides helpers for building token-based authentication
  flows within server-based web apps e.g. \n\n* [Client Credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow)
  (server/server or automation accounts)\n* [Authorization Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow)
  (with human users being prompted to delegate some access rights to the app)\n\n,
  as well as for keeping tokens up to date in the background.\n\n\n## Status\n\nThis
  library is functional but still in development.\n\n## Evolution of the library\n\nSome
  breaking changes might also be introduced as the library matures.\n\nWe adhere to
  the [Package Versioning Policy](https://pvp.haskell.org/): major breaking changes
  or API refactors are signaled by increasing the first major version number (i.e.
  0.0.0.0 -> 1.0.0.0 ) whereas less significant ones are indicated by increasing the
  second one (0.0.0.0 -> 0.1.0.0).\n\nSignificant changes in the SDK will be documented
  in the respective CHANGELOG.\n\n\n## Copyright\n\n(c) 2023-, Marco Zocca, UnfoldML
