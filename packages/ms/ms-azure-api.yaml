description: "# ms-azure-api\n\nHaskell client bindings to the [Microsoft Azure API]().\n
  \   \n[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/ms-azure-api?style=for-the-badge)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ms-azure-api)\n\n![main](https://github.com/unfoldml/ms-graph-api/actions/workflows/haskell.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)\n\n\n##
  Introduction\n\nThis library provides the client interface (under the `MSAzureAPI`
  namespace).\n\nAuthentication can be implemented with the `ms-auth` library.\n\n##
  Status\n\nThis library is still in development, so expect missing functionality.\nIf
  there's anything you would like to see added, feel free to\n[open an issue](https://github.com/unfoldml/ms-graph-api/issues/new).\nIn
  general, since the MS Azure API is quite large, features will be added to this library
  on a need basis.\n\n## Evolution of the library\n\nSome breaking changes might also
  be introduced as the library matures.\n\nWe adhere to a simplified version of the
  [Package Versioning Policy](https://pvp.haskell.org/): breaking changes are signaled
  by increasing the major version number (e.g. 0.x -> 1.x ).\n\n\n## Copyright\n\n(c)
