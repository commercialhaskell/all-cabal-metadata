description: "# ms-graph-api\n\nHaskell client bindings to the [Microsoft Graph API
  v1.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/overview?view=graph-rest-1.0).\n
  \   \n[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/ms-graph-api?style=for-the-badge)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ms-graph-api)\n\n![main](https://github.com/unfoldml/ms-graph-api/actions/workflows/haskell.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)\n\n\n##
  Introduction\n\nThis library provides both the client interface (under the `MSGraphAPI`
  namespace) as well as helpers to integrate with Microsoft infrastructure, e.g. using
  ActiveDirectory as an OAuth2 identity provider.\n\nWith the provided auth functions
  (see `Network.OAuth2.Session`) you can easily implement OAuth2 for your application,
  and the resulting token store is thread-safe and automatically renews before expiring.\n\n##
  Status\n\nThis library is still in development, so expect missing functionality.\nIf
  there's anything you would like to see added, feel free to\n[open an issue](https://github.com/unfoldml/ms-graph-api/issues/new).\nIn
  general, since the MS Graph API is quite large, features will be added to this library
  on a need basis.\n\n## Evolution of the library\n\nSome breaking changes might also
  be introduced as the library matures.\n\nWe adhere to a simplified version of the
  [Package Versioning Policy](https://pvp.haskell.org/): breaking changes are signaled
  by increasing the major version number (e.g. 0.x -> 1.x ).\n\n\n## Copyright\n\n(c)
