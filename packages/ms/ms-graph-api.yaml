description: "# ms-graph-api\n\nHaskell client bindings to the [Microsoft Graph API
  v1.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/overview?view=graph-rest-1.0).\n
  \   \n[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/ms-graph-api?style=for-the-badge)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ms-graph-api)\n\n![main](https://github.com/unfoldml/ms-graph-api/actions/workflows/haskell.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)\n\n\n##
  Introduction\n\nThis library provides both client interface to the MS Grapi API
  (under the `MSGraphAPI` namespace).\n\nAuthentication can be implemented with the
  `ms-auth` library.\n\n## Status\n\nThis library is still in development, so expect
  missing functionality.\nIf there's anything you would like to see added, feel free
  to\n[open an issue](https://github.com/unfoldml/ms-graph-api/issues/new).\nIn general,
  since the MS Graph API is quite large, features will be added to this library on
  a need basis.\n\n## Evolution of the library\n\nSome breaking changes might also
  be introduced as the library matures.\n\nWe adhere to the [Package Versioning Policy](https://pvp.haskell.org/):
  major breaking changes or API refactors are signaled by increasing the first major
  version number (i.e. 0.0.0.0 -> 1.0.0.0 ) whereas less significant ones are indicated
  by increasing the second one (0.0.0.0 -> 0.1.0.0)\n\nSignificant changes in the
  SDK will be documented in the respective CHANGELOG.\n\n## Copyright\n\n(c) 2023-,
