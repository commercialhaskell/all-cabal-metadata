  v1.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/overview?view=graph-rest-1.0).\n

  Description\n\nThis library provides both the client interface and authorization
  infrastructure to integrate with Microsoft infrastructure, e.g. using ActiveDirectory
  as an OAuth2 identity provider.\n\n## Status\n\nThis library is still in development,
  so expect missing funcionality.\nIf there's anything you would like to see added,
  feel free to\n[open an issue](https://github.com/unfoldml/ms-graph-api/issues/new).\nSome
  breaking changes might also be introduced as the library matures.\n\n## Copyright\n\n(c)
