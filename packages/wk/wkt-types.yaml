description: "# wkt-types\n\nThis library implements parsers for `.wkt` files, based
  on the specification at https://www.ogc.org/standard/sfa/. For lack of clarity,
  some geometries (triangles/TIN/polyhedralSurfaces) aren't completely implemented
  yet. \n\n## How to use\n\n`Data.WTK.IO` exports two key methods, `readWKTFile` and
  `writeWKTFile`. When read, a `.wkt` file will be interpreted into a `Geometries`
  object. You can manipulate it at will, and then use `writeWKTFile` to write the
  `.wkt` file for the new `Geometries`. \nIndividual types such as `Point`, `LineString`,
  `Polygon`, etc. also have their own individual parsers, serializers (`fromWKT`)
  and deserializers (`toWKT`).\n\nGeometries are always read with `Double` as its
  base type for simplicity, but can be changed through `fmap`ing. "
