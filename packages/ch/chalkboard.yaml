description: |-
  ChalkBoard is a Haskell hosted Domain Specific Language (DSL) for image generation and processing.
  The basic structure is a Chalk Board, a two-dimensional canvas of values, typically colors.
  ChalkBoard provides the usual image processing functions (masking, overlaying, function mapping,
  cropping, warping, rotating) as well as a few more unusual ones.
  Images can be imported into ChalkBoard, as first-class color chalk boards.
  ChalkBoard also provides combinators for drawing shapes on directly on boards.
  The system is based loosely on Pan, but the principal image type, a Board, is abstract.
