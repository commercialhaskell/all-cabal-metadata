description: |-
  Chalkboard is a Haskell hosted Domain Specific Language (DSL) for image generation and processing.
  The basic structure is a chalk board, a two-dimensional canvas of values, typically colors.
  Chalkboard provides the usual image processing functions (masking, overlaying, function mapping,
  cropping, warping, rotating) as well as a few more unusual ones.

  Chalkboard Viewer is a portal into a dynamically updatable Board, via an OpenGL window.
