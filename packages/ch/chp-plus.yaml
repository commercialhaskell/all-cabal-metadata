description: |-
  In version 1.0.0, this package contains functionality split
  off during the chp 1.x to 2.0 transition.  In future, it will
  contain any new CHP features that build on the core library,
  and that do not require access to CHP's internals.  This
  package is closely tied to the chp package.
