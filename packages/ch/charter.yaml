  # Changelog for charter

  ## Unreleased changes
changelog-type: markdown
description: "# Charter\n\n`charter` is a typed Haskell layer on top of [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart)
  \nwhich allows quickly and easily visualizing your Haskell data in the browser!\n\nIt
  also provides **live-updates** as your data changes in Haskell-land.\n\nWhy Google
  Charts?\n\nGoogle Charts provides a large amount of flexible data representations
  which \nuse a relatively consistent data format, making it easy to switch between
  chart types.\n\n## Goals\n\nGoals of this library include:\n\n* Quick to start\n*
  Batteries Included\n* Well-typed, but not at the expense of usability\n* Smooth
  learning curve as you add more complex options to your charts\n* Live chart updates!\n\nNon-Goals
  of this library include:\n\n* Writing charts to disk: sorry, try taking a screenshot
  of your browser instead!\n* Performance: All your data turns into JSON and gets
  piped through the browser, it'll be slower than other solutions on large datasets.\n*
  Composability with other solutions: This library is \"battery included\" and doesn't
  provide many extension points.\n\n## Roadmap\n\n* Better Date, Time, and DateTime
  support\n* Support for Geocharts, TreeMaps, Tables, Timeline, Gauges\n* Support
  multiple charts on a screen\n* Support combo charts\n"
