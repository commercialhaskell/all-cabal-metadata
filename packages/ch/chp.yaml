description: |-
  The Communicating Haskell Processes (CHP) library is an
  implementation of message-passing concurrency ideas from
  Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes.  More details and
  a tutorial can be found at its homepage:
  <http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/ofa/chp/>, and there is
  also now a blog with examples of using the library:
  <http://chplib.wordpress.com/>.  The library requires at
  least GHC 6.8.1.  NOTE: since version 2.0.0, some capabilities
  that were present in version 1.x have been moved out to the
  chp-plus package.
