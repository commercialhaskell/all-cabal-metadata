description: |-
  Chronos is a performance-oriented time library for Haskell, with a
  straightforward API. The main differences between this
  and the <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/time time> library
  are:
  * Chronos uses machine integers where possible. This means
  that time-related arithmetic should be faster, with the
  drawback that the types are incapable of representing times
  that are very far in the future or the past (because Chronos
  provides nanosecond, rather than picosecond, resolution).
  For most users, this is not a hindrance.
  * Chronos provides 'ToJSON'/'FromJSON' instances for serialisation.
  * Chronos provides 'Unbox' instances for working with unboxed vectors.
  * Chronos provides 'Prim' instances for working with byte arrays/primitive arrays.
  * Chronos uses normal non-overloaded haskell functions for
  encoding and decoding time. It provides <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/attoparsec attoparsec> parsers for both 'Text' and
  'ByteString'. Additionally, Chronos provides functions for
  encoding time to 'Text' or 'ByteString'. The http://hackage.haskell.org/package/time time> library accomplishes these with the
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/time-1.9.3/docs/Data-Time-Format.html Data.Time.Format> module, which uses UNIX-style datetime
  format strings. The approach taken by Chronos is faster and
  catches more mistakes at compile time, at the cost of being
  less expressive.
