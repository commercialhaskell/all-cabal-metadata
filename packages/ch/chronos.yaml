description: ! 'Performance-oriented time library for haskell. The main differences

  between this and "time" are that this library:


  * Uses machine integers where possible. This means that some time-related

  arithmetic should be faster. It also means that the types are incapable

  of representing times that are very far in the future or the past.


  * Provides "ToJSON" and "FromJSON" instances for json serialization.


  * Provides "Unbox" instances for working with unboxed vectors.


  * Uses normal non-overloaded haskell functions for encoding and decoding time. It
  provides

  "attoparsec" parsers for both "Text" and "ByteString". Additionally, it

  provides functions for encoding time as "Text" or "ByteString". The "time"

  library uses accomplishes these with the "Data.Time.Format" module,

  which uses UNIX-style datetime format strings. It is expected that

  the approach taken in this library is faster and catches more mistakes

  at compile time at the cost of being less expressive.


  * Only provides nanosecond resolution instead of picosecond resolution.'
