  # Snail

  A no-semantics programming language for gastropods.

  ## Why?

  My colleagues and I are going to start working through [Types and Programming
  Languages][tapl]. In the book you implement languages of varying feature sets.
  The book implements these languages in OCaml, however I had this Lisp parser
  essentially ready for awhile. There are a handful of "Write you a Scheme
  Interpreters"-like tutorials and they all use a parser relatively similar to
  this one. However, there are some pretty subtle issues with most of the ones I
  have seen. For example, the two examples below parse as two lexemes in a lot of
  examples. Even Haskell's parser has [this issue][haskell-parse-issue]!

  ```
  (1a)
  (1 a)
  ```

  ## Is this really a programming language?

  From the ["Programming language" Wikipedia page][pl-wikipedia],

  > A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.

  > The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning)

  Snail is used for writing interpreters or compilers. However, it doesn't define
  **any** semantics. So, maybe?

  ## Syntax (form)

  Snail describes valid lexemes, text literals, and s-expressions. The valid
  lexemes are approximately from R5RS Scheme but this may change in the future.
  We also use Haskell's line and block comments. Here is a valid snail program,

  ```
  -- Prints `hello "world"` to the console
  (print "hello \"world\"")

  -- Prints 3 to the console
  (print (+ 1 2))

  {-
    Defines a function to add two numbers
    Applies the function to generate 3
    Prints 3 to the console
  -}
  (let
    (f (lambda (x y) (+ x y)))
    (print (f 2 1)))

  (quote hello)

  (nil)

  (print true)

  (print false)

  -- end comment
  ```

  Reminder, this program has no semantics. It is your job to take Snail's
  Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and define the semantics of an interpreter or
  compiler.

  ## Getting the AST

  You have two options: `readSnailFile` or `parseSnail`.

  `readSnailFile` can be used like this, assuming you have put some valid snail
  into a file `./hello.snail`,

  ```haskell
  import Snail

  printSnail :: IO ()
  printSnail = do
    eResults <- readSnailFile "./hello.snail"
    case eResults of
      Right ast -> print ast
      Left failureString -> print failureString
  ```

  `parseSnail` doesn't require `IO` the only parameter is `Text`. This is useful
  for one-line programs, e.g.,

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

  import Snail

  example :: Either String [SnailAst]
  example = parseSnail "(print false)"
  ```

  ## Example Interpreters
