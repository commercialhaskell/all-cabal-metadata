  # Welcome to snappy

  snappy is a fast Haskell library for working with data compressed
  using Google's Snappy format.  It is implemented as a binding to the
  [Snappy library](http://code.google.com/p/snappy/).

  It implements zero-copy compression and decompression of both strict
  and lazy [bytestring](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring)s,
  the standard Haskell types for managing binary data efficiently.
