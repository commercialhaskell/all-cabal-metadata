description: "** How To install :\n\n1) go to the extracted directory \"snake-game-1.1\"\n\n2)
  on terminal , fire the following commands :\n      $ sudo runhaskell Setup.hs configure\n
  \     $ sudo runhaskell Setup.hs build\n      $ sudo runhaskell Setup.hs install\n\n3)
  to check if the package is installed into ghci, do the following :\n      $ ghci\n
  \     prelude> :module SnakeGame\n\n   If you will reach something like \"prelude
  SnakeGame>\" in haskell then you can say that the package is properly installed.\n\n4)
  well, game is ready to play now :\n\n** How to play :\n\n1) we have three modules
  : \n\t\tSnakeGame.Game\n\t\tSnakeGame.Idle\n\t\tSnakeGame.Keyboard\n\n2) last 2
  modules are supporting modules where our concern is SnakeGame.Game. So we will load
  this module.\n\n3) Prelude> :module SnakeGame.Game \n   Prelude SnakeGame.Game>
  startGame  \n\n4) A game will start with a fullscreen. By pressing any of the four
  arrow keys, snake will start running. By using arrow keys player will have to give
  the directions to the snake.\n\n  Note : Since snake is always hungry, it will be
  running always on the screen in the search of food.\n"
