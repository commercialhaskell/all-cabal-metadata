synopsis: A library for BDD-style testing with the Snap Web Framework
changelog: ! "0.6.0.0 - 2014-7-8 - Add additional helpers, and use much faster method
  of running tests.\n  * The biggest change is because of a patch to snap that allows
  us to only run the\n\tinitializer once for an entire test suite, which can easily
  be an order of\n\tmagnitude (or more) speedup.\n  * Also add a test-suite to the
  library.\n\n0.5.0.0 - Not released to hackage - Redesign library around richer types
  and Applicative.\n  * Basic building block is should/shouldNot, which lift a pure
  test function\n\tinto the SnapTesting monad.\n  * get / post create rich response
  type.\n  * Add html / css matcher predicates.\n\n0.4.1.1 - 2014-3-20 - Add this
  changelog to hackage, grammar in comments.\n\n0.4.1.0 - 2014-3-20 - Add form tests,
  assert.\n  * Add form test utility that runs digestive forms against values and
  checks that they\n\teither produce a given value (one form of test) or produce a
  set of errors\n\tspecified by the paths to the form.\n  * Add assert that lifts
  a Bool into a TestPass or TestFail.\n\n0.4.0.0 - 2014-3-20 - Change interface to
  a conf, and add TestError variant,\n\tfor when tests don't fail, but have an unexpected
  error. This breaks\n\tthe API.\n\n0.3.0.0 - 2014-3-5 - Switch to streaming interface
  for report generators.\n * Streams uses io-streams (a soon-to-be dependency of snap),
  and allow\n\ttest results to be reported immediately, not only at the end of the
  test run.\n\n0.2.1.0 - 2014-2-11 - Add support for get requests with parameters.\n\n0.2.0.1
  - 2014-2-3 - Fix bug in redirectsto.\n  * redirectsto would try to get the location
  header using a partial function\n\tregardless of whether it was a redirect, causing
  the whole test suite\n\tto fail.\n\n\n0.2.0.0 - 2014-1-13 - Renaming root.\n  *
  Snap.Testing becomes Snap.Test.BDD, as per comment by @gregorycollins.\n\n0.1.0.0
  - 2014-1-13 - Initial release\n"
