description: |-
  The Snowball library is used to compute the stems of words
  in natural languages.

  Compared to the older <stemmer> package, this one:

  * Correctly handles unicode without relying on the system
  locale

  * Takes greater care to avoid memory leaks and to be thread
  safe

  * Uses Text rather than String

  * Gets rid of the need for @stemWords@ by using rewrite
  rules to make @map stem@ efficient

  * Includes a more recent release of Snowball

  * Attempts to comply with the Snowball licensing terms

  * Supports @SafeHaskell@ when available and is otherwise
  @Haskell2010@

  * Comes with a test suite

  However, although this code is written from scratch, it is
  heavily modeled after the code of the \"stemmer\" package.
