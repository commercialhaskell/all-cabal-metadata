  Bindings to L-BFGS-B, Fortran code for limited-memory quasi-Newton bound-constrained optimization.

  L-BFGS-B is a Fortran library for limited-memory quasi-Newton bound-constrained optimization written
  by Ciyou Zhu, Richard Byrd, Jorge Nocedal and Jose Luis Morales. More information can be found on its
  homepage <http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~nocedal/lbfgsb.html>, or in [1].

  The L-BFGS-B Fortran code is not included in this package, as I consider it a dependency. This package expects to
  be able to link against version 3.0 of the L-BFGS-B code, as built by a relatively recent version of gfortran.
  Instructions on how to build L-BFGS-B as a shared library
  can be found at <http://nonempty.org/software/haskell-l-bfgs-b>.

  The functions provided in this package wrap FFI calls in 'unsafePerformIO', which among other things means that
  the called L-BFGS-B code should not output anything. The relevant @iprint@ flag is thus set negative to suppress
  output as specified in the L-BFGS-B code. However, there are two places in said code where the flag is ignored
  and output still occurs. If it bothers you that code exposed as pure prints things, see
  <http://nonempty.org/software/haskell-l-bfgs-b> for information on a simple patch for L-BFGS-B. The SciPy project
  has described the same behavior in <https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/2261>.

  The code assumes that your Haskell compiler's Doubles are IEEE-754 doubles.

  Example on usage can be found in the included @examples@ directiory.

  The current version has only been lightly tested, and should not be trusted for serious work. Feedback is appreciated.

  Changes in version 0.1.0.1:

  * Check some function arguments for sanity and cause a runtime error otherwise.

  * Add note above on double representation.

  * Added TODO below.

  Changes in version 0.1:

  * There has only been cursory testing, so do not trust these bindings yet.

  * Initial release.

  TODO:

  * Be more generic with regards to vector types?
