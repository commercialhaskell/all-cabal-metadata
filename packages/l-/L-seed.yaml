description: |-
  The players of this game will write code (the „genome“) that describes
  how plants (the biological type, not the industrial) will grow. The
  plants will grow simultaneously on the screen (the „garden“), will
  compete for light and will multiply. The players can not change the
  code of a growing plant, but they do have the chance to update their
  code for the next generation -- when a plant drops a seed, it will run
  the newest code. All in all, the game aims to be slowly paced and
  relaxing, something to just watch for a while and something that does
  not need constant attention by the players.

  This package contains the haskell programs, i.e. the game simulation
  with the visual display. It can be used to locally test the plants.
