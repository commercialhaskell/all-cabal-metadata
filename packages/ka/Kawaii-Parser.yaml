description: |-
  This library provides a simple tokeniser and parser. Its main focus is not efficiency but simplicity of implementation and
  use. The choice operator for parsers is symmetric, avoiding the need to think about the order in which the alternatives are
  listed. The library supports adding locations to the parse tree and aims to provide reasonably detailed information about
  parse errors with minimal user involvement. It also contains a module with type synonyms for some compositions of monad
  transformers.
