description: |-
  The library provides a tiny general utilities module, and a simple combinator-based tokeniser and parser. Its main focus is
  not efficiency but simplicity of implementation and use. The choice operator for parsers is symmetric, avoiding the need to
  think about the order in which the alternatives are listed. The library provides error locations and supports adding locations
  to the parse tree.
