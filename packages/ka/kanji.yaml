changelog: |
  ## 3.4.0

  - Removed `adultDen` and fixed the level range for `highDen`.

  ## 3.3.0

  - New `Unknown` level for Kanji above level `Two`
  - `level` is now a total function
  - Removed `averageLevel`, as it wasn't correct nor useful
  - New `densities` function with associated type `CharCat` for getting more
    interesting character density information

  ## 3.2.1

  - `ToJSON` and `FromJSON` instances for `Kanji` derived via `Generic`
    instead of being hand-written.

  ## 3.2.0

  - `averageLevel` isn't total, and so now returns in `Maybe`

  ## 3.1.0.1

  - Performance improvements

  ## 3.1.0

  - Overall simplification of library and reduction in boilerplate
    - `AsKanji` typeclass removed
    - `Rank` and `Level` are now just `Level`
    - More liberal use of `Map` and `Set`
  - `nanq` renamed to `kanji` and moved inside same project

  ## 2.0.0

  - New JSON-only output
  - Revamped, modernized backend

  Kanji
  ====

  `kanji` is a Japanese Kanji library and analysation program written in Haskell. Its main
  function is to tell what Kanji belong to what Level of the Japanese National
  Kanji Examination (漢字検定).

  `kanji` can be used to:
   - determine what Level individual Kanji belong to
   - determine the average Level (difficulty, in other words) of a group of Kanji
   - apply the above to whole files of Japanese

  INSTALLING `kanji`
  ---------------
  First, get the source files from:

  https://github.com/fosskers/kanji

  `kanji` is written in Haskell and uses the
  [stack](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README.html) tool. Once
  `stack` is installed, move to the source directory and perform:

      stack install

  USAGE
  -----
  Assuming you've made it so that you can run the executable, the following
  command-line options are available:

  ```
  Usage: kanji [-d|--density] [-e|--elementary] [-l|--leveldist] [-s|--splits]
               ((-f|--file ARG) | JAPANESE)

  Available options:
    -h,--help                Show this help text
    -d,--density             Find how much of the input is made of Kanji
    -e,--elementary          Find density of Kanji learnt in elementary school
    -l,--leveldist           Find the distribution of Kanji levels
    -s,--splits              Show which Level each Kanji belongs to
    -f,--file ARG            Take input from a file
  ```

  #### NOTES ON CLOs
   * All options above can be mixed to include their analysis result
   in the output JSON.
   * `-h` will over-ride any other options or arguments, discarding them and
     printing a help message.

  #### Examples
  *Single Kanji*
  ```
  $> kanji -s 日
  {
      "levelSplit": {
          "Ten": [
              "日"
          ]
      }
  }
  ```

  *A Japanese sentence*
  ```
  $> kanji -s これは日本語
  {
      "levelSplit": {
          "Nine": ["語"],
          "Ten": ["本", "日"]
      }
  }
  ```

  *All options*
  ```
  $> kanji -sled これは日本語。串と糞
  {
      "levelSplit": {
          "Nine": ["語"],
          "Ten": ["本", "日"],
          "Unknown": ["糞"],
          "Two": ["串"]
      },
      "elementary": 0.6,
      "density": 0.5,
      "distributions": {
          "Nine": 0.2,
          "Ten": 0.4,
          "Unknown": 0.2,
          "Two": 0.2
      }
  }
  ```
