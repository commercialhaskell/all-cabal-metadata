  Unofficial CLI client for the Kattis online judge system (currently in BETA).

  Written in a git-like fashion, it supports automatic
  downloading of test cases, easy submissions, and more.

  Basically a problem is initialized as follows
  (creates a directory and downloads any available test cases):

  > > katt init hello
  > > cd hello

  Source files, problem names, and language identification is handled
  automatically when submitting solutions:

  > > vim hello.java
  > > katt submit
  > Made submission 4712
  > Accepted: 1 of 1 test(s) passed

  There is also built-in support for problem sessions,
  which initalizes all problems in the problem list.

  Get started by downloading a /.kattisrc/ config from
  the official site, make sure you have the haskell platform
  installed, then run /cabal install katt/.

  Please note that the beta release is limited to C, C++, Java, and Haskell.
  It also only supports running on unix.

  Changes since last release:

  * Support for Haskell submissions

  * HTTP client replaced with wreq

  * Improved code readability
