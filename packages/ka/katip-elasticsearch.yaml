synopsis: ElasticSearch scribe for the Katip logging framework.
changelog: ! "0.5.0.0\n=======\n* Update template for ESv1 to not analyze certain
  fields like host and\n  namespace. These are not fields that benefit from tokenization.
  If\n  you're on ESv1, after running `mkEsScribe`, the logs template will\n  be updated
  to stop analyzing those fields. That means the next\n  index that is cut (e.g. tomorrow's
  logs if you're using daily index\n  sharding) will no longer analyze some fields.\n\n0.4.2.0\n=======\n*
  Allow newer bloodhound, aeson, async.\n\n0.4.1.0\n=======\n* Fix bug where index
  was created in `mkEsScribe` when it would not be used due to index sharding.\n*
  Update some index settings if index already exists and sharding is not used.\n*
  For ES V5 and higher, stop using the deprecated (and in 6.x, removed) `string` type
  for index templates, instead using `text` and `keyword` as appropriate. This makes
  `katip-elasticsearch` compatible with ES 6.x.\n\n0.4.0.4\n=======\n* Allow http-types
  0.12\n\n0.4.0.3\n=======\n* Fix benchmark and test builds for stackage nightly\n\n0.4.0.2\n=======\n*
  Add repository/homepage info to cabal file\n\n0.4.0.1\n=======\n* Bump dependencies
  to allow GHC 8.2.1\n\n0.4.0.0\n=======\n* Update to bloodhound >= 0.13.0.0. This
  version adds support for both ElasticSearch versions 1 and 5. Previously, we implicitly
  supported one and maybe would work on 5. The types in `EsScribeCfg` had to change
  to be able to specify which version was being targeted.\n* Improved documentation.\n\n0.3.1.0\n=======\n*
  Widen dependency on katip\n\n0.3.0.2\n=======\n* Loosen deps on aeson to allow 1.1.0.0\n\n0.3.0.1\n=======\n*
  Loosen deps on bloodhound, aeson, and http-client.\n\n0.3.0.0\n==============\n*
  Added zero padding to date-based indices. This shouldn't negatively\n  impact most
  users but to be safe, this was put behind a breaking\n  version number. Previously,
  you may see indices\n  `log-index-prefix-2016-1-2`. That index will now be\n  `log-index-prefix-2016-01-02`,
  so at worst when you deploy, the day\n  of the change will have 2 indices: one zero-padded
  and one not. If\n  you are using custom index sharding, you will not be affected
  by\n  this. The reasoning here is that most existing elasticsearch tools\n  such
  as `curator` expects date indices to be zero padded. By\n  switching to the standard,
  users can easily get log rotation and\n  other features from `curator` rather than
  having to roll their own\n  or add them to Katip.\n\n0.2.1.0\n==============\n\n*
  Drop direct dependency on random, upgrade uuid to >= 1.3.12 for\n  safer id generation.
  Previously, UUID was using randomIO, which uses\n  the system clock as a seed. So
  if multiple nodes happened to start\n  at the same time, they would produce conflicting
  UUID sequences.\n\n0.2.0.0\n==============\n\n* Default index sharding policy to
  daily. Previously it was no\n  sharding. The reasoning here is that no sharding
  creates very large\n  indices which become very difficult to manage in\n  production.
  Rotating data out on a time basis is very slow compared\n  to deleting date-based
  indices.\n\n  Upgrade note: if you were using the defaults before and switch to\n
  \ daily, rather than having the index name of `my-index`, you'll start\n  seeing
  `my-index-2016-3-14`. The good news is that whatever you're\n  using to use to search
  against your logs (such as kibana) will\n  support index patterns, so just use the
  pattern of `my-index*` to\n  get everything. Eventually if you have a retention
  period, you can\n  manually delete the `my-index` index without disruption.\n\n\n0.1.1.0\n==============\n\n*
  Set upper bounds for a few dependencies.\n\n0.1.0.0\n==============\n\n* Initial
  release\n"

description: ! "# Katip Elasticsearch [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Soostone/katip.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Soostone/katip)\n\nkatip-elasticsearch
  is a scribe for the Katip logging framework that\nsends structured logs to ElasticSearch.\n\n##
  Features\n\n* Built in bounded buffering.\n\n* Configurable pool of logging workers
  to help with high write\n  volume.\n\n* Optional field type annotation to avoid
  mistyping values.\n\n* Optional automatic date sharding, so logs can be filed into
  monthly,\n  weekly, daily, hourly, every minute indices. You can even specify\n
  \ your own index routing logic. This pattern can be seen in the ELK\n  stack as
  a way of keeping indexes reasonably sized and easy to\n  optimize, rotate, and manage.\n\n*
  Customizable retry policy for temporary outages and errors.\n\n* Automatic index
  and mapping setup.\n\n"
