changelog: |
  0.7.0.0
  =======
  * Make compatible with unreleased bloodhound 0.17
  * Deprecate use of ES version 1 which has been removed from bloodhound
    0.17. All users should move over to ESV5 which should work for
    versions 5 and up.
  * Default configuration to ESV5
  * Add deprecation warnings for ESV1. Support for ESV1 will be removed
    in the future.

  0.6.0.0
  =======
  * Update to katip-0.8.0.0 `PermitFunc` convention. To update, for
    example, if you were passing `InfoS` to `mkEsScribe` to filter
    severities, instead you should pass `(permitItem InfoS)`.
  * Update examples to add necessary type signature for the default
    scribe config.
  * Bugfix: the default error retry policy was much more rapid than
    documented.
  * Internally switch to safe-exceptions from encolosed-exceptions.

  0.5.1.1
  =======
  * Loosen katip dep

  0.5.1.0
  =======
  * Loosen deps

  0.5.0.0
  =======
  * Update template for ESv1 to not analyze certain fields like host and
    namespace. These are not fields that benefit from tokenization. If
    you're on ESv1, after running `mkEsScribe`, the logs template will
    be updated to stop analyzing those fields. That means the next
    index that is cut (e.g. tomorrow's logs if you're using daily index
    sharding) will no longer analyze some fields.

  0.4.2.0
  =======
  * Allow newer bloodhound, aeson, async.

  0.4.1.0
  =======
  * Fix bug where index was created in `mkEsScribe` when it would not be used due to index sharding.
  * Update some index settings if index already exists and sharding is not used.
  * For ES V5 and higher, stop using the deprecated (and in 6.x, removed) `string` type for index templates, instead using `text` and `keyword` as appropriate. This makes `katip-elasticsearch` compatible with ES 6.x.

  0.4.0.4
  =======
  * Allow http-types 0.12

  0.4.0.3
  =======
  * Fix benchmark and test builds for stackage nightly

  0.4.0.2
  =======
  * Add repository/homepage info to cabal file

  0.4.0.1
  =======
  * Bump dependencies to allow GHC 8.2.1

  0.4.0.0
  =======
  * Update to bloodhound >= 0.13.0.0. This version adds support for both ElasticSearch versions 1 and 5. Previously, we implicitly supported one and maybe would work on 5. The types in `EsScribeCfg` had to change to be able to specify which version was being targeted.
  * Improved documentation.

  0.3.1.0
  =======
  * Widen dependency on katip

  0.3.0.2
  =======
  * Loosen deps on aeson to allow 1.1.0.0

  0.3.0.1
  =======
  * Loosen deps on bloodhound, aeson, and http-client.

  0.3.0.0
  ==============
  * Added zero padding to date-based indices. This shouldn't negatively
    impact most users but to be safe, this was put behind a breaking
    version number. Previously, you may see indices
    `log-index-prefix-2016-1-2`. That index will now be
    `log-index-prefix-2016-01-02`, so at worst when you deploy, the day
    of the change will have 2 indices: one zero-padded and one not. If
    you are using custom index sharding, you will not be affected by
    this. The reasoning here is that most existing elasticsearch tools
    such as `curator` expects date indices to be zero padded. By
    switching to the standard, users can easily get log rotation and
    other features from `curator` rather than having to roll their own
    or add them to Katip.

  0.2.1.0
  ==============

  * Drop direct dependency on random, upgrade uuid to >= 1.3.12 for
    safer id generation. Previously, UUID was using randomIO, which uses
    the system clock as a seed. So if multiple nodes happened to start
    at the same time, they would produce conflicting UUID sequences.

  0.2.0.0
  ==============

  * Default index sharding policy to daily. Previously it was no
    sharding. The reasoning here is that no sharding creates very large
    indices which become very difficult to manage in
    production. Rotating data out on a time basis is very slow compared
    to deleting date-based indices.

    Upgrade note: if you were using the defaults before and switch to
    daily, rather than having the index name of `my-index`, you'll start
    seeing `my-index-2016-3-14`. The good news is that whatever you're
    using to use to search against your logs (such as kibana) will
    support index patterns, so just use the pattern of `my-index*` to
    get everything. Eventually if you have a retention period, you can
    manually delete the `my-index` index without disruption.


  0.1.1.0
  ==============

  * Set upper bounds for a few dependencies.

  0.1.0.0
  ==============

  * Initial release

  # Katip Elasticsearch [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Soostone/katip.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Soostone/katip)

  katip-elasticsearch is a scribe for the Katip logging framework that
  sends structured logs to ElasticSearch.

  ## Features

  * Built in bounded buffering.

  * Configurable pool of logging workers to help with high write
    volume.

  * Optional field type annotation to avoid mistyping values.

  * Optional automatic date sharding, so logs can be filed into monthly,
    weekly, daily, hourly, every minute indices. You can even specify
    your own index routing logic. This pattern can be seen in the ELK
    stack as a way of keeping indexes reasonably sized and easy to
    optimize, rotate, and manage.

  * Customizable retry policy for temporary outages and errors.

  * Automatic index and mapping setup.
