description: ! 'Kawa is a small command-line tool to manage some key-value store in
  a single

  file. It manages files containing key-value pairs like the following. These

  files are meant to be human-readable.


  ```

  hostname = localhost

  port = 5432

  username = myuser

  password = secret

  database = mydb

  ```


  There are three commands supported by the executable: `get`, `set` and `replace`

  which, respectively, gets the value assigned to a key from a store, sets a new

  value to a key in a store and replaces all occurences of keys by their values in

  a file.


  This can be used to generate a file from a template and some secrets contained

  in such a store. For instance, a provisioning tool could create a file

  `config.template.yml` for some application containing its configuration with

  lines like `username: USERNAME` and the variables would be stored in

  `secrets.kawa`. Then, before launching the application, a systemd service could

  run `kawa replace secrets.kawa -i config.template.yml -o config.yml`.


  For more information, run `kawa --help`.'
