description: |-
  Kawa is a small command-line tool to manage some key-value store in a single
  file. It manages files containing key-value pairs like the following. These
  files are meant to be human-readable.

  ```
  hostname = localhost
  port = 5432
  username = myuser
  password = secret
  database = mydb
  ```

  There are three commands supported by the executable: `get`, `set` and `replace`
  which, respectively, gets the value assigned to a key from a store, sets a new
  value to a key in a store and replaces all occurences of keys by their values in
  a file.

  This can be used to generate a file from a template and some secrets contained
  in such a store. For instance, a provisioning tool could create a file
  `config.template.yml` for some application containing its configuration with
  lines like `username: USERNAME` and the variables would be stored in
  `secrets.kawa`. Then, before launching the application, a systemd service could
  run `kawa replace secrets.kawa -i config.template.yml -o config.yml`.

  For more information, run `kawa --help`.
