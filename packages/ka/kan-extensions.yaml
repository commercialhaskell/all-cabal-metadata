changelog: ! '5.0.2

  -----

  * Added `hoistCoyoneda`


  5.0.1

  -----

  * Removed some redundant constraints


  5

  -----

  * Move `Data.Functor.Kan.Rift` to `Data.Functor.Day.Curried`


  4.2.3

  -----

  * Builds clean on GHC 7.10


  4.2.2

  -----

  * `semigroupoids` 5 support


  4.2.1

  ---

  * Add `liftRift` and `lowerRift`


  4.2

  ---

  * Remove pointed dependency


  4.1.1

  ---

  * Added `Applicative` instance for `Day`

  * Added `Typeable` instance for `Codensity`


  4.1.0.1

  ----

  * Added `tagged` dependency


  4.1

  ---

  * Moved co- and contra- variant `Day` convolution from `contravariant` to here.
  Day convolution is intimately connected to `Rift`.


  4.0.3

  -----

  * Added `liftCoT0M`, `liftCoT1M`, `diter` and `dctrlM` for using `CoT w m` to model
  a state machine with states in `w` and effects in `m`.


  4.0.2

  -----

  * Made fixes necessary to work around changes in `ImpredicativeTypes` for GHC 7.8.1rc2


  4.0.1

  -----

  * Bug fix so we can compile on GHC 7.4


  4.0

  ---

  * Removed `keys` dependency

  * Now compatible with `adjunctions` 4.0


  3.7

  ---

  * Moved all the `Yoneda` variants around again.

  * Improved haddocks


  3.6.2

  -----

  * Added `Data.Functor.Contravariant.Yoneda` to complete the set of Yoneda embeddings/reductions.


  3.6.1

  -----

  * Added several missing isomorphisms


  3.6

  ---

  * `instance Monad m => MonadSpec (Yoneda m)`


  3.5.1

  -----

  * Fixed a bug in the signature for `composedRepToCodensity`.


  3.5

  ---

  * More combinators for `Rift`/`Lift`.

  * Added combinators for working with representable functors rather than just adjoint
  functors.

  * Split `Data.Functor.KanExtension` into `Data.Functor.Kan.Ran` and `Data.Functor.Kan.Lan`

  * Split `Data.Functor.KanLift` into `Data.Functor.Kan.Rift` and `Data.Functor.Kan.Lift`

  * Moved from `Data.Functor.Yoneda.Contravariant` to `Data.Functor.Yoneda.Reduction`
  adopting terminology from Todd Trimble.

  * Added various missing isomorphisms.

  * Greatly improved the Haddocks for this package stating laws and derivations where
  we can (especially for ''Rift'' and ''Ran'').


  3.3

  ---

  * Rift is now `Applicative`. Added `rap`.


  3.2

  ---

  * Added right and left Kan lifts under `Data.Functor.KanLift`.

  * Decreased reliance on the `Composition` class where unnecessary in the API


  3.1.2

  -----

  * Marked modules `Trustworthy` as required for `SafeHaskell` in the presence of
  these extensions.


  3.1.1

  -----

  * Refactored build system

  * IRC build-bot notification

  * Removed upper bounds on dependencies on my other packages


  3.1

  ---

  * Moved `Control.Monad.Free.Church` over to the `free` package instead and removed
  it from `kan-extensions`

  ==============


  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/kan-extensions.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/kan-extensions)
  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ekmett/kan-extensions.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ekmett/kan-extensions)


  This package provides tools for working with various Kan extensions and Kan lifts
  in Haskell.


  Among the interesting bits included are:


  * Right and left Kan extensions (`Ran` and `Lan`)

  * Right and left Kan lifts (`Rift` and `Lift`)

  * Multiple forms of the Yoneda lemma (`Yoneda`)

  * The `Codensity` monad, which can be used to improve the asymptotic complexity
  of code over free monads (`Codensity`, `Density`)

  * A "comonad to monad-transformer transformer" that is a special case of a right
  Kan lift. (`CoT`, `Co`)
