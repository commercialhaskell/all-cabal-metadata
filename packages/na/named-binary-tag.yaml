  # named-binary-tag

  A replacement for the old [nbt](https://github.com/acfoltzer/nbt) package, because that one has
  been defunct for 2 years due to missing a single-line fix.

  There are also a few improvements(?) made while I was at it:
  - You can choose between a version with or without label maps using `MapNbt` or `Nbt'` respectively.
  - Uses konsumlamm's [rrb-vector](https://github.com/konsumlamm/rrb-vector) package instead of a mix of lists and unboxed arrays for more well-rounded asymptotics.
  - `StrictData` is enabled.
  - Names of types and constructors are shortened a bit, with the reasoning that you should really be using qualified access for most of them.
  - The code is shorter and better documented now (not that it really needed any documentation...)
  - Less boilerplate is required to use it, at the expense of having `zlib` as a dependency. See below.

  ## Usage

  ```Haskell
  import Data.Nbt qualified as Nbt
  import Data.Serialize

  main :: IO ()
  main = do
    shouldBeNbt <- Nbt.readCompressed "level.dat" :: IO (Either String Nbt') -- see also "Nbt.readUncompressed"
    case shouldBeNbt of
      Left err -> putStrLn err
      Right nbt -> do
        print nbt
        Nbt.writeCompressed "anotherlevel.dat" nbt -- see also "Nbt.writeUncompressed"
  ```

  ## Possible Future Work

  - Drop the `cereal` dependency and do bytestring parsing directly.
  - Conversion to/from SNBT.
  - Conversion to/from JSON.
