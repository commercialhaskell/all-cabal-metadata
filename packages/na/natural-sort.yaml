description: |-
  The built-in comparisons for textual data are based on Unicode ordinals. This
  does not match most every-day sorting algorithms. For example,
  \"z10.txt\" is sorted after \"z2.txt\" by users, but before it by
  na&#239;ve algorithms.

  This package provides an implementation of \"natural sort\", which more
  closely matches user expectations.
