description: |2-

  A plain String or Text is dangerous because it can be arbitrarily combined,
  converted, emitted, and updated without consideration of the validity and
  applicability of the contents and the usage scenario.

  This module provides a Named type wrapper around Text which has two
  additional type parameters: one which indicates what the content of the Text
  represents, and one which indicates the style of the name.

  There are additionally functions and classes which allow conversions and
  transformations between names with different styles and types (or disallow them
  where appropriate).

  The core intent of this library is that the Named is used instead of a raw
  String or Text to provide type-level tracking and safety.
