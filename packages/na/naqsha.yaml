  Naqsha is a Haskell library to work with geospatial data types. The
  goal of this library is to provide fast and high level access to
  various operations in the geospatial setting like distance
  calculations, azimuth etc. Due to the very nature of the geometry on
  the surface of the globe, many of these basic tasks have multiple
  algorithms based on criteria like speed of computation and
  accuracy. We would like to provide all such algorithms in this
  package.

  The word naqsha, or more accurately naqshA (नक़्शा), means a map or a
  sketch.
