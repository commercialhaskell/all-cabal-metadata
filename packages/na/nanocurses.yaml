description: |-
  This is a simple binding to the Curses library, a common
  Unix library which allows you to use a terminal as a
  canvas on which your paint are characters (instead of line
  by line output); Curses is probably most useful for rogue-like
  interfaces.

  Nanocurses differs from Hscurses and Mage in that it is
  intended to be portable to Curses libraries other than Ncurses, such
  as Ocurses, Irix's curses, and so on. So it may not have all their features.
  (It does not differ significantly from Hmp3's Curses binding, as the Curses.hsc
  in Nanocurses is essentially extracted from Hmp3.)
