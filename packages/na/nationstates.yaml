  # NationStates for Haskell [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/lfairy/nationstates.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/lfairy/nationstates)

  [NationStates] is an online government simulation game, created by Max Barry. The site generates a wealth of data, some of which can be accessed through its [official API].

  This library lets you query this API using the Haskell programming language.

  [NationStates]: https://nationstates.net
  [official API]: https://www.nationstates.net/pages/api.html


  ## Features

  * **Type safe**: you can't refer to a shard unless you explicitly request it.

  * **Automatic rate limiting**, which can be disabled or overridden if you want.

  * **HTTPS support** via the [tls] library.

  * **Free and open source** under the Apache License, version 2.0.

  [tls]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tls


  ## Dependencies

  * GHC 7.6 or newer


  ## Installation

  `nationstates` is hosted on [Hackage].

      cabal install nationstates

  [Hackage]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nationstates


  ## Example

  ```haskell
  import NationStates
  import qualified NationStates.Nation as Nation
  import Text.Printf

  main = do
      c <- newContext "ExampleBot/2000"
      (name, motto) <- Nation.run "Montesardo-East Adanzi" shards c
      printf "%s has the motto: %s\n" name motto
    where
      shards = (,) <$> Nation.name <*> Nation.motto
  ```
