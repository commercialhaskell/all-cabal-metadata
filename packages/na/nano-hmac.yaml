  INTRO

  nano-hmac follows in the footsteps of dons' nano-md5 library in an attempt
  to create a minimal library that provides access to the HMAC capability
  of OpenSSL.

  The intent of the library is to be focused just on HMAC.

  It is a working release and does pass the tests outlined in RFC's 2104 and 2202.


  INSTALL

    % runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
    % runhaskell Setup.lhs build
    % runhaskell Setup.lhs haddock
    % sudo runhaskell Setup.lhs install


  NOTES

  You may encounter problems building the documentation if you're using
  a version of haddock before version 2.0.0.0.


  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

  Many good ideas regarding implementation and testing have been borrowed
  from Don Stewart's (dons) nano-md5 library.  Anything that is buggy or
  doesn't make sense would be my own unique contribution.
