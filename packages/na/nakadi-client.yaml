  About\n\n`nakadi-client` is a BSD2/BSD3 licensed Haskell client library for\ninteracting
  with the [Nakadi event\nbroker](https://zalando.github.io/nakadi/) system developed
  by\n[Zalando](https://github.com/zalando). The streaming is built on top\nof [Conduit](https://haskell-lang.org/library/conduit).\n\nPlease
  note that the **API is not considered stable yet**.\n\n`nakadi-client` provides:\n\n-
  Docker based test suite testing against the official Nakadi [docker\n  image](https://github.com/zalando/nakadi#running-a-server)
  (in\n  progress).\n\n- A rather direct translation of Nakadi's REST API to Haskell.
  Thus,\n  if you are familiar with Nakadi's REST API, the API exposed by\n  `nakadi-client`
  will feel very familiar.\n\n- Where suitable, `nakadi-client` provides *additional*
  higher-level\n  interfaces.\n\n- A type-safe API for interacting with Nakadi. For
  example, the name\n  of an event type has type `EventTypeName`, not `Text` or something\n
  \ generic.\n\n- Integrated and configurable retry mechanism.\n\n- Conduit based
  interfaces for streaming events.\n\n- Convenient Subscription API interface (`subscriptionSource`
  &\n  `runSubscription`), which frees the user from any manual bookkeeping\n  of
  the Subscription Stream ID necessary for commiting cursors.\n\n- Mechanism for registering
  callbacks for logging and token injection.\n\n- Correct types for values like `CursorOffset`
  (which must be treated\n  as opaque strings).\n\n- Basically each API function is
  exposed in two versions: One which\n  requires the caller to pass in a Nakadi configuration
  value\n  containing the information about how to connect to Nakadi and one\n  which
  is suffixed with `R` (think: Reader monad), which expects to\n  find the Nakadi
  configuration in the environment provided by a\n  reader monad in your application's
  monad stack.\n\n### Example\n\nExample using the Subscription API:\n\n```haskell\nimport
  qualified Network.Nakadi as Nakadi\n\nprocessSubscription :: Nakadi.SubscriptionId
  -> IO ()\nprocessSubscription subscriptionId = do\n  runResourceT $ do\n    (connection,
  source) <- Nakadi.subscriptionSource config Nothing subscriptionId\n    Nakadi.runSubscription
  config connection $\n      source .| iterMC processEvent .| Nakadi.subscriptionSink\n```\n"
