description: |-
  `named` is a lightweight library for named function parameters (keyword
  arguments) based on overloaded labels. Keyword arguments have several
  advantages over positional arguments:

  * they can be supplied in arbitrary order
  * their names serve as documentation at call site
  * it is impossible to accidentally mix them up

  Unlike @newtype@ wrappers, keyword arguments don't pollute the global
  namespace, don't require top-level definitions, and don't need to be
  exported.

  This implementation of named parameters is typesafe, provides good type
  inference, descriptive type errors, and has no runtime overhead.

  Example usage:

  > import Named
  >
  > createSymLink :: "from" :! FilePath -> "to" :! FilePath -> IO ()
  > createSymLink (Arg from) (Arg to) = ...
  >
  > main = createSymLink ! #from "/path/to/source"
  >                      ! #to "/target/path"
