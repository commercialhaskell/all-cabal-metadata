  [![GitHub CI](https://github.com/adetokunbo/tmp-proc/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/adetokunbo/tmp-proc/actions)

  `tmp-proc` is a small library designed to simplify integration tests that use
  services running on docker.

  This README contains a _How to_ tutorial on using this library. This tutorial
  explains step by step how to specify a docker image as a `tmp proc` and use it in
  a test.

  __N.B.__ It assumes that docker is installed.

  All code below can be compiled and run with the following commands:

  ```shell
  # At the moment (30/09/2021), this is does not consistently run when using cabal
  $ stack build tmp-proc
  $ stack run readme
  ```

  ## Preamble: imports and language extensions

  Since this is a literate haskell file, we need to specify all our language
  extensions and imports up front.

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds           #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE LambdaCase          #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings   #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications    #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies        #-}

  import           Test.Hspec

  import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as C8
  import           Data.List             (foldl')
  import           Data.Proxy            (Proxy (..))
  import           Data.Text             (Text)
  import qualified Data.Text             as Text
  import           Network.HTTP.Req

  import           System.TmpProc        (HList (..), HandlesOf, HostIpAddress,
                                          Pinged (..), Proc (..), ProcHandle (..),
                                          SvcURI, manyNamed, startupAll, toPinged,
                                          (&:), ixPing, nameOf, terminateAll)

  ```


  ## Specify a Proc instance

  In `tmp-proc`, docker instances are specified by making new instances of the
  `Proc` typeclass.

  For this tutorial, we'll test the famous [http-bin](https://httpbin.org)
  service. Although it's an online service in it's own right, it is also available
  as a docker image.


  ```haskell
  data HttpBinLhs = HttpBinLhs

  instance Proc HttpBinLhs where
    type Image HttpBinLhs = "kennethreitz/httpbin"
    type Name HttpBinLhs = "http-bin-lhs"

    uriOf ip = "http://" <> C8.pack (Text.unpack ip) <> "/"
    runArgs = []
    reset _ = pure ()
    ping = pingImpl

  ```

  A `Proc` instance specifies both an `Image` and `Name`.
  - The `Image` corresponds to the docker image that needs to be run
  - The `Name` is a label that needs to be unique; it is used an alternate index for the Proc instance.

  The instance also specifies a number of useful typeclass functions; only `ping`
  will be covered in this tutorial, but the others all have important roles.


  ```haskell

  pingImpl :: ProcHandle a -> IO Pinged
  pingImpl handle = toPinged @HttpException Proxy $ do
    gotStatus <- runReq defaultHttpConfig $ do
      r <- req GET (handleUrl handle "/status/200") NoReqBody ignoreResponse $ mempty
      pure $ responseStatusCode r
    if (gotStatus == 200) then pure OK else pure NotOK


  handleUrl :: ProcHandle a -> Text -> Url 'Http
  handleUrl handle urlPath = foldl' (/:) (http $ hAddr handle)
    $ Text.splitOn "/" $ Text.dropWhile (== '/') urlPath


  ```

  The `pingImpl` used by the `Proc` instance above is implemented next.

  Each `Proc` instance must provide a valid `ping` implementation, `tmp-proc` uses
  `ping` to determine when the `Proc's` service is ready for use in the test.

  ## Using the Proc


  ```haskell

  spec :: Spec
  spec = describe ("Tmp.Proc: " ++ Text.unpack (nameOf HttpBinLhs)) $ do
    beforeAll (startupAll $ HttpBinLhs &: HNil) $ afterAll terminateAll $ do
      context "When accessing the services in the list of test tmp procs" $ do

        context "ixPing" $ do

          it "should succeed when accessing a Proc by name" $ \handles
            -> ixPing @"http-bin-lhs" Proxy handles `shouldReturn` OK

          it "should succeed when accessing a Proc by type" $ \handles
            -> ixPing @HttpBinLhs Proxy handles `shouldReturn` OK

  ```

  With just this, it's now possible to write a simple test showing various
  features of `tmp-proc`.  E.g,

  - `hspec` launches `Procs` during test setup

     - this results in an `HList` of `ProcHandle` types being passed to each test.

       - (In this example, the HList has only one `Proc`. `startupAll` allows for
         many `Procs` to started, each of different type. This is possible because
         `startupAll` acts on and returns a heteregenous list (or `HList`) rather
         than the usual `List` type.

     - `startupAll` takes an `HList` of `Procs` and returns an `HList` of
       corresponding `ProcHandle` types, first ensuring that all the corresponding
       docker services start up ok

  - once setup succeeds, each test is passed the `ProcHandles` created by
    `startupAll`

     - this is powered by a feature of [hspec][2], it's through use of `hspec's`
       `beforeAll` hook that enables this

      - `startupAll` is just one example of a `tmp-proc` combinator meshing well with
      the test frameworks' combinators.

          - the `startAll` and `terminateAll` functions used here also work with
            `tasty's` [withResource][6]

          - `tmp-proc` provides other functions that work with other hooks in [hspec][1]

  - the test cases here show the way that `tmp-proc` functions work with an
    `HList` of `ProcHandles`

      - `ixPing` uses [TypeApplications][7] with an index type to identify the
          'ProcHandle' to ping

      - `tmp-proc` provides similar functions that enable access to attributes
          of one or many `ProcHandle`.

      - Though not shown here, as well as accessing a `ProcHandle's` attributes,
        test code may also to access the corresponding service using a
        `Connection` type specific to that service.

      - __N.B.__ these test cases are completely unrealistic; there should be no
        reason to use `ixPing` in a normal test case! For slightly more realism,
        please take a look at the [example package][4].
