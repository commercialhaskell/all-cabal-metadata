description: |-
  @tmp-proc@ runs services in docker containers for use in integration tests.

  It aims to make using these services become like accessing /tmp/ processes,
  similar to how /tmp/ file or directories are used.

  It aspires to provide a user-friendly API, while including useful features
  such as

  * launch of multiple services on docker during test setup

  * delayed test execution until the launched services are available

  * simplified use of connections to the services from a [WAI](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai) server under test

  * good integration with haskell testing frameworks like [hspec](https://hspec.github.io)
  and [tasty](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty)
