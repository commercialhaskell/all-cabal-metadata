description: |-
  GNOME VFS is the GNOME virtual file system.  It is the foundation of the
  Nautilus file manager.  It provides a modular architecture and ships with
  several modules that implement support for local files, http, ftp and others.
  It provides an URI-based API, a backend supporting asynchronous file
  operations, a MIME type manipulation library and other features.
