description: |-
  A modular game engine and Entity-Component-System (ECS) for Haskell.
  An ECS is a modern approach to organizing your application state as a database,
  providing patterns for data-oriented design and parallel processing.
  Aztecs provides side-effect free components and systems,
  as well as backends for rendering and input (such as `aztecs-sdl`),
  allowing you to structure your game as simple function of `Input -> World -> World`.
