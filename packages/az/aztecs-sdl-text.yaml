description: |-
  The Entity-Component-System (ECS) pattern is commonly used in video game develop to represent world objects.
  ECS follows the principal of composition over inheritence. Each type of
  object (e.g. sword, monster, etc), in the game has a unique EntityId. Each
  entity has various Components associated with it (material, weight, damage, etc).
  Systems act on entities which have the required Components.
