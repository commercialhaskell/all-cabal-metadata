  # rounded-hw: Rounding control for built-in floating-point types

  This package provides directed rounding and interval arithmetic for built-in floating-point types (i.e. `Float`, `Double`).
  Unlike [rounded](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rounded), this package does not depend on an external C library.

  In addition to `Float` and `Double`, `LongDouble` from [long-double](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/long-double) package is supported on x86.
  There is also support for `Float128` from [float128](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/float128) package under a package flag.

  # API overview

  ## Controlling the rounding direction

  The type `RoundingMode` represents the four rounding directions.

  The type `Rounded (r :: RoundingMode) a` is a wrapper for `a`, with instances honoring the rounding direction given by `r`.

  ```haskell
  module Numeric.Rounded.Hardware where

  data RoundingMode
    = ToNearest     -- ^ Round to the nearest value (IEEE754 roundTiesToEven)
    | TowardNegInf  -- ^ Round downward (IEEE754 roundTowardNegative)
    | TowardInf     -- ^ Round upward (IEEE754 roundTowardPositive)
    | TowardZero    -- ^ Round toward zero (IEEE754 roundTowardZero)

  newtype Rounded (r :: RoundingMode) a = Rounded { getRounded :: a }

  instance ... => Num (Rounded r a)
  instance ... => Fractional (Rounded r a)
  instance ... => Real (Rounded r a)
  instance ... => RealFrac (Rounded r a)
  ```

  ## Interval arithmetic

  This library also provides basic interval types. See `Numeric.Rounded.Hardware.Interval` and `Numeric.Rounded.Hardware.Interval.NonEmpty`.

  # Usage

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE HexFloatLiterals #-}
  import Numeric
  import Numeric.Rounded.Hardware

  main = do
    putStrLn $ showHFloat (1 + 0x1p-100 :: Double) "" -- -> 0x1p0
    putStrLn $ showHFloat (1 + 0x1p-100 :: Rounded TowardInf Double) "" -- -> 0x1.0000000000001p0
  ```

  # Backends

  There are several options to control the rounding direction.

  * Pure Haskell (via `Rational`)
      * Very slow, but does not depend on FFI and therefore can be used on non-native backends.
      * This implementation is always available via a newtype in `Numeric.Rounded.Hardware.Backend.ViaRational`.
  * C FFI
      * One of the technologies below is used:
          * C99 (`fesetround`)
          * SSE2 (`_mm_setcsr`)
          * AVX512 EVEX encoding (`_mm_*_round_*`)
          * x87 Control Word (for x87 long double)
          * AArch64 FPCR
      * On x86_64, `foreign import prim` is used to provide faster interval addition/subtraction.

  By default, C FFI is used and an appropriate technology is detected.
  To disable use of C FFI, set `pure-hs` flag when building.

  The name of the backend used can be obtained with `Numeric.Rounded.Hardware.Backend.backendName`.

  ```haskell
  >>> backendName (Proxy :: Proxy Double)
  "FastFFI+SSE2"
  ```
