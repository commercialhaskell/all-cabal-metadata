description: |-
  The tool has a command line interface. It generates quarter profit
  reports out of Robin-Hood activity reports
  available in the CSV format. Quatities from such reports are important
  for estimating quarter prepayment to IRS during
  current tax year.  According to IRS guidline if you postope pay till
  next tax year (i.e Jan-Apr) and amount you owe is greater than $1k
  you may have to pay a penalty.

  In general any quarter report requires sequential processing of all
  history (shares might be bought at one year and sold a decade later)
  since a Robin-Hood account establishment preceding the target
  quater. This data aspect accents algorithm implementation on memory
  efficiency and throughput.

  See Readme file for details.
