synopsis: Open Records and Variants
changelog: "## 0.4.0.0 [2020-05-20]\r\n- Renamed `toNative` to `toNativeGeneral` and
  `toNativeExact` to `toNative` for records and likewise for `fromNative` for variants.\r\n-
  Added a type family `NativeRow` which, when given any generic type that can go through
  `fromNative`, is equal to the row-type of the resulting record/variant.  Note that
  `NativeRow` is defined separately (and differently!) for records vs variants, so
  it is exported at the `Data.Row.Records`/`Variants` level but not at `Data.Row`.\r\n-
  Added `coerceRec` and `coerceVar` to coerce the row-types of records and variants
  respectively.\r\n- Exposed `BiForall` in `Data.Row`, `Data.Row.Records`, and `Data.Row.Variants`\r\n-
  (Internal) Rewrote internal `Generic` code to use an associated type family instead
  of a standalone one.\r\n\r\nNote: GHC 8.2 and earlier are no longer supported in
  row-types 0.4.0.0.\r\n\r\n## 0.3.1.0 [2020-01-29]\r\n- Added \"native\" classes
  as exports for `Records` and `Variants` (e.g., `ToNative`, `FromNative`)\r\n- Added
  more example hs files.\r\n\r\n## 0.3.0.0 [2019-05-28]\r\n- Added `HasField` and
  `AsConstructor` instances (from generic-lens) for `Rec` and `Var` respectively.\r\n-
  Added record-overwrite function `.//`.\r\n- Added `Generic` instances for Rec and
  Var.\r\n- Added mapHas entailment connecting `Map f r .! l` to `r .! l`.\r\n- Changed
  `Forall2` to `BiForall`.\r\n  - Added `BiConstraint` type class for use  with `BiForall`.\r\n-
  Added `Ap` type family that functions as `ap` over rows using zipping.\r\n  - Added
  `mapF` to map a function over a record with an `Ap` row.\r\n- Added `toDynamicMap`
  and `fromDynamicMap` as functions to convert between `Rec`s and  `HashMap Text Dynamic`s.\r\n-
  Added `toNativeExact` to convert a `Rec` to a native Haskell type without losing
  any fields.\r\n- Added `toNative`, `fromNative`, and `fromNativeExact` for `Var`s.\r\n-
  Added `unSingleton` for `Var`s.\r\n  - Removed `unSingleton` from `Data.Row` export
  list.\r\n- Tightened the type signatures of `focus` (for both `Rec` and `Var`) to
  improve type inference when using `focus` in lens-like situations.\r\n\r\n## 0.2.3.1
  [2018-07-11]\r\n- Fix a bug in the `Show` instance for `Rec`.\r\n\r\n## 0.2.3.0
  [2018-07-02]\r\n- Update the `Show` instance for `Rec` to render valid code.\r\n-
  Add `toNative` and `fromNative` functions for records to easily convert between
  Haskell records and row-types records.\r\n- Make type families in `Data.Row.Internal`
  polykinded (thanks James Yu!)\r\n\r\n## 0.2.1.0 [2018-03-20]\r\n- Bug Fix: The type
  of `update` for both `Rec` and `Var` now enforce the newly inserted type is correct.\r\n-
  New: Add `restrict` and `split` for `Var`s.  \r\n  - Removed `restrict` from `Data.Row`
  export list.\r\n- New: Added support for universally quantified rows: `mapForall`
  and `uniqueMap`.\r\n- Added very simple test suite.\r\n\r\n## 0.2.0.0 [2018-02-12]\r\n-
  Initial Release\r\n"
