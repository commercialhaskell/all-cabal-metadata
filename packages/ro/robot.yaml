  The Haskell Robot
  =================

  **Robot** is a library for sending fake keyboard and mouse events using
  [Haskell][]. Applications will respond as though the user performed the
  actions themselves.

  [Haskell]: http://haskell.org/

  Only X11 systems are supported right now, but Windows and Mac can be
  added later if anyone cares.

  Here are some things you can do:

  * Test graphical interfaces and websites!

  * Play silly pranks on your friends!

  * Finally beat those [silly Flash games where you press the same button
    over and over again really fast][blah blah blah]. I don't like those.

  Quick start
  -----------

  First, download and install the library:

      git clone https://github.com/lfairy/robot.git
      cd robot
      cabal install

  Now try running some of the programs in the `examples` directory.


  TODO
  ----

  * Backends for Mac OS X, Windows, and Wayland

  * Screenshots

  * Actions currently run instantaneously, which can be an issue for some
    applications. Perhaps add a small delay between each operation like
    Java does.
