  # Robin

  Robin is a build daemon for Haskell development.

  ## Usage

      robin (start | stop | build | watch | debug)

  This daemon rebuilds a cabalized Haskell project whenever a source file
  changes. It runs one of the following commands:

  * `./robin.sh`, if that file exists, or
  * `stack build`, if `stack.yaml` exists, or
  * `cabal build`, otherwise.

  ## Commands

  * start - if the current project doesn't already have a daemon, start one
  * stop - stop the daemon for the current project
  * build - show the output of the last build, or if a build is in progress, wait
    for completion and then show its output
  * watch - take over the console, always showing the latest build output
  * debug - like _start_, but doesn't daemonize

  The default command is _build_.

  Note: the _current project_ is assumed to be the root of the git working copy
  which contains the current directory.  definition.


  ## Vim integration

      echo 'setlocal makeprg=robin' >> ~/.vim/ftplugin/haskell.vim
