  # Installation

  ```shell
  $ cabal install rob
  ```

  # Usage

  Before using Rob you need to create your projects templates.
  If for example you work often with nodejs you can create your `nodejs` template from scratch.
  Let's see then how to create a new Rob template.

  ## New Project Template Creation

  Create a folder anywhere on your machine.
  Put in this folder all the files/folders you want to use anytime you will chose this template.
  For example for the `nodejs` template you may have a folder structure that might look like this:

  ```
  nodejs
  │--package.json
  │--README.md
  │--travis.yml
  │--.gitignore
  └───src
  │   │--index.js
  └───test
      │--runner.js
      │--expect.js
  ```

  ### The `project.yml` file

  Rob relies on a single file that __you must include in the root of your templates folders__.
  This file is called __`project.yml`__

  For example, the `nodejs` template must also contain an additional `project.yml` file:

  ```
  nodejs
  │--project.yml
  │--package.json
  │--README.md
  ...
  ```

  The `project.yml` file will contain all the questions needed to copy and render your template files when you will chose that
  specific template.
  Depending on your answers to these questions Rob will be able to generate a (key, value) data
  map that will be used to shape your project files via [its template engine](#template-engine)

  A typical `project.yml` might look like this:

  ```yml
  questions:
    name:
      question: What's the name of the project?
      type: input
      default: foo

    description:
      question: Project description?

    test_framework:
      question: Which test framework do you want to use?
      type: select
      default: mocha
      answers:
        - mocha
        - jasmine
        - tap

    babel_preset:
      question: Which babel preset do you want to use?
      type: multiselect
      default:
        - babel-preset-env
      answers:
        - babel-preset-env
        - babel-preset-es2015
        - babel-preset-es2016
        - babel-preset-es2017

    is_public:
      question: Is it public?
      type: confirm

    password:
      question: What's your password?
      type: password
  ```

  The kind of answers types supported are only `input`, `confirm`, `select`, `multiselect` and `password`. The questionnaire prompt are powered by [fortytwo](https://github.com/GianlucaGuarini/fortytwo)

  ### Template engine

  Rob uses [EDE](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ede) as template engine.
  Any time you will create a new project with Rob, all the files of the template selected will be parsed rendered via EDE using the answers provided with the `project.yml`.
  For example the `package.json` in your `nodejs` template might be:

  ```
  {
    "name": "{{name}}",
    {% if is_public %}
      "public": true,
    {% endif %}
    ...
  }
  ```

  Please check the [EDE](http://brendanhay.nz/ede/Text-EDE.html) to see all the available expression. However if you have already used [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid) or [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/) it shouldn't be such a big deal

  ### Add the template to rob

  Once you have set up your new template you can link it to Rob via `rob add template-name path/to/the/template`
  Pay attention: __the path to your template should be absolute!__
  For example:

  ```shell
  rob add simple-node-js `/Users/WhoAmI/Projects/rob-templates/nodejs`
  ```

  The command above will store the template in a file called `.rob` in your home directory.

  ## Create a new project

  Run `rob new` from any folder on your machine and if you have Rob templates available, it will create your project running the questionnaire and copying the files of the template chosen in the current directory

  ### Autoignore files

  Rob will automatically parse any `.gitignore` recursively in your selected template folders to ignore specific files that you don't want to copy over when you create a new project
