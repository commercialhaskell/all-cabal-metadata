description: |-
  A miscellaneous collection of re-usable functions and data
  structures. Many of Rosso's modules are direct extensions of the
  Haskell base libraries; for example, Data.Map.Rosso1 extends
  Data.Map, Control.Monad.Rosso1 extends Control.Monad, etc.

  Rosso is designed to remain backward-compatible with any client code
  that works with an older version of itself. To this end, all module
  names include explicit version numbers.
