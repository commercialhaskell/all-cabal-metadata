changelog: |
  ## Changes in 3.2.5:

   * Build fixes for GHC 8.8.x

  ## Changes in 3.2.4:

   * Remove dependency on QuickCheck
   * Change the way that bootstrapping is done: see README.md for build
     instructions

  ## Changes in 3.2.3:

   * fix issue when using cpphs (#116)

  ## Changes in 3.2.2:

   * Manage line length in generated files [GH-84]
   * Fix issue when identifier with multiple single quotes, e.g. `foo''` was used
   * Allow omitting spaces around `=` in macro definitions
   * Include pre-generated Parser.hs and Scan.hs in the Hackage upload, to
     make bootstrapping easier.

  ## Changes in 3.2.1:

   * Fix build problem with GHC; add new test tokens_scan_user.x

  ## Changes in 3.2.0:

   * Allow the token type and productions to be overloaded, and add new
     directives: %token, %typeclass, %action.  See "Type Signatures and
     Typeclasses" in the manual.
   * Some small space leak fixes

  ##  Changes in 3.1.7:

   * Add support for `%encoding` directive
     (allows to control `--latin1` from inside Alex scripts)
   * Make code forward-compatible with in-progress proposals
   * Suppress more warnings

  ##  Changes in 3.1.6:

   * `sdist` for 3.1.5 was mis-generated, causing it to ask for Happy
      when building.

  ## Changes in 3.1.5:

   * Generate less warning-laden code, and suppress other warnings.
   * Bug fixes.

  ##  Changes in 3.1.4:

   * Add Applicative/Functor instances for GHC 7.10

  ##  Changes in 3.1.3:

   * Fix for clang (XCode 5)

  ##  Changes in 3.1.2:

   * Add missing file to extra-source-files

  ##  Changes in 3.1.1:

   * Bug fixes (#24, #30, #31, #32)

  ##  Changes in 3.1.0:

   * necessary changes to work with GHC 7.8.1

  ##  Changes in 3.0 (since 2.3.5)

   * Unicode support (contributed mostly by Jean-Philippe Bernardy,
     with help from Alan Zimmerman).

     * An Alex lexer now takes a UTF-8 encoded byte sequence as input
       (see Section 5.1, “Unicode and UTF-8”. If you are using the
       "basic" wrapper or one of the other wrappers that takes a
       Haskell String as input, the string is automatically encoded
       into UTF-8 by Alex. If your input is a ByteString, you are
       responsible for ensuring that the input is UTF-8 encoded. The
       old 8-bit behaviour is still available via the --latin1
       option.

     * Alex source files are assumed to be in UTF-8, like Haskell
       source files. The lexer specification can use Unicode
       characters and ranges.

     * `alexGetChar` is renamed to `alexGetByte` in the generated code.

     * There is a new option, `--latin1`, that restores the old
       behaviour.

   * Alex now does DFA minimization, which helps to reduce the size
     of the generated tables, especially for lexers that use Unicode.

description: "# Alex: A Lexical Analyser Generator\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/simonmar/alex.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/simonmar/alex)\n\nAlex
  is a Lex-like tool for generating Haskell scanners.  For complete\ndocumentation,
  see the doc directory.\n\n- <https://www.haskell.org/alex/>\n\n- <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/alex>\n\nAlex
  version 2.0 has changed fairly considerably since version 1.x,\nand the syntax is
  almost completely different.  For a detailed list of\nchanges, see the release notes
  in the documentation.\n\nAlex is now covered by a BSD-Style licence; see the licence
  file in\nthe 'doc' directory for details.\n\nThe sources are in the 'src' directory
  and the documentation in the 'doc'\ndirectory; various  examples are in the 'examples'
  subdirectory.\n\nThe source code in the 'src' and 'examples' directories is intended\nfor
  a Haskell 98 compiler with hierarchical modules.  It should work\nwith GHC >= 5.04.\n\n##
  Build Instructions\n\nIf you just want to *use* Alex, you can download or install
  (via\n`cabal install alex`) an\n[Alex release from Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/alex);
  also note that\ndistributions such as the\n[Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/)
  and other package\nmanager-based distributions provide packages for Alex. Moreover,\nrecent
  versions of `cabal` will automatically install the required\nversion of `alex` based
  on\n[`build-tools`/`build-tool-depends` declarations](http://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing-packages.html#pkg-field-build-tool-depends).\n\nRead
  on if you want to build Alex directly from Git.\n\nAlex is built using GHC & Cabal;
  so first install\n[GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc) and\n[`cabal-install-2.0`](https://www.haskell.org/cabal)
  (or later).\n\nSince Alex itself is implemented in terms of an Alex scanner,\nbootstrapping
  Alex is a bit tricky:\n\nYou need to have the build-tools `alex` and `happy` manually\ninstalled;
  either via your system package manager distribution, the\nHaskell Platform, or e.g.
  via (run this outside the Git repository!):\n\n    $ cabal install alex happy\n\nwhich
  installs them into `${HOME}/.cabal/bin` by default (make sure\nthey're in your `$PATH`
  for the next steps!).\n\n### Variant A\n\nFirst you need to generate the pre-processed
  templates via\n\n    $ cabal new-run gen-alex-sdist\n\n(otherwise `cabal install`
  will complain about\n\"`data/AlexTemplate: copyFile: does not exist (No such file
  or directory)`\")\n\nAnd then you can install `alex` simply by invoking\n\n    $
  cabal install\n    \nfrom inside the Git folder.\n\n### Variant B\n\nAlternatively,
  you can use the `Makefile` which automates the steps of\nproducing a self-contained
  pre-bootstrapped source distribution with\npre-generated lexer/scanners (and which
  also performs the `cabal\nnew-run gen-alex-sdist` pre-preprocessing step):\n\n    $
  make sdist\n    $ cabal install dist/alex-*.tar.gz\n\nFor convenience, there's also
  a `make sdist-test` target which builds the\nsource source tarball and runs the
  test-suite from within the source dist.\n\n## Contributing & Reporting Issues\n\nPlease
