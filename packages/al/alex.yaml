synopsis: Alex is a tool for generating lexical analysers in Haskell
changelog: ! "## Changes in 3.2.1:\n\n * Fix build problem with GHC; add new test
  tokens_scan_user.x\n\n## Changes in 3.2.0:\n\n * Allow the token type and productions
  to be overloaded, and add new\n   directives: %token, %typeclass, %action.  See
  \"Type Signatures and\n   Typeclasses\" in the manual.\n * Some small space leak
  fixes\n\n##  Changes in 3.1.7:\n\n * Add support for `%encoding` directive\n   (allows
  to control `--latin1` from inside Alex scripts)\n * Make code forward-compatible
  with in-progress proposals\n * Suppress more warnings\n\n##  Changes in 3.1.6:\n\n
  * `sdist` for 3.1.5 was mis-generated, causing it to ask for Happy\n    when building.\n\n##
  Changes in 3.1.5:\n\n * Generate less warning-laden code, and suppress other warnings.\n
  * Bug fixes.\n\n##  Changes in 3.1.4:\n\n * Add Applicative/Functor instances for
  GHC 7.10\n\n##  Changes in 3.1.3:\n\n * Fix for clang (XCode 5)\n\n##  Changes in
  3.1.2:\n\n * Add missing file to extra-source-files\n\n##  Changes in 3.1.1:\n\n
  * Bug fixes (#24, #30, #31, #32)\n\n##  Changes in 3.1.0:\n\n * necessary changes
  to work with GHC 7.8.1\n\n##  Changes in 3.0 (since 2.3.5)\n\n * Unicode support
  (contributed mostly by Jean-Philippe Bernardy,\n   with help from Alan Zimmerman).\n\n
  \  * An Alex lexer now takes a UTF-8 encoded byte sequence as input\n     (see Section
  5.1, “Unicode and UTF-8”. If you are using the\n     \"basic\" wrapper or one of
  the other wrappers that takes a\n     Haskell String as input, the string is automatically
  encoded\n     into UTF-8 by Alex. If your input is a ByteString, you are\n     responsible
  for ensuring that the input is UTF-8 encoded. The\n     old 8-bit behaviour is still
  available via the --latin1\n     option.\n\n   * Alex source files are assumed to
  be in UTF-8, like Haskell\n     source files. The lexer specification can use Unicode\n
  \    characters and ranges.\n\n   * `alexGetChar` is renamed to `alexGetByte` in
  the generated code.\n\n   * There is a new option, `--latin1`, that restores the
  old\n     behaviour.\n\n * Alex now does DFA minimization, which helps to reduce
  the size\n   of the generated tables, especially for lexers that use Unicode.\n"

description: ! "# Alex: A Lexical Analyser Generator\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/simonmar/alex.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/simonmar/alex)\n\nAlex
  is a Lex-like tool for generating Haskell scanners.  For complete\ndocumentation,
  see the doc directory.\n\n   http://www.haskell.org/alex/\n\n   http://hackage.haskell.org/package/alex\n\nAlex
  is built using Cabal.  First install GHC and cabal-install, then:\n\n    $ cabal
  configure\n    $ cabal build\n    $ cabal install\n\nAlex version 2.0 has changed
  fairly considerably since version 1.x,\nand the syntax is almost completely different.
  \ For a detailed list of\nchanges, see the release notes in the documentation.\n\nAlex
  is now covered by a BSD-Style licence; see the licence file in\nthe 'doc' directory
  for details.\n\nThe sources are in the 'src' directory and the documentation in
  the 'doc'\ndirectory; various  examples are in the 'examples' subdirectory.\n\nThe
  source code in the 'src' and 'examples' directories is intended\nfor a Haskell 98
  compiler with hierarchical modules.  It should work\nwith GHC >= 5.04.\n\nPlease
  report any bugs or comments at  https://github.com/simonmar/alex/issues\n\nShare
  and enjoy,\n\nChris Dornan:  cdornan@arm.com\n\nIsaac Jones:   ijones@syntaxpolice.org\n\nSimon
