synopsis: Alex is a tool for generating lexical analysers in Haskell
changelog: ! "## Changes in 3.2.4:\n\n * Remove dependency on QuickCheck\n * Change
  the way that bootstrapping is done: see README.md for build\n   instructions\n\n##
  Changes in 3.2.3:\n\n * fix issue when using cpphs (#116)\n\n## Changes in 3.2.2:\n\n
  * Manage line length in generated files [GH-84]\n * Fix issue when identifier with
  multiple single quotes, e.g. `foo''` was used\n * Allow omitting spaces around `=`
  in macro definitions\n * Include pre-generated Parser.hs and Scan.hs in the Hackage
  upload, to\n   make bootstrapping easier.\n\n## Changes in 3.2.1:\n\n * Fix build
  problem with GHC; add new test tokens_scan_user.x\n\n## Changes in 3.2.0:\n\n *
  Allow the token type and productions to be overloaded, and add new\n   directives:
  %token, %typeclass, %action.  See \"Type Signatures and\n   Typeclasses\" in the
  manual.\n * Some small space leak fixes\n\n##  Changes in 3.1.7:\n\n * Add support
  for `%encoding` directive\n   (allows to control `--latin1` from inside Alex scripts)\n
  * Make code forward-compatible with in-progress proposals\n * Suppress more warnings\n\n##
  \ Changes in 3.1.6:\n\n * `sdist` for 3.1.5 was mis-generated, causing it to ask
  for Happy\n    when building.\n\n## Changes in 3.1.5:\n\n * Generate less warning-laden
  code, and suppress other warnings.\n * Bug fixes.\n\n##  Changes in 3.1.4:\n\n *
  Add Applicative/Functor instances for GHC 7.10\n\n##  Changes in 3.1.3:\n\n * Fix
  for clang (XCode 5)\n\n##  Changes in 3.1.2:\n\n * Add missing file to extra-source-files\n\n##
  \ Changes in 3.1.1:\n\n * Bug fixes (#24, #30, #31, #32)\n\n##  Changes in 3.1.0:\n\n
  * necessary changes to work with GHC 7.8.1\n\n##  Changes in 3.0 (since 2.3.5)\n\n
  * Unicode support (contributed mostly by Jean-Philippe Bernardy,\n   with help from
  Alan Zimmerman).\n\n   * An Alex lexer now takes a UTF-8 encoded byte sequence as
  input\n     (see Section 5.1, “Unicode and UTF-8”. If you are using the\n     \"basic\"
  wrapper or one of the other wrappers that takes a\n     Haskell String as input,
  the string is automatically encoded\n     into UTF-8 by Alex. If your input is a
  ByteString, you are\n     responsible for ensuring that the input is UTF-8 encoded.
  The\n     old 8-bit behaviour is still available via the --latin1\n     option.\n\n
  \  * Alex source files are assumed to be in UTF-8, like Haskell\n     source files.
  The lexer specification can use Unicode\n     characters and ranges.\n\n   * `alexGetChar`
  is renamed to `alexGetByte` in the generated code.\n\n   * There is a new option,
  `--latin1`, that restores the old\n     behaviour.\n\n * Alex now does DFA minimization,
  which helps to reduce the size\n   of the generated tables, especially for lexers
  that use Unicode.\n"

description: ! "# Alex: A Lexical Analyser Generator\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/simonmar/alex.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/simonmar/alex)\n\nAlex
  is a Lex-like tool for generating Haskell scanners.  For complete\ndocumentation,
  see the doc directory.\n\n- <https://www.haskell.org/alex/>\n\n- <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/alex>\n\nAlex
  version 2.0 has changed fairly considerably since version 1.x,\nand the syntax is
  almost completely different.  For a detailed list of\nchanges, see the release notes
  in the documentation.\n\nAlex is now covered by a BSD-Style licence; see the licence
  file in\nthe 'doc' directory for details.\n\nThe sources are in the 'src' directory
  and the documentation in the 'doc'\ndirectory; various  examples are in the 'examples'
  subdirectory.\n\nThe source code in the 'src' and 'examples' directories is intended\nfor
  a Haskell 98 compiler with hierarchical modules.  It should work\nwith GHC >= 5.04.\n\n##
  Build Instructions\n\nIf you just want to *use* Alex, you can download or install
  (via\n`cabal install alex`) an\n[Alex release from Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/alex);
  also note that\ndistributions such as the\n[Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/)
  and other package\nmanager-based distributions provide packages for Alex. Moreover,\nrecent
  versions of `cabal` will automatically install the required\nversion of `alex` based
  on\n[`build-tools`/`build-tool-depends` declarations](http://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing-packages.html#pkg-field-build-tool-depends).\n\nRead
  on if you want to build Alex directly from Git.\n\nAlex is built using GHC & Cabal;
  so first install\n[GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc) and\n[`cabal-install-2.0`](https://www.haskell.org/cabal)
  (or later).\n\nSince Alex itself is implemented in terms of an Alex scanner,\nbootstrapping
  Alex is a bit tricky:\n\nYou need to have the build-tools `alex` and `happy` manually\ninstalled;
  either via your system package manager distribution, the\nHaskell Platform, or e.g.
  via (run this outside the Git repository!):\n\n    $ cabal install alex happy\n\nwhich
  installs them into `${HOME}/.cabal/bin` by default (make sure\nthey're in your `$PATH`
  for the next steps!).\n\n### Variant A\n\nFirst you need to generate the pre-processed
  templates via\n\n    $ cabal new-run gen-alex-sdist\n\n(otherwise `cabal install`
  will complain about\n\"`data/AlexTemplate: copyFile: does not exist (No such file
  or directory)`\")\n\nAnd then you can install `alex` simply by invoking\n\n    $
  cabal install\n    \nfrom inside the Git folder.\n\n### Variant B\n\nAlternatively,
  you can use the `Makefile` which automates the steps of\nproducing a self-contained
  pre-bootstrapped source distribution with\npre-generated lexer/scanners (and which
  also performs the `cabal\nnew-run gen-alex-sdist` pre-preprocessing step):\n\n    $
  make sdist\n    $ cabal install dist/alex-*.tar.gz\n\nFor convenience, there's also
  a `make sdist-test` target which builds the\nsource source tarball and runs the
  test-suite from within the source dist.\n\n## Contributing & Reporting Issues\n\nPlease
