  # Algebraic graphs

  [![Hackage version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/algebraic-graphs.svg?label=Hackage)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs) [![Build status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/snowleopard/alga/ci/master.svg)](https://github.com/snowleopard/alga/actions)

  **Alga** is a library for algebraic construction and manipulation of graphs in Haskell. See
  [this Haskell Symposium paper](https://github.com/snowleopard/alga-paper) and the
  corresponding [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdQGLewU-8k) for the motivation
  behind the library, the underlying theory and implementation details. There is also a
  [Haskell eXchange talk](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/10635-algebraic-graphs),
  and a [tutorial](https://nobrakal.github.io/alga-tutorial) by Alexandre Moine.

  ## Main idea

  Consider the following data type, which is defined in the top-level module
  [Algebra.Graph](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph.html)
  of the library:

  ```haskell
  data Graph a = Empty | Vertex a | Overlay (Graph a) (Graph a) | Connect (Graph a) (Graph a)
  ```

  We can give the following semantics to the constructors in terms of the pair **(V, E)** of graph *vertices* and *edges*:

  * `Empty` constructs the empty graph **(∅, ∅)**.
  * `Vertex x` constructs a graph containing a single vertex, i.e. **({x}, ∅)**.
  * `Overlay x y` overlays graphs **(Vx, Ex)** and **(Vy, Ey)** constructing **(Vx ∪ Vy, Ex ∪ Ey)**.
  * `Connect x y` connects graphs **(Vx, Ex)** and **(Vy, Ey)** constructing **(Vx ∪ Vy, Ex ∪ Ey ∪ Vx × Vy)**.

  Alternatively, we can give an algebraic semantics to the above graph construction primitives by defining the following
  type class and specifying a set of laws for its instances (see module [Algebra.Graph.Class](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-Class.html)):

  ```haskell
  class Graph g where
      type Vertex g
      empty   :: g
      vertex  :: Vertex g -> g
      overlay :: g -> g -> g
      connect :: g -> g -> g
  ```

  The laws of the type class are remarkably similar to those of a [semiring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiring),
  so we use `+` and `*` as convenient shortcuts for `overlay` and `connect`, respectively:

  * (`+`, `empty`) is an idempotent commutative monoid.
  * (`*`, `empty`) is a monoid.
  * `*` distributes over `+`, that is: `x * (y + z) == x * y + x * z` and `(x + y) * z == x * z + y * z`.
  * `*` can be decomposed: `x * y * z == x * y + x * z + y * z`.

  This algebraic structure corresponds to *unlabelled directed graphs*: every expression represents a graph, and every
  graph can be represented by an expression. Other types of graphs (e.g. undirected) can be obtained by modifying the
  above set of laws. Algebraic graphs provide a convenient, safe and powerful interface for working with graphs in Haskell,
  and allow the application of equational reasoning for proving the correctness of graph algorithms.

  To represent *non-empty graphs*, we can drop the `Empty` constructor -- see module
  [Algebra.Graph.NonEmpty](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-NonEmpty.html).

  To represent *edge-labelled graphs*, we can switch to the following data type, as
  explained in my [Haskell eXchange 2018 talk](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/12361-labelled-algebraic-graphs):

  ```haskell
  data Graph e a = Empty
                 | Vertex a
                 | Connect e (Graph e a) (Graph e a)
  ```

  Here `e` is the type of edge labels. If `e` is a monoid `(<+>, zero)` then graph overlay can be recovered
  as `Connect zero`, and `<+>` corresponds to *parallel composition* of edge labels.

  ## How fast is the library?

  Alga can handle graphs comprising millions of vertices and billions of edges in a matter of seconds, which is fast
  enough for many applications. We believe there is a lot of potential for improving the performance of the library, and
  this is one of our top priorities. If you come across a performance issue when using the library, please let us know.

  Some preliminary benchmarks can be found [here](https://github.com/haskell-perf/graphs).

  ## Blog posts

  The development of the library has been documented in the series of blog posts:
