description: "# Algebraic graphs\n\n[![Hackage version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/algebraic-graphs.svg?label=Hackage)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs)
  [![Linux & OS X status](https://img.shields.io/travis/snowleopard/alga/master.svg?label=Linux%20%26%20OS%20X)](https://travis-ci.org/snowleopard/alga)
  [![Windows status](https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/snowleopard/alga/master.svg?label=Windows)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/snowleopard/alga)\n\n**Alga**
  is a library for algebraic construction and manipulation of graphs in Haskell. See\n[this
  Haskell Symposium paper](https://github.com/snowleopard/alga-paper) and the\ncorresponding
  [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdQGLewU-8k) for the motivation\nbehind the
  library, the underlying theory and implementation details. There is also a\n[Haskell
  eXchange talk](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/10635-algebraic-graphs), \nand
  a [tutorial](https://nobrakal.github.io/alga-tutorial) by Alexandre Moine.\n\n##
  Main idea\n\nConsider the following data type, which is defined in the top-level
  module\n[Algebra.Graph](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph.html)\nof
  the library:\n\n```haskell\ndata Graph a = Empty | Vertex a | Overlay (Graph a)
  (Graph a) | Connect (Graph a) (Graph a)\n```\n\nWe can give the following semantics
  to the constructors in terms of the pair **(V, E)** of graph *vertices* and *edges*:\n\n*
  `Empty` constructs the empty graph **(∅, ∅)**.\n* `Vertex x` constructs a graph
  containing a single vertex, i.e. **({x}, ∅)**.\n* `Overlay x y` overlays graphs
  **(Vx, Ex)** and **(Vy, Ey)** constructing **(Vx ∪ Vy, Ex ∪ Ey)**.\n* `Connect x
  y` connects graphs **(Vx, Ex)** and **(Vy, Ey)** constructing **(Vx ∪ Vy, Ex ∪ Ey
  ∪ Vx × Vy)**.\n\nAlternatively, we can give an algebraic semantics to the above
  graph construction primitives by defining the following\ntype class and specifying
  a set of laws for its instances (see module [Algebra.Graph.Class](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-Class.html)):\n\n```haskell\nclass
  Graph g where\n    type Vertex g\n    empty   :: g\n    vertex  :: Vertex g -> g\n
  \   overlay :: g -> g -> g\n    connect :: g -> g -> g\n```\n\nThe laws of the type
  class are remarkably similar to those of a [semiring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiring),\nso
  we use `+` and `*` as convenient shortcuts for `overlay` and `connect`, respectively:\n\n*
  (`+`, `empty`) is an idempotent commutative monoid.\n* (`*`, `empty`) is a monoid.\n*
  `*` distributes over `+`, that is: `x * (y + z) == x * y + x * z` and `(x + y) *
  z == x * z + y * z`.\n* `*` can be decomposed: `x * y * z == x * y + x * z + y *
  z`.\n\nThis algebraic structure corresponds to *unlabelled directed graphs*: every
  expression represents a graph, and every\ngraph can be represented by an expression.
  Other types of graphs (e.g. undirected) can be obtained by modifying the\nabove
  set of laws. Algebraic graphs provide a convenient, safe and powerful interface
  for working with graphs in Haskell,\nand allow the application of equational reasoning
  for proving the correctness of graph algorithms.\n\nTo represent *non-empty graphs*,
  we can drop the `Empty` constructor -- see module\n[Algebra.Graph.NonEmpty](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-NonEmpty.html).\n\nTo
  represent *edge-labelled graphs*, we can switch to the following data type, as\nexplained
  in my [Haskell eXchange 2018 talk](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/12361-labelled-algebraic-graphs):\n\n```haskell\ndata
  Graph e a = Empty\n               | Vertex a\n               | Connect e (Graph
  e a) (Graph e a)\n```\n\nHere `e` is the type of edge labels. If `e` is a monoid
  `(<+>, zero)` then graph overlay can be recovered\nas `Connect zero`, and `<+>`
  corresponds to *parallel composition* of edge labels.\n\n## How fast is the library?\n\nAlga
  can handle graphs comprising millions of vertices and billions of edges in a matter
  of seconds, which is fast\nenough for many applications. We believe there is a lot
  of potential for improving the performance of the library, and\nthis is one of our
  top priorities. If you come across a performance issue when using the library, please
  let us know.\n\nSome preliminary benchmarks can be found [here](https://github.com/haskell-perf/graphs).\n\n##
