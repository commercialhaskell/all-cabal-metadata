  # Revision history for alpaca-netcode

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- YYYY-mm-dd

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.
changelog-type: markdown
description: |-
  A rollback/replay client-server system for realtime multiplayer games. The API
  only requires you to express your game as a pure, deterministic function.

  See "Alpaca.NetCode" to get started.

  === Advantages
  * Simple code. Your game logic contains no NetCode.
  * Low bandwidth. Only inputs are shared.
  * Zero latency. Player's own inputs affect their game immediatly.
  * UDP based. Unordered and using redundancy to mitigate packet loss.
  * Lightweight server. The server does not run the game logic, it only relays and tracks user inputs.
  * Cheating. Only inputs are shared which eliminates a whole class state manipulation cheats.

  === Disadvantages
  * Increased CPU usage. Rollback/replay means that clients must run the game step function multiple times per frame.
  * Not suitable for large numbers of players. Tens of players is likey reasonable.

  === Disclaimer
  This is an initial release with minimal functionality and still very
  experimental. Use at your own risk.
