  This library parses the TEI-encoded Shakespeare plays published by the Folger
  Shakespeare Library. It also demonstrates different use cases for stage data by
  providing some example applications.

  You can download individual plays [here][downloads] and the complete set
  [here][download-all].

  [downloads]: http://www.folgerdigitaltexts.org/download/
  [download-all]: http://www.folgerdigitaltexts.org/download/xml/FolgerDigitalTexts_XML_Complete.zip

  The toolset can be installed using cabal or stack:

      cabal install folgerhs
      stack install folgerhs

  Once installed, it can be used as a library (documentation needs yet to be
  written) or as an application.

  ## Stage animation

  The current speaker is surrounded by a white border, arrows going up represent
  characters leaving the stage, arrows going down represent characters entering
  it. The animation can be stopped using the `space` bar, you can advance it by
  using the `right` arrow and rewind it using the `left` one.

      $ folgerhs animate TN.xml

  ## Per-line character presence

  With characters as columns and lines as rows, a line-by-line breakdown of
  speakers and characters on stage.
