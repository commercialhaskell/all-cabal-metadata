description: ! '# forest-fire


  This is a little command-line tool with an ill-advised name, to easily

  tear down CloudFormation stacks which have outputs that other stacks

  depend on.  In the AWS Console this is rather annoying, since you have

  to manually chase up dependencies.


  This tool simply interrogates the `aws-cli` tool about the stack

  you''re trying to delete, finds out its outputs, and checks whether any

  currently-active stacks are importing them.  The output is a

  dependency tree, which trivially tells us the order of deletion for it

  to succeed.  If you''re feeling adventurous, you may also let

  `forest-fire` do the actual deletion for you.


  # Installation


  ## Prerequisites


  You''ll need the following installed and available to be able to use

  this software:


  * Haskell Stack

  * AWS CLI interface


  ## Instructions


  tba


  # Usage


  If you simply run the tool without arguments, it''ll print usage

  information.  Here''s the down-low, however.


  ## Find out what depends on a stack


  ```sh

  stack exec forest-fire -- "kubernetes-dynamic-91acf0ef-lifecycle"

  ```


  ## Perform the deletions if you''re satisfied with the tree


  ```sh

  stack exec forest-fire -- "kubernetes-dynamic-91acf0ef-lifecycle" --delete

  ```

  Thanks Redbubble, i totally should''ve been doing other things instead

  of shaving this yak.
