  A `FocusList` is a sequence of elements which has one element as its `Focus`. It
  supports quick insertion and indexing by its implementation with
  [`Seq`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-0.6.0.1/docs/Data-Sequence.html#t:Seq).

  The fcuslist package is similar to [pointed-list](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pointedlist-0.6.1) or [list-zipper](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ListZipper). Focuslist however is optimised for fast indexing and insertion at any point, and can be empty. For operations where linked lists perform better the other packages are likely to be superior, though for other operations focuslist is likely to be faster.

  ## Example

  Here is a short example of using `FocusList`.

  ```haskell
  module Main where

  import Data.FocusList
    ( Focus(Focus), FocusList, appendFL, fromListFL, getFocusItemFL, prependFL
    , singletonFL
    )
  import Data.Foldable (toList)

  -- | Create a new 'FocusList' from a list.  You must set the 'Focus' of the new
  -- 'FocusList'.  The 'Focus' is counting from zero, so the @goat@ element should
  -- have the 'Focus'.
  --
  -- If you try to specify a 'Focus' out of range from the input list,
  -- 'fromListFL' will return 'Nothing'.
  myFocusList :: Maybe (FocusList String)
  myFocusList = fromListFL (Focus 2) ["hello", "bye", "goat", "dog"]

  -- | You can get the focused element from an existing 'FocusList'
  --
  -- If the 'FocusList' is empty, this returns 'Nothing'.
  myFocusElement :: FocusList String -> Maybe String
  myFocusElement focuslist = getFocusItemFL focuslist

  -- | You can append to either side of a 'FocusList'.
  --
  -- 'singletonFL' creates a 'FocusList' with a single element.
  -- That single element will have the 'Focus'.
  --
  -- 'myFocusListAppended' will have a value of
  -- @FocusList (Focus 1) ["bye", "hello", "foobar"]@
  myFocusListAppended :: FocusList String
  myFocusListAppended =
    prependFL "bye" (appendFL (singletonFL "hello") "foobar")

  -- | 'FocusList' is an instance of 'Functor' and 'Foldable', so you can use
  -- functions like 'fmap' and 'toList' on a 'FocusList'.
  fmapAndConvertToList :: FocusList Int -> [String]
  fmapAndConvertToList focuslist = toList (fmap show focuslist)

  main :: IO ()
  main = do
    putStrLn "myFocusList:"
    print myFocusList

    putStrLn "\nmyFocusListAppended:"
    print myFocusListAppended

    putStrLn "\nmyFocusElement myFocusListAppended:"
    print (myFocusElement myFocusListAppended)

    putStrLn "\nfmap length myFocusListAppended:"
    print (fmap length myFocusListAppended)

    putStrLn "\nfmapAndConvertToList (fmap length myFocusListAppended):"
    print (fmapAndConvertToList (fmap length myFocusListAppended))
  ```
