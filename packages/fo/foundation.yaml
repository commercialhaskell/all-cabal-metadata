description: |-
  A custom prelude with no dependencies apart from base.

  This package has the following goals:

  * provide a base like sets of modules that provide a consistent set of features and bugfixes across multiple versions of GHC (unlike base).

  * provide a better and more efficient prelude than base's prelude.

  * be self-sufficient: no external dependencies apart from base.

  * provide better data-types: packed unicode string by default, arrays.

  * Better numerical classes that better represent mathematical thing (No more all-in-one Num).

  * Better I/O system with less Lazy IO

  * Usual partial functions distinguished through type system
