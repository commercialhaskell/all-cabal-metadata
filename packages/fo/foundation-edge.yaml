  Foundation-edge
  ===============

  This package is useful to convert to and from, types and data structure commonly found in
  the haskell ecosystem.

  For now, edge support the following packages:

  * bytestring (initial)
  * text (initial)

  And planning to add support to:

  * vector

  If you think edge would benefits from other packages, open an issue (or even better a PR) with
  suggestion of what to add.
