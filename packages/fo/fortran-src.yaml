      (#257, @RaoulHC)
    * refactor Fortran type & value representation & expression evaluator without

  ### 0.12.0 (Oct 19, 2022)
    * clean up F77 include inlining (#245, @RaoulHC)
      * directly export F77 include parser at `f77lIncludesNoTransform`
      * `f77lIncIncludes :: String -> ByteString -> IO [Block A0]` should now be
        defined by the user e.g. `\fn bs -> throwIOLeft $ f77lIncludesNoTransform
        fn bs`
    * `Language.Fortran.Analysis.SemanticTypes`: alter `SemType` constructor
      `TArray` to support assumed-size (e.g. `integer arr(*)`) arrays (#244)
    * `Language.Fortran.Rewriter`: fix inline comment padding (#242, @RaoulHC)

  ### 0.11.0 (Oct 10, 2022)
    * add strong Fortran value & type representation at `Language.Fortran.Repr`
      (currently unused) (#235, @raehik)
      * operations are accurate to actual Fortran compiler behaviour e.g. integers
        are stored fixed-width based on kind, so overflow behaviour is free
      * can recover a value's precise type (e.g. `INTEGER(8)`, including kind) via
        pattern matching
    * bump minimum compiler version to GHC 9.0
    * improved comment handling in fixed form lexer: parse more comment syntax,
      case sensitive, parse beyond column 72 (#237, @RaoulHC)
    * allow `ExpDataRef` constructor in `varName` (fixes a crash in type analysis
      #238)
    * add `Annotated`, `Spanned` instances for intermediate AST data type
      `ArgumentExpression`
    * export statement-level "pre-prepared" parsers (previously, you would have to
      define the parser yourself using parser utils and the Happy parser export)
    * export `Language.Fortran.Parser.byVerFromFilename :: Parser (ProgramFile
      A0)`, a replacement for the removed
      `Language.Fortran.Parser.Any.fortranParser`

  ### 0.10.2 (Aug 18, 2022)
    * fix missing parentheses when pretty printing certain syntax #233
    * fix missing export of `ParseErrorSimple` in `Parser`
    * fix inlined includes block order #234

  ### 0.10.1 (Aug 1, 2022)
    * export `ParseErrorSimple` from `Parser`, not internal module `Parser.Monad`
    * rewriter fixes #232

  ### 0.10.0 (Jul 13, 2022)
    * Fix parsing kind parameters like `a_1` on literals. Previously, that would
      be parsed as a kind parameter on a kind parameter. Now we don't do that,
      following gfortran's behaviour.
      * Kind parameter representation is changed to explicitly say if it's an
        integer kind or named constant kind, rather than reusing `Expression`.
    * BOZ literals
      * add some syntactic info (to enable checking standards conformance)
      * export `bozAsTwosComp` function for reading as two's complement integer
    * allow named constants in complex literals
    * document `FirstParameter`, `SecondParameter` behaviour/safety, fix erroneous
      instances
    * fiddle with record selectors for some AST nodes (for better Aeson instances)
    * pair IF/CASE conditions with their blocks, rather than splitting between two
      lists
    * `ExpFunctionCall` and `StCall` store procedure arguments in `AList` (`[a]`)
      instead of `Maybe AList` (`Maybe [a]`)
      * Matching is safer because empty lists are always `[]` instead of `Nothing`
        or `Just []`. Construction for empty lists is more awkward.
      * A better solution would be to use an `AList`-like that also stores extra
        syntactic information.
    * refactored a number of small AST nodes
      * `ImpElement`
      * `ForallHeader`
    * add Hackage documentation to many individual AST constructors and fields
    * improve include parser interface #227
    * improve newline handling for block parsers #228
    * fix some source span misses #225

  ### 0.9.0 (Feb 14, 2022)
    * Restructure parsing-related modules for code deduplication and better user
      experience.
      * Now all user-facing parsers and the combinators to create them are in a
        single module at `Language.Fortran.Parser`.
      * The Happy parsers have fewer dependencies, so should no longer require a
        recompile due to apparently unrelated changes.
    * Remove some deprecated shims (from the restructured modules).
    * Merge fortran-src-extras `Language.Fortran.Extras.ModFiles.Extras` module
      into `Language.Fortran.Util.ModFile`.

  ### 0.8.0 (Jan 04, 2022)
    * Merge declarator constructors. Now you differentiate between array and
      scalar declarators by looking at the relevant field. See
      `Language.Fortran.AST.Declarator` for details.
    * Add `bozAsNatural :: Num a => Boz -> a` function to resolve BOZ constants as
      integers

  ### 0.7.0 (Dec 09, 2021)
    * No longer treat `!` in strings as comments in continuation reformatter
      (thanks @envp) #179
    * CI builds on Mac; more release automation #181 #189
    * Handle nonstandard kind parameter in parsing & type analysis #188
    * Fix renamer ambiguity resulting in unusual name-related breakages (e.g.
      `ValVariable` not getting transformed to `ValIntrinsic`) #190
    * Fully parse logical literals early (don't leave as `String`) #185
      * Code that touches `ValLogical` will have to be updated -- it should mean
        removal of user-side parsing.
    * Explicitly parse integer literal kind parameter #191
      * The `String` representation stored should now always be safe to `read` to
        a Haskell `Integral`.
    * Provide real literals in a semi-parsed "decomposed" format #193
      * Kind parameters are also made explicit.
      * Libraries with custom real literal parsing should be able to replace it
        with `readRealLit :: (Fractional a, Read a) => RealLit -> a`.
    * BOZ literal constants receive their own `Value` constructor (instead of
      sharing one with integers) #194
      * Also parse them to an intermediate data type and provide handling
        functions.

  Note that kind parameters are disabled in fixed form parsers (F77, F66), so for
  codebases targeting older standards, many changes will be along the lines of
  `ValInteger x` -> `ValInteger x _`.

  ### 0.6.1 (Sep 17, 2021)
    * Properly include test data in package dist (in preparation for placing on
      Stackage)

  ### 0.6.0 (Sep 03, 2021)
    * IF and CASE block constructs are now parsed as blocks at parsing instead of
      as a post-parse transformation (no intermediate statement representation)
      #154
    * add ASSOCIATE block construct (Fortran 2003 parser only) #165
    * `CommonGroup` AST nodes now store `Declarator`s instead of `Expression`s
      #173
      * various bug fixes related to their typing as a result
    * CI now building on Windows, and save Linux & Windows executables for each
      build
    * various bugfixes (#34, #155)

  ### 0.5.0 (Jun 30, 2021)
    * Introduce a second-stage type representation including kind info alongside
      types, and resolving some types to semantic type with preset kinds (e.g.
      `DOUBLE PRECISION` -> `REAL(8)`).
      * Module is at Language.Fortran.Analysis.SemanticTypes . Includes utils and
        instances.
      * The type analysis in Language.Fortran.Analysis.Types uses this
        representation now (`IDType` stores a `SemType` instead of a `BaseType`).
    * Move `CharacterLen` from parsing to type analysis.
      * This makes `BaseType` now a plain tag/enum with no extra info.
    * Add extended Fortran 90 real literal parser (parses kind info).
    * Export some infer monad utils (potentially useful for running just parts of
      type analysis)
    * Parser & lexer tweaks
      * Fortran 77 parser should no longer attempt to parse kind selectors for
        `DOUBLE` types
      * Fix an edge case with the fixed form lexer (#150)

  ### 0.4.3 (May 25, 2021)

    * Add Haddock documentation to AST module. Many parts of the AST now have
      commentary on meaning and usage, and the Haddock page is sectioned.
    * Add STATIC statement (should be similar/identical to SAVE attribute) to
      fixed-form lexer, support in Fortran 77 Extended parser.
    * Rewrite post-parse transformation handling. Parser modules now export more
      parsers which allow you to select post-parse transformations to apply,
      intended to enable quicker parsing if you know you don't need to certain
      transformations.
    * Support percent data references in fixed-form lexer, enable in Fortran 77
      parser
    * Now also testing on GHC 9.0
    * Cache INCLUDE-ed files to avoid unnecessary re-parsing

  ### 0.4.2 (March 03, 2021)

    * `FortranVersion` from `ParserMonad` moved to its own module
      `Language.Fortran.Version`. `ParserMonad` will re-export it for now.
    * `Version.deduceVersion` renamed to `deduceFortranVersion` due to often being
      imported non-qualified. `deduceVersion` remains as an alias.
    * Provide a continuation reformatter in `PrettyPrint`. Runs on `String`s and
      doesn't guarantee the output is a valid program, so not enabled by default.
    * Add a diff-like rewriter, similar to
      [reprinter](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/reprinter) but uses
      replacements rather than an annotated AST.
    * Various internal de-duplication and changes.

  ### 0.4.1

  * Ignore comments in structure declaration PR#107 (thanks Jason Xu)

  ### 0.4.0 (August 29, 2019)

  * ModGraph: parse Fortran files and assemble them into a dependency graph in order to construct automated 'build' plans for analysis and summarisation (e.g. with --make-mods option).
  * Change name of compilation to summarisation. Remains as '-c' option.
  * Allow multiple files and directories to be specified on command line.
  * Search includedir recursively for fsmod files.
  * Change format of fsmod-files so that they can contain [ModFile] since multiple Fortran files can be summarised into a single mod file.
  * Introduce strictness and NFData dependencies across the board.
  * Use Pipes to process large amounts of files in order to control memory usage and more efficiently process things.
  * Parsing rules for StructStructures (thanks Raoul Charman)

  ### 0.3.0 (June 13, 2019)

  * Add partial Fortran2003 support.
  * Introduce datatype for BBGr instead of prior type alias for Gr.
    * Now split into three fields: bbgrGr, bbgrEntries and bbgrExits
    * May require refactoring of code to use bbgrGr field where a Gr was expected before.
  * Introduce pragmaOffset field for Position, allowing pragmas to specify an apparent file and line-number.
    * May require refactoring of code that uses the Position constructor.
    * Fifth field is Maybe (Int, String), containing a line-offset and a target filename when present.
    * It's designed such that most Position-based transformations are not affected by the pragmaOffset.
    * They may need to preserve the field, though, as it passes through functions.
    * Default value is 'Nothing'.
  * Add --show-flows-to/--show-flows-from features
    * Visualise the dataflow use/def chains using GraphViz.
  * Add --show-block-numbers feature.
    * Allows user to get AST-block numbers easily in order to use them with the above visualisation features.
  * Fix several bugs with dataflow analysis that had accumulated.
  * Eliminate StContinue and StEnddo are eliminated during GroupLabeledDo transformations.
    * To be consistent with unlabeled Do.
  * Parse and discard C-comments as a convenience feature for when fortran-src must interact with the output of C preprocessors that insert spurious comments.
  * Add type propagation into type analysis, annotating every expression with a type.
    * Additional interface: analyseTypesWithEnv to access a list of type errors found.
  * Add dimensional information to CTArray and length/kind to TypeCharacter.
  * Stricter checking of the grouping transform - if any statements that should be grouped are not grouped, raise an error.
  * Support pragmas that alter the current 'filename and position' tracker, often used by preprocessors to help pinpoint original code locations.
    * Uses a relative offset field called 'posPragmaOffset' so that relative measures continue to function correctly.
  * Add constant propagation / parameter variable analysis.
  * Add -c feature to compile 'fsmod files' with renaming and type info.

  ### 0.2.1.1 (May 18, 2018)

  * Extend Fortran 95 support
  * Extend support for legacy extensions

  ### 0.2.1.1 (December 13, 2017)

  * Fortran95Experimental module renamed to Fortran95
  * No infinite loops due to symlinks.
  * Fortran 95 support.
    * AST extended to support more non-standard statements internally.

description: "# fortran-src\n![CI status badge](https://github.com/camfort/fortran-src/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)\n[![DOI](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.07571/status.svg)](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.07571)\n\n\nfortran-src
  is an open-source Haskell library and command-line application for the lexing, parsing,
  and static analysis of Fortran source code. It provides an interface to build other
  tools, e.g., for static analysis, automated refactoring, verification, and compilation.
  The following\nFortran standards are covered:\n\n  * FORTRAN 66 (ANSI X3.9-1966)\n
  \ * FORTRAN 77 (ANSI X3.9-1978 / ISO 1539:1980)\n  * Fortran 90 (ISO/IEC 1539:1991)\n
  \ * Fortran 95 (ISO/IEC 1539-1:1997\n  * Fortran 2003 (partial)\n\nParsing is configurable,
  and you can select the Fortran standard to target,\nincluding special extended modes
  for nonstandard FORTRAN 77.\n\nVarious static analyses are provided including:\n\n*
  Control-flow analysis (building a super graph) (Language.Fortran.Analysis.BBlocks);\n*
  General data flow analyses (Language.Fortran.Analysis.DataFlow), including:\n* Reaching
  definitions;\n* Def-use/use-def;\n* Constant evaluation;\n* Constant propagation;\n*
  Live variable analysis;\n* Induction variable analysis.\n* Type analysis (Language.Fortran.Analysis.Types);\n*
  Module graph analysis (Language.Fortran.Analysis.ModGraph);\n\nThis package primarily
  exports a Haskell library, but also builds an executable\nthat can be used for testing
  and debugging. \n\nThe library is the basis of the [CamFort verification tool](https://github.com/camfort/camfort).\n\n##
  Statement of Need\n\nFortran remains a popular language in the international scientific
  community. It is not only a mainstay of legacy software, but is also used to write
  new software. Fortran is particularly notable for its prevalence in earth sciences,
  e.g., for implementing climate models that inform international policy decisions.
  In 2024, Fortran re-entered the Top 10 programming languages in the TIOBE Index,
  showing its enduring popularity. The continued use of Fortran, particularly in scientific
  contexts, was the catalyst for this software package. A challenge in writing language
  tools for Fortran is its long history. There have been several major language standards
  (FORTRAN I-IV, FORTRAN 66 and 77, Fortran 90, 95, 2003, 2008, etc.) Newer standards
  often deprecate features that are known to be a ready source of errors, or difficult
  to specify or understand. However, compilers often support an amalgam of features
  across standards, enabling developers to use deprecated features and mix language
  standards. This complicates the development of new tools for manipulating Fortran
  source code; one must tame the weight of decades of language evolution.\n\nOur package,
  `fortran-src`, provides an open-source unified core for statically analysing Fortran
  code across language standards, with a focus on legacy code over cutting-edge modern
  Fortran. It is both a standalone tool and a library, providing a suite of standard
  static analyses as a basis for further programming language tools and systems.\n\n##
  Obtaining\nWe provide [prebuilt binaries](https://github.com/camfort/fortran-src/releases)\nfor
  Windows, Mac and Linux.\n\n## Usage\nAdd `fortran-src` as a dependency in your Haskell
  project. We're on\n[Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fortran-src) and
  also on\n[Stackage](https://www.stackage.org/package/fortran-src).\n\n### Command-line
  tool\nYou can also invoke `fortran-src` on the command line.\n\nFor features that
  output graphs, the intended usage is to pipe it into the\ncommand `dot -Tpdf` and
  redirect that into a PDF file. The `dot` command is part\nof the [GraphViz project](https://www.graphviz.org/),
  please see their manual\nfor the many other options that can be explored for visualisation
  purposes.\n\n```\nUsage: fortran-src [OPTION...] <file>\n                          --version

  \                         --show-flows-from=AST-BLOCK-ID   dump a graph showing

  you do not pass a `--fortranVersion` flag, the version will be guessed from\nthe
  file name:\n\n  * Files ending in `*.f` are parsed with extended FORTRAN 77 syntax.\n
  \ * Files ending in `*.f90` are parsed with Fortran 90 syntax (and respectively\n
  \   for `*.f2003`/`*.f03`, `*.f2008`/`*.f08`).\n  * Unknown extensions are parsed
  like `*.f` files.\n\n## Building\nYou will need the GMP library plus header files:
  on many platforms, this will be\nvia the package `libgmp-dev`.\n\nHaskell library
  dependencies are listed in `package.yaml`. fortran-src supports\nbuilding with Stack
  or Cabal.\n\nfortran-src supports **GHC 9.0 through GHC 9.4**. We regularly test
  at least the\nminimum and maximum supported GHCs. Releases prior to/newer than those
  may have\nissues. We welcome fixes that would let us support a wider range of compilers.\n\nYou
  will likely need **at least 3 GiBs of memory** to build fortran-src.\n\nFor installing
  GHC and build tools, we strongly recommend\n[ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/).\n\nWhen
  **latest recommended** is used, it means the latest version of the tool\nthat ghcup
  tags with `recommended`. This sometimes lags behind the\n`latest`-tagged version.
  With ghcup installed, run `ghcup list` for a better\nunderstanding.\n\nFollowing
  are general guides for any OS that provides the relevant tools. If you\nhave trouble,
  consider checking the CI workflow files in `.github/workflows`.\n\n### Stack\nWe
  support the latest recommended version of Stack (as of 2021-09-17, Stack\n2.7).
  Generally, any Stack 2.x should work.  *(Stack 1.x may work with minor\nalternations
  -- you may have to download the resolver manually.)*\n\n```\nstack build\n```\n\nFor
  an interactive shell:\n\n```\nstack build\nstack ghci\n```\n\nNote that running
  `stack ghci` before running `stack build` won't work properly,\ndue to `stack ghci`
  not running build tools like Alex and Happy. So parser\nmodules will not be built,
  and you'll receive an error after building the other\nmodules. You can cheat a bit
  and run `stack build` until you see `Building\nlibrary for [...]` (= preprocessing
  has finished), then hit `<Ctrl-C>` to stop\nthe build and run `stack ghci` as usual.\n\n###
  Cabal\nWe support the latest recommended version of Cabal (as of 2021-09-17, Cabal
  3.4)\n\n```\ncabal build\n```\n\nYou can leverage cabal to initialize a ghci session,
  and call the main function like such:\n\n```shell\ncabal repl\n\n:load app/Main.hs\n\n:main
  --version\n```\n\n### Testing\nUnit tests are stored in `test`. Run with `stack
  test` or `cabal test`.\n\n## Usage\n### As a dependency\nfortran-src is available
  on Hackage and Stackage, so for Cabal or Stack projects\nyou should only need to
  add `fortran-src` to your project dependencies.\n\nIf you need a specific version
  of fortran-src in a Stack setup, you can stuff a\nHackage reference into `stack.yaml`
  using `extra-deps`, like:\n\n```yaml\nresolver: ...\n...\n\nextra-deps:\n- ...\n-
  fortran-src-$VERSION\n```\n\n### As a CLI tool\nIf you have Cabal properly configured,
  you should be able install fortran-src\nfrom Hackage:\n\n```\ncabal install fortran-src\n```\n\nWe
  provide prebuilt binaries for some platforms: see the\n[Releases](https://github.com/camfort/fortran-src/releases)
  tab.\n\nOtherwise, you can build from source and use convenience commands like `cabal\nrun`,
  `stack run`. See [#Building](#building) for details.\n\n## Contributing\nWe welcome
  bug reports, fixes and feature proposals. Add an issue or create a\npull request
  on the GitHub repository.\n\n## Support\nYou may be able to find maintainers on
  the [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/)\nIRC network. Check in #fortran-src and
  #camfort . Otherwise, you could get into\ncontact with one of the team on the [CamFort
  team\npage](https://camfort.github.io/team.html) -- or create an issue describing
  your\nproblem and we'll have a look.\n\n### For maintainers\nSee `doc/maintainers.md`
