synopsis: Parsers and analyses for Fortran standards 66, 77, 90 and 95.
changelog: |
  ### 0.5.0 (Jun 30, 2021)
    * Introduce a second-stage type representation including kind info alongside
      types, and resolving some types to semantic type with preset kinds (e.g.
      `DOUBLE PRECISION` -> `REAL(8)`).
      * Module is at Language.Fortran.Analysis.SemanticTypes . Includes utils and
        instances.
      * The type analysis in Language.Fortran.Analysis.Types uses this
        representation now (`IDType` stores a `SemType` instead of a `BaseType`).
    * Move `CharacterLen` from parsing to type analysis.
      * This makes `BaseType` now a plain tag/enum with no extra info.
    * Add extended Fortran 90 real literal parser (parses kind info).
    * Export some infer monad utils (potentially useful for running just parts of
      type analysis)
    * Parser & lexer tweaks
      * Fortran 77 parser should no longer attempt to parse kind selectors for
        `DOUBLE` types
      * Fix an edge case with the fixed form lexer (#150)

  ### 0.4.3 (May 25, 2021)

    * Add Haddock documentation to AST module. Many parts of the AST now have
      commentary on meaning and usage, and the Haddock page is sectioned.
    * Add STATIC statement (should be similar/identical to SAVE attribute) to
      fixed-form lexer, support in Fortran 77 Extended parser.
    * Rewrite post-parse transformation handling. Parser modules now export more
      parsers which allow you to select post-parse transformations to apply,
      intended to enable quicker parsing if you know you don't need to certain
      transformations.
    * Support percent data references in fixed-form lexer, enable in Fortran 77
      parser
    * Now also testing on GHC 9.0
    * Cache INCLUDE-ed files to avoid unnecessary re-parsing

  ### 0.4.2 (March 03, 2021)

    * `FortranVersion` from `ParserMonad` moved to its own module
      `Language.Fortran.Version`. `ParserMonad` will re-export it for now.
    * `Version.deduceVersion` renamed to `deduceFortranVersion` due to often being
      imported non-qualified. `deduceVersion` remains as an alias.
    * Provide a continuation reformatter in `PrettyPrint`. Runs on `String`s and
      doesn't guarantee the output is a valid program, so not enabled by default.
    * Add a diff-like rewriter, similar to
      [reprinter](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/reprinter) but uses
      replacements rather than an annotated AST.
    * Various internal de-duplication and changes.

  ### 0.4.1

  * Ignore comments in structure declaration PR#107 (thanks Jason Xu)

  ### 0.4.0 (August 29, 2019)

  * ModGraph: parse Fortran files and assemble them into a dependency graph in order to construct automated 'build' plans for analysis and summarisation (e.g. with --make-mods option).
  * Change name of compilation to summarisation. Remains as '-c' option.
  * Allow multiple files and directories to be specified on command line.
  * Search includedir recursively for fsmod files.
  * Change format of fsmod-files so that they can contain [ModFile] since multiple Fortran files can be summarised into a single mod file.
  * Introduce strictness and NFData dependencies across the board.
  * Use Pipes to process large amounts of files in order to control memory usage and more efficiently process things.
  * Parsing rules for StructStructures (thanks Raoul Charman)

  ### 0.3.0 (June 13, 2019)

  * Add partial Fortran2003 support.
  * Introduce datatype for BBGr instead of prior type alias for Gr.
    * Now split into three fields: bbgrGr, bbgrEntries and bbgrExits
    * May require refactoring of code to use bbgrGr field where a Gr was expected before.
  * Introduce pragmaOffset field for Position, allowing pragmas to specify an apparent file and line-number.
    * May require refactoring of code that uses the Position constructor.
    * Fifth field is Maybe (Int, String), containing a line-offset and a target filename when present.
    * It's designed such that most Position-based transformations are not affected by the pragmaOffset.
    * They may need to preserve the field, though, as it passes through functions.
    * Default value is 'Nothing'.
  * Add --show-flows-to/--show-flows-from features
    * Visualise the dataflow use/def chains using GraphViz.
  * Add --show-block-numbers feature.
    * Allows user to get AST-block numbers easily in order to use them with the above visualisation features.
  * Fix several bugs with dataflow analysis that had accumulated.
  * Eliminate StContinue and StEnddo are eliminated during GroupLabeledDo transformations.
    * To be consistent with unlabeled Do.
  * Parse and discard C-comments as a convenience feature for when fortran-src must interact with the output of C preprocessors that insert spurious comments.
  * Add type propagation into type analysis, annotating every expression with a type.
    * Additional interface: analyseTypesWithEnv to access a list of type errors found.
  * Add dimensional information to CTArray and length/kind to TypeCharacter.
  * Stricter checking of the grouping transform - if any statements that should be grouped are not grouped, raise an error.
  * Support pragmas that alter the current 'filename and position' tracker, often used by preprocessors to help pinpoint original code locations.
    * Uses a relative offset field called 'posPragmaOffset' so that relative measures continue to function correctly.
  * Add constant propagation / parameter variable analysis.
  * Add -c feature to compile 'fsmod files' with renaming and type info.

  ### 0.2.1.1 (May 18, 2018)

  * Extend Fortran 95 support
  * Extend support for legacy extensions

  ### 0.2.1.1 (December 13, 2017)

  * Fortran95Experimental module renamed to Fortran95
  * No infinite loops due to symlinks.
  * Fortran 95 support.
    * AST extended to support more non-standard statements internally.

  # fortran-src
  ![CI status badge](https://github.com/camfort/fortran-src/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

  Provides lexing, parsing, and basic analyses of Fortran code covering standards: FORTRAN 66, FORTRAN 77, Fortran 90, Fortran 95 and part of Fortran 2003. Includes data flow and basic block analysis, a renamer, and type analysis. For example usage, see the 'camfort' project (https://github.com/camfort/camfort), which uses fortran-src as its front end.

  For features that output graphs, the intended usage is to pipe it into the command 'dot -Tpdf' and redirect that into a PDF file. The 'dot' command is part of the GraphViz project (https://www.graphviz.org/), please see their manual for the many other options that can be explored for visualisation purposes.

      Usage: fortran-src [OPTION...] <file>
        -v VERSION, -F VERSION  --fortranVersion=VERSION         Fortran version to use, format: Fortran[66/77/77Legacy/77Extended/90]

        -r                      --reprint                        Parse and output using pretty printer
                                --dot                            output graphs in GraphViz DOT format
                                --dump-mod-file                  dump the information contained within mod files
        -I DIR                  --include-dir=DIR                directory to search for precompiled 'mod files'
        -c                      --compile                        compile an .fsmod file from the input
                                --show-block-numbers[=LINE-NUM]  Show the corresponding AST-block identifier number next to every line of code.
                                --show-flows-to=AST-BLOCK-ID     dump a graph showing flows-to information from the given AST-block ID; prefix with 's' for supergraph
                                --show-flows-from=AST-BLOCK-ID   dump a graph showing flows-from information from the given AST-block ID; prefix with 's' for supergraph

  ## Usage/Installation
  fortran-src is available on Hackage. Stackage has a very old version and is
  definitely not what you want, but you can specify a newer Hackage version in
  `stack.yaml`.

  ### As a dependency
  Reference `fortran-src` in your (Stack/Cabal) project dependencies. If you're
  using Stack, you can stuff a Hackage reference into `stack.yaml` using
  `extra-deps`, like:

  ```yaml
  resolver: ...
  ...

  extra-deps:
  - ...
  - fortran-src-$VERSION
  ```

  ### As a CLI tool
  If you have Cabal properly configured, you should be able install fortran-src
  from Hackage:

  ```
  cabal install fortran-src
  ```

  Otherwise, we suggest building from source if you want to use the fortran-src
  CLI tool. See [#Build from source](#build-from-source) for details.

  ## Development
  As of 2021-04-28, fortran-src supports and is regularly tested on **GHC 8.6,
  8.8, 8.10 and 9.0**. Releases prior to/newer than those may have issues. We
  welcome fixes that would let us support a wider range of compilers.

  ### Build from source
  #### Stack
  Stack 2.x is required. *(Stack 1.x may work with minor alternations
  -- you may have to download the resolver manually.)*

  ```
  stack setup
  stack build
  ```
