description: |-
  The folly C++ library from Meta, wrapped in a Cabal package so that
  it can be easily depended on by other packages. Having a Cabal
  package also means that we can version the library, which is useful
  as there are no versioned upstream releases.

  Also included is @fast_float-8.0.0@ because it is a dependency of
  folly and this version is not widely available as a distro package
  yet.
