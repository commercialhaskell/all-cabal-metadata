synopsis: Fold multiple events that happen in a given period of time.
changelog: ! "# Revision history for fold-debounce\n\n## 0.2.0.2  -- 2016-05-22\n\n*
  Confirmed build with `data-default-class-0.1.0` and `base-4.9.0.0`.\n\n\n## 0.2.0.1
  \ -- 2016-05-02\n\n* Loosen dependency on `data-default` to `data-default-class`.\n*
  Supports `time-1.6` and `hspec-2.2.3`.\n* Fix test error in Mac OS X.\n\n\n## 0.2.0.0
  \ -- 2015-06-01\n\n* The debounce period now starts from the time when the first
  input\n  event is sent. Previously it was the time when the first input event\n
  \ is popped from the input queue. That lead to weird behavior when the\n  input
  traffic was too intense.\n\n* Now this module works without -threaded ghc option
  thanks to new\n  dependency on 'stm-delay' package.\n\n* Bumped the major version
  due to the new dependency.\n\n\n## 0.1.0.0  -- 2015-05-22\n\n* First version. Released
  on an unsuspecting world.\n"
