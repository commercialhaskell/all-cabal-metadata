changelog: ! "# Revision history for fold-debounce\n\n## 0.2.0.8  -- 2018-09-23\n\n*
  Confirmed test with `stm-2.5.0.0`.\n\n\n## 0.2.0.7  -- 2018-03-14\n\n* Confirmed
  test with `hspec-2.5.0`.\n  Remove its dependency upper bound, because I think it's
  stable enough.\n\n\n## 0.2.0.6  -- 2017-07-21\n\n* Confirmed test with `time-1.8`.\n*
  Drop version bounds for `hspec`. It's stable.\n\n\n## 0.2.0.5  -- 2017-01-24\n\n*
  Confirmed test with `hspec-2.4.0`.\n\n\n## 0.2.0.4  -- 2016-11-27\n\n* Confirmed
  test with `time-1.7`.\n\n\n## 0.2.0.3  -- 2016-10-09\n\n* Confirmed build with `hspec-2.3.0`.\n\n\n##
  0.2.0.2  -- 2016-05-22\n\n* Confirmed build with `data-default-class-0.1.0` and
  `base-4.9.0.0`.\n\n\n## 0.2.0.1  -- 2016-05-02\n\n* Loosen dependency on `data-default`
  to `data-default-class`.\n* Supports `time-1.6` and `hspec-2.2.3`.\n* Fix test error
  in Mac OS X.\n\n\n## 0.2.0.0  -- 2015-06-01\n\n* The debounce period now starts
  from the time when the first input\n  event is sent. Previously it was the time
  when the first input event\n  is popped from the input queue. That lead to weird
  behavior when the\n  input traffic was too intense.\n\n* Now this module works without
  -threaded ghc option thanks to new\n  dependency on 'stm-delay' package.\n\n* Bumped
  the major version due to the new dependency.\n\n\n## 0.1.0.0  -- 2015-05-22\n\n*
  First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n"
