  * Confirmed test with `ghc-9.4.4` and `time-1.12`.

  ## 0.2.0.10  -- 2022-11-24

  * Confirmed test with `ghc-9.2.5` and `time-1.11`.

  ## 0.2.0.7  -- 2018-03-14

    Remove its dependency upper bound, because I think it's stable enough.


  ## 0.2.0.6  -- 2017-07-21

  * Confirmed test with `time-1.8`.
  * Drop version bounds for `hspec`. It's stable.


  ## 0.2.0.5  -- 2017-01-24

  * Confirmed test with `hspec-2.4.0`.


  ## 0.2.0.4  -- 2016-11-27

  * Confirmed test with `time-1.7`.


  ## 0.2.0.3  -- 2016-10-09

  * Confirmed build with `hspec-2.3.0`.


  ## 0.2.0.2  -- 2016-05-22

  * Confirmed build with `data-default-class-0.1.0` and `base-4.9.0.0`.


  ## 0.2.0.1  -- 2016-05-02

  * Loosen dependency on `data-default` to `data-default-class`.
  * Supports `time-1.6` and `hspec-2.2.3`.
  * Fix test error in Mac OS X.


  ## 0.2.0.0  -- 2015-06-01

  * The debounce period now starts from the time when the first input
    event is sent. Previously it was the time when the first input event
    is popped from the input queue. That lead to weird behavior when the
    input traffic was too intense.

  * Now this module works without -threaded ghc option thanks to new
    dependency on 'stm-delay' package.

  * Bumped the major version due to the new dependency.


  ## 0.1.0.0  -- 2015-05-22

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.
