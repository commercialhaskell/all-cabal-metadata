description: "1. The game has been described in WIKIPEDIA under 'Paper Soccer'. Please
  refer to there in order to learn rules. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Soccer\r\nRules
  of this game can be completed by simply rule. Player who does the move that finishes
  because there is no further available move left, loses only half a point.\r\nSize
  of the court can be defined almost without limits, but as first option size $8 \\times
  8$ has been chosen.\r\n\r\n2. Install Foo\r\n\r\n2.1 Install GHC\r\nFirst install
  Haskell compiler. I've used GHC only. You can find it here: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/.
  Follow installing instructions there. The newest installation contains required
  GLUT and OpenGL Libraries.\r\n\r\n2.2 Compile sources\r\nDownload sources to separate
  directory and compile there using following command \r\nghc --make -package GLUT
  PlayFoo.hs -O -fvia-C -cpp -o PlayFoo \r\nThis works assuming you have direct acess
  to GHC compiler.\r\n"
