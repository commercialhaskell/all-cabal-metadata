description: ! "# `foldl` v1.4.0\n\nUse this `foldl` library when you want to compute
  multiple folds over a\ncollection in one pass over the data without space leaks.\n\nFor
  example, suppose that you want to simultaneously compute the sum of the list\nand
  the length of the list.  Many Haskell beginners might write something like\nthis:\n\n```haskell\nsumAndLength
  :: Num a => [a] -> (a, Int)\nsumAndLength xs = (sum xs, length xs)\n\n```\n\nHowever,
  this solution will leak space because it goes over the list in two\npasses.  If
  you demand the result of `sum` the Haskell runtime will materialize\nthe entire
  list.  However, the runtime cannot garbage collect the list because\nthe list is
  still required for the call to `length`.\n\nUsually people work around this by hand-writing
  a strict left fold that looks\nsomething like this:\n\n```haskell\n{-# LANGUAGE
  BangPatterns #-}\n\nimport Data.List (foldl')\n\nsumAndLength :: Num a => [a] ->
  (a, Int)\nsumAndLength xs = foldl' step (0, 0) xs\n  where\n    step (x, y) n =
  (x + n, y + 1)\n```\n\nThat now goes over the list in one pass, but will still leak
  space because the\ntuple is not strict in both fields!  You have to define a strict
  `Pair` type to\nfix this:\n\n```haskell\n{-# LANGUAGE BangPatterns #-}\n\nimport
  Data.List (foldl')\n\ndata Pair a b = Pair !a !b\n\nsumAndLength :: Num a => [a]
  -> (a, Int)\nsumAndLength xs = done (foldl' step (Pair 0 0) xs)\n  where\n    step
  (Pair x y) n = Pair (x + n) (y + 1)\n\n    done (Pair x y) = (x, y)\n```\n\n\nHowever,
  this is not satisfactory because you have to reimplement the guts of\nevery fold
  that you care about and also define a custom strict data type for\nyour fold.  Hand-writing
  the step function, accumulator, and strict data type\nfor every fold that you want
  to use gets tedious fast.  For example,\nimplementing something like reservoir sampling
  over and over is very error\nprone.\n\nWhat if you just stored the step function
  and accumulator for each individual\nfold and let some high-level library do the
  combining for you?  That's exactly\nwhat this library does!  Using this library
  you can instead write:\n\n```haskell\nimport qualified Control.Foldl as Fold\n\nsumAndLength
  :: Num a => [a] -> (a, Int)\nsumAndLength xs = Fold.fold ((,) <$> Fold.sum <*> Fold.length)
  xs\n\n-- or, more concisely:\nsumAndLength = Fold.fold ((,) <$> Fold.sum <*> Fold.length)\n```\n\nTo
  see how this works, the `Fold.sum` value is just a datatype storing the step\nfunction
  and the starting state (and a final extraction function):\n\n```haskell\nsum ::
  Num a => Fold a a\nsum = Fold (+) 0 id\n```\n\nSame thing for the `Fold.length`
  value:\n\n```haskell\nlength :: Fold a Int\nlength = Fold (\\n _ -> n + 1) 0 id\n```\n\n...
  and the `Applicative` operators combine them into a new datatype storing\nthe composite
  step function and starting state:\n\n```haskell\n(,) <$> Fold.sum <*> Fold.length
  = Fold step (Pair 0 0) done\n  where\n    step (Pair x y) = Pair (x + n) (y + 1)\n\n
  \   done (Pair x y) = (x, y)\n```\n\n... and then `fold` just transforms that to
  a strict left fold:\n\n```haskell\nfold (Fold step begin done) = done (foldl' step
  begin)\n```\n\nSince we preserve the step function and accumulator, we can use the
  `Fold` type to\nfold things other than pure collections.  For example, we can fold
  a `Producer`\nfrom `pipes` using the same `Fold`:\n\n```haskell\nFold.purely Pipes.Prelude.fold
  ((,) <$> sum <*> length)\n    :: (Monad m, Num a) => Producer a m () -> m (a, Int)\n```\n\nTo
  learn more about this library, read the documentation in\n[the main `Control.Foldl`
  module](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/foldl/docs/Control-Foldl.html).\n\n##
  Quick start\n\nInstall [the `stack` tool](http://haskellstack.org/) and then run:\n\n```bash\n$
  stack setup\n$ stack ghci foldl\nPrelude> import qualified Control.Foldl as Fold\nPrelude
  Fold> Fold.fold ((,) <$> Fold.sum <*> Fold.length) [1..1000000]\n(500000500000,1000000)\n```\n\n##
  How to contribute\n\nContribute a pull request if you have a `Fold` that you believe
  other people\nwould find useful.\n\n## Development Status\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Gabriel439/Haskell-Foldl-Library.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Gabriel439/Haskell-Foldl-Library)\n\nThe
  `foldl` library is pretty stable at this point.  I don't expect there to be\nbreaking
  changes to the API from this point forward unless people discover new\nbugs.\n\n##
