  ECC
  ---
  RSA just doesn't cut it anymore for fast public-key crypto. Keys are large for reasonable security making it quite slow...
  Enter elliptic curves: smaller numbers are necessary and everything is faster. Maybe this library is not for embedded system usage, but now people can experiment with ECC for those use-cases where some form of RSA would be chosen otherwise.


  Motivation
  ----------
  This is a side-project from which other people may benefit. Due to time-constraints, I can't work as much on it as I would like. If you use/like it or want to make some criticism heard, please write an email.
