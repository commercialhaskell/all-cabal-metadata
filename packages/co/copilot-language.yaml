  # Copilot: a stream DSL
  Copilot-language contains the actual embedded domain specific language that
  Copilot provides to its users. It comes with a series of basic operators and
  functionality, typically enough for most applications. Extended functionality
  is provided by the
  [copilot-libraries](https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot/tree/master/copilot-libraries)
  module.

  Copilot is a runtime verification framework written in Haskell. It allows the
  user to write programs in a simple but powerful way using a stream-based
  approach.

  Programs can be interpreted for testing, or translated C99 code to be
  incorporated in a project, or as a standalone application. The C99 backend
  ensures us that the output is constant in memory and time, making it suitable
  for systems with hard realtime requirements.


  ## Installation
  Copilot-language can be found on
  [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot-language). It is typically
  only installed as part of the complete Copilot distribution. For installation
  instructions, please refer to the [Copilot
  website](https://copilot-language.github.io).
