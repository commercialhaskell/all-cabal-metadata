description: "Confetti\n==========\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aviaviavi/confetti.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aviaviavi/confetti)\n\nConfetti
  is a tiny tool for managing different versions of a particular\nconfiguration file,
  and quickly swapping them.<br />\n\nConfetti is set up via a spec file, `~/.confetti.yml`.
  \nYou can specify one or more `groups`, each with one or more `targets`, \nwhich
  are the config files you wish to manage. \n\nSuppose we have multiple AWS credential
  files we want to easily switch between (ie use various `~/.aws/credentials`\nvariants).
  To use confetti for this task, we'll put our different files in the target directory,
  `~/.aws`, \nnamed `~/.aws/${variant-name}.credentials`. We might have:\n\n```\n~/.aws/personal.credentials\n~/.aws/work.credentials\n~/.aws/org_name.credentials\n```\n\nA
  simple example group specification in `~/confetti.yml` might look like:\n```\ngroups:\n
  \ - name: aws\n    targets:\n      - /home/you/.aws/credentials\n```\n\nTo switch
  to `work.credentials` simply run: \n```\n$ confetti [required group_name] [optional
  variant_name]\n```\neg.\n```\n$ confetti aws work\n> Setting aws to \"work\"\n>
  ~/.aws/credentials -> ~/.aws/work.credentials\n> Success (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧\n```\n\nAs
  you can see from the example output,\nthis will symlink `~/.aws/credentials` ->
  `~/.aws/work.credentials`. If the target file is \n_not_ a symlink when you invoke
  confetti, a backup will be made before your variant file is \nlinked. If you have
  multiple target files in your group, they will all be symlinked to their\nrespective
  variants.\n\nYou can specify alternative `search_paths` for each `group`, and whether
  or not to search recursively.\nAdding a new group with this functionality could
  make our .confetti.yml look like:\n\n```\ngroups:\n  - name: aws\n    targets:\n
  \     - ~/.aws/credentials\n  - name: dotfiles\n    targets:\n      - ~/.spacemacs\n
  \     - ~/.vimrc\n      - ~/.zshrc\n      - ~/.zpreztorc\n      - ~/.tmux.conf\n
  \     - ~/.tmux.style.conf\n    search_paths:\n      - path: ~/dotfiles\n        recursive:
  true\n```\n\nThis makes confetti a great tool for managing things like dotfiles,
  where the target config files\nare located in a github repo anywhere on the machine.
  Simply running:\n`confetti dotfiles` could link `~/.spacemacs` -> the first `.spacemacs`
  found in a recursive search of\n`~/dotfiles`. If your workflow involves regularly
  swapping any such files, the small amount of \ninitial configuration can be well
  worth the cost!\n\nOne last feature is that you can specify a top level `common`
  section that will \nbe applied to all other groups. For instance:\n\n```\ncommon:\n
  \ targets:\n      - ~/dir/some.file\n  search_paths:\n    - path: ~/some/directory\n
  \     recursive: false\n```\n\nNow, every group we try to use confetti for will
  also link `~/dir/some.file`, and\nwill also use `/some/directory` as a search path.\n\n##
  Installing\n\n### MacOS\n\nYou can install with brew via:\n```\n$ brew tap aviaviavi/homebrew-tap\n$
  brew install aviaviavi/homebrew-tap/confetti\n```\n\n### Linux \n\nA linux binary
  can be found on the releases page.\n\n### Source\n\nYou can install from source
  with [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).\n\n### Windows\n\nConfetti
  does not currently work on Windows, as there is some reliance on POSIX\nfor dealing
  with the file system. In theory it should be fairly straight-forward to\nget it
  working on Windows if anyone is up for implementing it. Feel encouraged to submit
  a PR\nor reach out for any related discussion.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions
  in any form are welcome!\n\n## Future Features\n\n* Config groups should be able
  to source bash files or sets of environment variables.\n"
