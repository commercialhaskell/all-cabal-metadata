description: "Testing this library:\r\n----------------------\r\n\"cabal build\" generates
  an executable that generates a Collada file.\r\nGenerateObjects.hs contains examples
  how to construct objects.\r\n\r\nCollada files can be viewed with nearly every major
  3d-Tool. For my tests I used ScenixViewer from NVidia,\r\nwhere the green play button
  on the right plays animations.\r\nTo see textures you have to copy the .png file
  to where the Collada-file is generated.\r\n\r\nFurther improvements:\r\n-------------------------\r\nThe
  data structures are not final, patches or suggestions are welcome.\r\nI would enjoy
  if the 3d graphics libraries on hackage would share data types to allow\r\nthe combination
  of libraries. I would even write a patch to YOUR library (if you allow me to).\r\nIf
  you make changes to this library, you can test the correctness\r\nof the generated
  files with the Collada refinery (coherency test under \"Conditioners\").\r\n\r\nChanges
  from 0.1 to 0.2\r\n------------------------\r\n- Textures working\r\n\r\n0.2 to
  0.3\r\n------------\r\n- Materials working again\r\n- Vec dependency removed\r\n\r\n0.2
  to 0.3\r\n------------\r\n- Animation improved\r\n- Visualization of a stream of
  positions. Enumeration of 3-tuples is used as an example"
