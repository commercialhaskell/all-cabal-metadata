  # Copilot: a stream DSL
  The interpreter, which evaluates Copilot specifications and prints
  their results over time.

  Copilot is a runtime verification framework written in Haskell. It allows the
  user to write programs in a simple but powerful way using a stream-based
  approach.

  Programs can be interpreted for testing (with the library copilot-interpreter),
  or translated C99 code to be incorporated in a project, or as a standalone
  application. The C99 backend ensures us that the output is constant in memory
  and time, making it suitable for systems with hard realtime requirements.

  ## Installation
  Copilot-interpreter can be found on
