  # co-log-simple


  ## Synopsis

  Simple enhancements for logging with co-log


  ## Description

  A library built upon co-log that makes constructing and using `LogAction`s
  simpler with some predefined formatters and a slightly enhanced Severity type

  This library expresses some logging needs that recur in my work:

  1. Often I want more than one type of "info" severity to differentiate between
     more- or less-chatty output that's not debug or warning/error related. This
     library includes a new Severity type that adds Notice between Info and
     Warning.
  2. I've often wanted different colors for severities which is much easier with
     co-log than hslogger
  3. This library also includes some functions for formatting different parts of
     a log message like the severity, stack info, or the message itself. These
     formatters can be composed together with the (%) and (%+) operators.

  Additionally:

  I found using the RichMsg/RichMessage types in co-log to be slightly on the
  complicated side to use. This library integrates timestamping through those
  types as well to make things easier while keeping the interface simple.

  co-log-simple uses the ISO8601 with zone offset format for timestamps by
  default which I like because it sorts. The time formatters in this library also
  support custom format strings as defined in the Data.Time.Format module in the
  base time library.

  For usage examples, see `src/examples/Main.hs` and the API docs for
  `Colog.Simple`


  ## Development

  Source code is available from Codeberg at the
  [co-log-simple](https://codeberg.org/dinofp/co-log-simple) project page.

  Handy command to generate Haddock docs during development if using stack. This
  constrains doc generation to modules in the library:

      $ stack haddock --haddock --no-haddock-deps
