  # co-log-simple


  ## Synopsis

  Simple enhancements for logging with co-log


  ## Description

  A library built upon co-log that makes constructing and using `LogAction`s
  simpler with some predefined formatters and a slightly enhanced Severity type

  This library expresses some logging needs that recur in my work:

  1. Often I want more than one type of "info" severity to differentiate between
     more- or less-chatty output that's not debug or warning/error related. This
     library includes a new Severity type that adds Notice between Info and
     Warning.
  2. I've often wanted different colors for severities which is much easier with
     co-log than hslogger
  3. This library also includes a variety of formatters that should prove useful
     for various types of projects

  For usage examples, see `src/examples/Main.hs` and the API docs for
  `Colog.Simple`


  ## Development

  Source code is available from Codeberg at the
  [co-log-simple](https://codeberg.org/dinofp/co-log-simple) project page.

  Generate Haddock docs during development if using stack:

      $ stack haddock --haddock --no-haddock-deps
