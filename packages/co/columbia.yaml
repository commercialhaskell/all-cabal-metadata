description: ! 'Fundamental problems have been discovered with the architecture of
  this library. It is no longer supported and its use is not recommended. If it is
  really needed, it is available in one of the old versions.


  Release notes for version 0.1.1:


  * Changed the invariant surrounding how files are seeked for reading/writing procedures.
  This permits an additional optimization. See Utils module for details.


  * Generalized the interface to Utils locking strategies to arbitrary monads incorporating
  exceptions and I/O.


  Release notes for version 0.1.2:


  * Minor bug fixes.


  Release notes for version 0.1.3:


  * Implemented additional functions specifically for handling dictionaries (''Map''s).


  * Added basic theory.'
