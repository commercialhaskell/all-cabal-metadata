  This is a standalone version of the powerful and intuitive command line
  functions present in the Shake build system.

  They are intended as an easy-to-remember, easy-to-use alternative
  to the System.Process functions.

  All credit goes to the Shake author!
  I hope he'll take it over as a standalone project.
