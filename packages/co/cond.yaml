changelog: |
  ## 0.5.0

  - Four monoid structures for a boolean algebra (`AnyB`, `AllB`, `XorB`, `EquivB`)
  - Typeclass altered so that {or, and, nor, nand, any, all} are no longer members
  - Add instances for `()` and `(a,b,c)`
  - `minimal` pragma (and corresponding definition)
  - The opposite Boolean algebra (exchanging `true` and `false`, `&&` and `||`, etc)
  - A more general instance for `Endo`
  - Tested with GHC 7.0 - 9.6


  ## 0.4.2

  - Add `instance Boolean b => Boolean (a -> b)`
  - Tested with GHC 7.0 - 9.6
