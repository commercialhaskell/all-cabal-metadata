  codecov-haskell [![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/guillaume-nargeot/codecov-haskell/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/guillaume-nargeot/codecov-haskell) [![Gitter chat](http://img.shields.io/badge/gitter-chat--room-brightgreen.svg)](https://gitter.im/guillaume-nargeot/codecov-haskell) [![BSD3 License](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSD3-brightgreen.svg)](https://tldrlegal.com/license/bsd-3-clause-license-%28revised%29) [![Version on Hackage](http://img.shields.io/hackage/v/codecov-haskell.svg)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/codecov-haskell)
  ===============

  codecov-haskell converts and sends Haskell projects hpc code coverage to [codecov.io](http://codecov.io/).

  At the moment, [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org), [Circle CI](https://circleci.com) and [Jenkins CI](https://jenkins-ci.org) have been tested,
  but codecov-haskell should be compatible with other CI services in the near future.

  codecov-haskell is still under development and any contributions are welcome!

  # Usage

  ## Travis CI

  Below is the simplest example of configuration for your project `.travis.yml`:
  ```yaml
  language: haskell
  ghc: 7.8
  script:
    - cabal configure --enable-tests --enable-library-coverage && cabal build && cabal test
  after_script:
    - cabal install codecov-haskell
    - codecov-haskell [options] [test-suite-names]
  ```

  If your build fails during the test phase with an error message starting by "hpc:", just replace the `cabal test` command by `run-cabal-test`, as in the following example:
  ```yaml
  before_install:
    - cabal install codecov-haskell
  script:
    - cabal configure --enable-tests --enable-library-coverage && cabal build
    - run-cabal-test [options] [cabal-test-options]
  after_script:
    - codecov-haskell [options] [test-suite-names]
  ```

  This will prevent the build to fail because of hpc related reasons, which are usually not fatal and should not affect the coverage data. Details are available in the next section.

  You may also experience some issues related to your project dependencies, which can be solved by using the `--avoid-reinstalls`/`--force-reinstalls` flags.</br>
  Another way to solve problems related dependencies is to install codecov-haskell in a sandbox, as in the example below:
  ```yaml
  after_script:
    - cabal sandbox init && cabal install codecov-haskell
    - .cabal-sandbox/bin/codecov-haskell [options] [test-suite-names]
  ```

  ## Circle CI

  In your test section of your `circle.yml` add the following:
  ```yaml
  test:
    pre:
      - cabal install codecov-haskell
      - cabal configure --enable-tests --enable-library-coverage
      - cabal build
    override:
      - cabal test
    post:
      - codecov-haskell [options] [test-suite-names]
  ```

  If your build fails during the test phase with an error message starting by "hpc:", just replace the `cabal test` command by `run-cabal-test`, as in the following example:
  ```yaml
  test:
    pre:
      - cabal install codecov-haskell
      - cabal configure --enable-tests --enable-library-coverage
      - cabal build
    override:
      - run-cabal-test
    post:
      - codecov-haskell [options] [test-suite-names]
  ```

  ## Jenkins CI
  In your build script add the following commands:
  ```bash
  cabal install codecov-haskell
  cabal configure --enable-tests --enable-library-coverage && cabal build && cabal test
  codecov-haskell [options] [test-suite-names]
  ```

  If your build fails during the test phase with an error message starting by "hpc:", just replace the `cabal test` command by `run-cabal-test`, as in the following example:
  ```bash
  cabal install codecov-haskell
  cabal configure --enable-tests --enable-library-coverage && cabal build
  run-cabal-test [options] [cabal-test-options]
  codecov-haskell [options] [test-suite-names]
  ```

  ## The run-cabal-test command

  Under certain conditions related to the project structure and the version of hpc, `cabal test` may output an error message and exit with the error code `1`, which would result in a build failure.<br/>

  To prevent this from happening, codecov-haskell provides the `run-cabal-test` command which runs `cabal test` and returns with `0` if the following regular expression never matches any line of the output:

  ```perl
  /^Test suite .*: FAIL$/
  ```

  Below are some of the conditions under which you will likely need to use `run-cabal-test`:
  - when using GHC 7.6 (hpc 0.6 known issue)
  - when using GHC 7.8 with multiple test suites covering the same module(s)

  ### Options

  The `--cabal-name` option can be used to specify a custom executable name instead of the default `cabal` when calling `cabal test`.<br/>
  Below is an example which can be useful for projects with a Travis configuration based on [multi-ghc-travis](https://github.com/hvr/multi-ghc-travis):

  ```yaml
  run-cabal-test --cabal-name=cabal-1.20
  ```

  ## The codecov-haskell command

  This command parses the hpc generated output, converts its to Codecov json format and finally sends it to codecov.io over http.<br/>
  Multiple test suites can be specified, in which case the coverage report will be made of the merged coverage data generated by the specified test suites.<br/>
  For example, if your test suite are named `test1` and `test2`, use the command as follows:

  ```yaml
  codecov-haskell test1 test2
  ```

  ### Options

  #### --exclude-dir

  The `--exclude-dir` option allows to exclude source files located under a given directory from the coverage report.<br/>
  You can exclude source files located under the `test/` directory by using this option as in the following example:

  ```yaml
  codecov-haskell --exclude-dir=test [test-suite-names]
  ```

  You can specify multiple excluded folders by using the following example syntax:

  ```yaml
  codecov-haskell --exclude-dir=test1 --exclude-dir=test2 [test-suite-names]
  ```

  #### --display-report

  This boolean option prints the raw json coverage report to be sent to codecov.io.

  #### --dont-send

  This boolean option prevents codecov-haskell from sending the coverage report to codecov.io.
  This option can be used together with `--display-report` for testing purpose.<br/>
  For example, you can try various combinations of the other options and confirm the difference in the resulting report outputs.

  #### --print-response

  This boolean option prints the raw json response received after posting the coverage report to codecov.io.

  # Limitations

  ## Total coverage

  Because of the way hpc works, coverage data is only generated for modules that are referenced directly or indirectly by the test suites.
  As a result, the total package coverage computed by Codecov may be higher than what it really is.
  An option will be added soon in order to allow specifying source folders to include in the total coverage computation.

  ## Expression level coverage

  Even though hpc supports expression level coverage, this version of codecov-haskell does not support it yet, but this feature will be implemented soon.
  Meanwhile, the hpc coverage information is converted into a line based report, in which a line can be: fully covered (green), partially covered (yellow) and not covered (red).
