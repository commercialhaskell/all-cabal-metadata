  Joins text items together by separating these with commas, and "and" at the end.

  ## Usage

  We can combine elements with:

  ```
  ghci> comma ["red", "green", "blue"]
  "red, green, and blue"
  ```

  The package has tooling for the two different comma styles, and can work with any *string-like* type.

  ## `comma-and` is *safe* Haskell

  The module is compiled with `Safe` and does not depend on unsafe modules.
