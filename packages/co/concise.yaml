  Utilities for ``Control.Lens.Cons``
  ===================================

  This library provides a few utility types and functions for working
  with ``Control.Lens.Cons``.  Rewrite rules are employed to make
  common conversions perform as well as the "native" but non-generic
  conversion (e.g. ``String`` to ``Text``, lazy to strict, etc).
