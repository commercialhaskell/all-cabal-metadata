  # Welcome to configurator

  This is a library for configuring Haskell daemons and programs.

  Its features include:

  * Automatic, dynamic reloading in response to modifications to
    configuration files.

  * A simple, but flexible, configuration language, supporting several
    of the most commonly needed types of data, along with interpolation
    of strings from the configuration or the system environment
    (e.g. `$(HOME)`).

  * Subscription-based notification of changes to configuration
    properties.

  * An `import` directive allows the configuration of a complex
    application to be split across several smaller files, or
    configuration data to be shared across several applications.

  # Configuration file format

  For details of the configuration file format, see [the Haddock documentation](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/configurator/latest/doc/html/Data-Configurator.html).
