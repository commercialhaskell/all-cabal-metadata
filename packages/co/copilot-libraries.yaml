  # Copilot: a stream DSL
  User-supplied libraries for Copilot, including linear-temporal logic,
  fault-tolerant voting, regular expressions, etc.

  Copilot is a runtime verification framework written in Haskell. It allows the
  user to write programs in a simple but powerful way using a stream-based
  approach.

  Programs can be interpreted for testing, or translated C99 code to be
  incorporated in a project, or as a standalone application. The C99 backend
  ensures us that the output is constant in memory and time, making it suitable
  for systems with hard realtime requirements.
