  # Conferer

  ## what, why and a bit of how

  VERY UNSTABLE DON'T USE IN PRODUCTION JUST YET

  Conferer is a library that defines ways to get configuration for your Haskell
  application and the libraries it uses, which is at heart string keys which map
  to other strings.

  To get this map we use `Providers` which define a way to get a key (eg.
  `db.username`) that may or may not exist, we then use a list of providers for
  getting the value for that key (position on the list defines priority). This
  allows adding new providers easily (for example a dhall file provider,
  a git repo or a etcd database)

  The other side of this is that we have the `FromConfig` which gets some value
  from a `Config` at a certain key possibly using only keys under some namespacing
  key

  ## Example (not implemented)

  Let's say I want to configure warp. Let's say we wrote this program.

  ```haskell
  main = do
    -- by default gets cli parameters, envvars and json file
    config <- getDefaultConfigFor "awesomeapp"
    warpConfig :: Warp.Settings <- getKey "warp" config

    Warp.runSettings warpConfig myApp
  ```

  Now I need to chage the port of the app, I can change it by either:

  * Setting cli params like `./myApp -Cwarp.port=5555`
  * Setting an environment variable called `AWESOMEAPP_WARP_PORT=5555`
  * In a json file you can have `{"warp": {"port": 5555}}`

  And you may also get that value from different configuration providers like
  redis or etc or whichever you may need.

  ## Utilities

  There are as well some utilities to change providers:

  * `Conferer.Provider.Namespace`: All keys must be namespaced and the namespace
    is striped for lookup
  * `Conferer.Provider.Mapped`: Using a map key to maybe key you can change the
    name of a key or even hiding some key
  * `Conferer.Provider.Simple`: Get keys from a hardcoded map key to string

  ## Future maybe things

  * Interpolate keys with other keys: `{a: "db", b: "${a}_thing"}`, getting `b`
    will give `"db_thing"` (maybe)
  * A LOT of providers
  * A LOT of `FromConfig` implementations
