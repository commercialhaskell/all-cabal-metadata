changelog: |
  0.8.3 [2021.02.21]
  ------------------
  * Fix the build with `safecopy-0.10.4` or later.

  0.8.2 [2021.02.17]
  ------------------
  * Allow building with `lens-5.*`.
  * The build-type has been changed from `Custom` to `Simple`.
    To achieve this, the `doctests` test suite has been removed in favor of using
    [`cabal-docspec`](https://github.com/phadej/cabal-extras/tree/master/cabal-docspec)
    to run the doctests.

  0.8.1 [2020.01.29]
  ------------------
  * Add a benchmark suite.

  0.8 [2019.11.24]
  ----------------
  * Support building with `log-domain-0.13` by removing the `Precise` superclass
    from `Compensable`. `log-domain-0.13` has removed the `Precise` class since
    its methods are now available in `Floating` as of `base-4.9`/GHC 8.0. As a
    result, this release drops support for earlier versions of `base`/GHC.

  0.7.3 [2019.09.13]
  ------------------
  * Allow building with `safecopy-0.10`.

  0.7.2
  -----
  * Add a library dependency on the `doctests` test suite

  0.7.1
  -----
  * Revamp `Setup.hs` to use `cabal-doctest`. This makes it build
    with `Cabal-2.0`, and makes the `doctest`s work with `cabal new-build` and
    sandboxes.

  0.7
  ---
  * Support for newer `bifunctors`, `cereal`, `deepseq`, `generic-deriving`, `semigroupoid` and `vector` dependencies.`

  0.6
  ---
  * Updated for `lens` 4.
  * Bug fix in `(/=)`

  0.4.1
  -----
  * Marked this package `Trustworthy`.

  0.4
  ---
  * Added `NFData` and `Serial` instances

  0.3
  ---
  * Major version bump due to large semantics change in `log-domain`.

  0.2.0.1
  -------
  * Wider `generic-deriving` version bounds for GHC HEAD compatibility.

  0.2
  ---
  * Added a `Hashable` instance.

  0.1.1.1
  -------
  * Wider `binary` version bounds.

  0.1.1
  -----
  * Fixed a bug in the `Setup.lhs` `postHaddock` hook.
  * Reformatted haddocks

  0.1
  ---
  * Split from [analytics](https://github.com/analytics/analytics)

  ===========

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/compensated.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/compensated) [![Build Status](https://github.com/ekmett/compensated/workflows/Haskell-CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ekmett/compensated/actions?query=workflow%3AHaskell-CI)

  This package provides a form of compensated arithmetic that lets you perform many operations on chains of doubles at higher precision.

  In particular addition, multiplication, etc. on a `Compensated Double` is done with twice as many bits of `significand` as on a raw `Double`.

  This construction is designed so that it can be iterated.

  This was forked from the [analytics](http://github.com/analytics/analytics.git) repository after repeated requests.

  Work still needs to be done to properly support most `Floating` operations, but everything below that level of the numeric hierarchy should work.
