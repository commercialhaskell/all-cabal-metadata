  ## Description

  There is a clear separation between color models, color spaces and alternative
  representations of color spaces. All are distinct at the type level. The goal is to
  prevent mixups of incompatible color types as well as utilize type information for
  conversion between them.

  Currently supported:

  * Color models:

    * `Y`
    * `RGB`
    * `HSI`
    * `HSL`
    * `HSV`
    * `YCbCr`
    * `CMYK`

  * Color spaces and arbitrary conversions between them:

    * `Y` - luminance
    * `Y'` - luma
    * `CIE XYZ`
    * `CIE L*a*b*`
    * `DIN99`
    * `RGB`:

      * `sRGB` - both standardized and derived
      * `AdobeRGB` - both standardized and derived
      * ITU: `Rec470`, `Rec601` and `Rec709`
      * Alternative representations:

        * `HSI`
        * `HSL`
        * `HSV`
        * `YCbCr`
        * `CMYK`

  * Illuminants:

    * CIE1931 - 2 degree observer
    * CIE1964 - 10 degree observer
    * Some common alternatives

  * Chromatic adaptation:

    * VonKries adaptation with transformations:

        * `VonKries`
        * `Bradford` (default)
        * `Fairchild`
        * `CIECAM02`
        * `CMCCAT2000`

  * Color Standards:

    * RAL
    * SVG

  ## Example

  Here is a short example how this library can be used. Here we assume a GHCi session that
  can be started like so:

  ```shell
  $ stack ghci --package Color
  ```

  ### Perceived lightness

  Let's say we need find the perceived lightness as described in [this StackOverflow
  answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/596216/formula-to-determine-perceived-brightness-of-rgb-color/56678483#56678483)
  for an RGB triple `(128, 255, 65) :: (Word8, Word8, Word8)`.

  Before we can attempt getting the lightness we need to do these two things:

  1. Figure out what is the color space of the `RGB` triplet? In particular the `Illuminant`
     and the `Linearity` of the `RGB` color space.
  2. Convert your `RGB` color to [`CIE
     L*a*b*`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space) and then we can get the `L*`
     out, which is the perceived lightness.

  More often than not an RGB image will be encoded in non-linear sRGB color space with 8 bits
  per channel, so we'll use that for this example:

  ```haskell
  ghci> :set -XDataKinds
  ghci> import Graphics.Color.Space
  ghci> let rgb8 = ColorSRGB 128 255 65 :: Color (SRGB 'NonLinear) Word8
  ghci> print rgb8
  <SRGB 'NonLinear:(128,255, 65)>
  ```

  Before we convert `sRGB` to `CIE L*a*b*` color space we need to increase the precision to
  `Double`, because for now `Word8` is not supported by the `LAB` color space implementation:

  ```haskell
  ghci> let rgb = toDouble <$> rgb8
  ghci> print rgb
  <SRGB 'NonLinear:( 0.5019607843137255, 1.0000000000000000, 0.2549019607843137)>
  ```

  In order to convert to another color space without changing the `Illuminant` we can use
  `convertColor` function. So here is how we convert to CIELAB and extract the perceived
  lightness `L*`:

  ```haskell
  ghci> let lab@(ColorLAB l _ _) = convertColor rgb :: Color (LAB D65) Double
  ghci> lab
  <LAB * D65:(90.0867507593648500,-65.7999116680496000,74.4643898323530600)>
  ghci> l
  90.08675075936485
  ```

  ### Color adaptation

  When a change of `Illuminant` is also needed during color space conversion we can use
  `convert` function

  ```haskell
  ghci> import Graphics.Color.Adaptation (convert)
  ghci> import qualified Graphics.Color.Illuminant.CIE1964 as CIE1964
  ghci> let lab@(ColorLAB l _ _) = convert rgb :: Color (LAB 'CIE1964.D50) Double
  ghci> lab
  <LAB CIE1964 'D50:(90.2287735564601500,-59.3846969983265500,72.9304679742930800)>
  ```
