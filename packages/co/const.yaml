  const
  =====

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/const.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/const)

  This package provides a small shim around the data types and operations in `Foreign` and `Data.Primitive`
  for emulating const-correctness from a C perspective.

  In the future it'd be nice to have a proper const-cast that can handle nested ConstPtr's, etc. but this suffices
  for my current usecases. Patches welcome!
