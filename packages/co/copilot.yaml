  # Copilot

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Copilot-Language/copilot.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/Copilot-Language/copilot)
  [![Version on Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/copilot.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot)

  Copilot is a runtime verification framework for hard real-time systems.
  Programs can be interpreted for testing, or translated into C99 code to be
  incorporated in a project or standalone application. The C99 code generated
  is constant in memory and time, making it suitable for systems with hard
  real-time requirements.

  [Documentation](#documentation) •

  </div>

  ## Features

  - Write simple, high-level specifications using a stream-based language.

  - Produce hard real-time C99 runtime monitors that run in constant memory and time.

  - Catch errors in specifications early using expressive static type system.

  - Prove properties about specifications using theorem proving extensions.

  - Interpret specifications for testing and debugging purposes.

  - Obtain proofs of correctness of the generated code.

  # Installation
  <sup>[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

  ## Linux installation
  <sup>[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

  ### Debian Bookworm / Ubuntu 23.04

  On Debian Bookworm / Ubuntu 23.04 or newer, Copilot can be installed directly
  from the package repositories with:

  ```sh
  $ sudo apt-get install libghc-copilot-dev
  ```

  To test that Copilot is available, execute the following:
  ```sh
  $ ghci <<< 'import Language.Copilot'
  ```

  It should end with a line like the following and not print any error messages:
  ```sh
  ghci> ghci> Leaving GHCi.
  ```

  ### Fedora 40

  On Fedora 40 or newer, Copilot can be installed directly from the package
  repositories with:

  ```sh
  $ sudo dnf install ghc-copilot-devel
  ```

  To test that Copilot is available, execute the following:
  ```sh
  $ ghci <<< 'import Language.Copilot'
  ```

  It should end with a line like the following and not print any error messages:
  ```sh
  ghci> ghci> Leaving GHCi.
  ```

  ### Other Linux distributions

  On other Linux distributions or older Debian-based distributions, to use
  Copilot you must install a Haskell compiler (GHC) and the package manager
  Cabal. We currently support all versions of GHC from 8.6.5 to modern versions
  (9.8 as of this writing). You can install the toolchain using
  [ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) or, if you are on Debian/Ubuntu,
  directly with `apt-get`:

  ```sh
  $ sudo apt-get install ghc cabal-install
  ```

  Once the compiler is installed, install Copilot from
  [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot) with:

  ```sh
  cabal v2-install --lib copilot
  ```

  To test that Copilot is available, execute the following:
  ```sh
  $ ghci <<< 'import Language.Copilot'
  ```

  It should end with a line like the following and not print any error messages:
  ```sh
  ghci> ghci> Leaving GHCi.
  ```

  ## Mac installation
  <sup>[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

  To use Copilot you must have a Haskell compiler (GHC) and the package manager
  Cabal. We currently support all versions of GHC from 8.6.5 to modern versions
  (9.6 as of this writing). You can install the toolchain using
  [ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/), as well as with Homebrew:

  ```sh
  $ brew install ghc cabal-install
  ```

  Once the compiler is installed, install Copilot from
  [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot) with:

  ```sh
  $ cabal v2-install --lib copilot
  ```

  To test that Copilot is available, execute the following:
  ```sh
  $ ghci <<< 'import Language.Copilot'
  ```

  It should end with a line like the following and not print any error messages:
  ```sh
  ghci> ghci> Leaving GHCi.
  ```

  ## Troubleshooting
  <sup>[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

  Feel free to open an issue if you are unable to install Copilot following these
  instructions.

  There is a TravisCI file at the root of the repository that may help with
  troubleshooting the installation. Our issues often include comments with
  Dockerfiles listing the steps necessary to install Copilot from scratch.

  ## Examples
  <sup>[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

  Here follows a simple example of a heating system. More examples can be found
  in the [examples
  directory](https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot/tree/master/copilot/examples)
  of the main repository.

  ```haskell
  -- This example implements a simple home heating system. The system heats
  -- when the temperature gets too low, and stops when it is high enough. It read
  -- temperature as a byte (range -50C to 100C) and translates this to Celsius.

  module Heater where

  import Language.Copilot
  import Copilot.Compile.C99

  import Prelude hiding ((>), (<), div)

  -- External temperature as a byte, ranging from -50C to 100C.
  temp :: Stream Word8
  temp = extern "temperature" Nothing

  -- Temperature in Celsius.
  --
  -- We need to cast the Word8 to a Float. This is an unsafeCast, as there
  -- is no direct relation between Word8 and Float.
  ctemp :: Stream Float
  ctemp = (unsafeCast temp) * (150.0 / 255.0) - 50.0

  spec = do
    -- Triggers that fire when the ctemp is too low or too high,
    -- pass the current ctemp as an argument.
    trigger "heaton"  (ctemp < 18.0) [arg ctemp]
    trigger "heatoff" (ctemp > 21.0) [arg ctemp]

  -- Compile the spec
  main = reify spec >>= compile "heater"
  ```

  If you save this example in a file `Heater.hs` and run:
  ```sh
  $ runhaskell Heater.hs
  ```
  it will produce the files `heater.c`, `heater.h` and `heater_types.h`,
  containing, respectively, the implementation of the monitors, the interface,
  and a declaration of any types declared in the specification (empty in this
  case).

  If you clone the repository, the examples in the `examples/` directory can be
  run from the root of the project. As a rule of thumb, each example is named
  after the filename (without extension) in lowercase letters, and directory
  separators replaced with a '-'. For example:

  ```sh
  $ cabal run addmult -f examples
  $ cabal run counter -f examples
  $ cabal run what4-arithmetic -f examples
  ```
