  # Copilot: Stream DSL for hard real-time runtime verification

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Copilot-Language/Copilot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Copilot-Language/Copilot)
  [![Version on Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/copilot.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot)

  Copilot is a runtime verification framework written in Haskell. It allows the
  user to write programs in a simple but powerful way using a stream-based
  approach.

  Programs can be interpreted for testing, or translated C99 code to be
  incorporated in a project, or as a standalone application. The C99 backend
  output is constant in memory and time, making it suitable for systems with hard
  realtime requirements.


  ## Installation
  There are two ways to install Copilot:

  * From Hackage (recommended):

    The Copilot library is cabalized. Assuming you have cabal, the GHC
    compiler installed (the
    [Haskell Platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/) is the easiest way
    to obtain these), and an Internet connection, it should merely be a matter of running:

        cabal install copilot

  * Building from source from the GitHub repositories (typically, one would only
    go this route to develop Copilot):

        git clone https://github.com/Copilot-Language/Copilot.git
        cd Copilot
        git submodule update --init --remote
        make

  Note there is a TravisCI build (linked to at the top of this README) if you
  have trouble building/installing.


  ## Example
  Here follows a simple example of a heating system. Other examples can be found
  in the [Examples
  directory](https://github.com/Copilot-Language/Copilot/tree/master/Examples)
  of the main repository.

      -- This is a simple example with basic usage. It implements a simple home
      -- heating system: It heats when temp gets too low, and stops when it is high
      -- enough. It read temperature as an byte (range -50C to 100C) and translates
      -- this to Celcius.

      module Heater where

      import Language.Copilot
      import Copilot.Compile.C99

      import Prelude hiding ((>), (<), div)

      -- External temperature as a byte, range of -50C to 100C
      temp :: Stream Int8
      temp = extern "temperature" Nothing

      -- Calculate temperature in Celcius.
      -- We need to cast the Int8 to a Float. Note that it is an unsafeCast, as there
      -- is no direct relation between Int8 and Float.
      ctemp :: Stream Float
      ctemp = ((unsafeCast temp) / 150.0) - 50.0

      spec = do
        -- Triggers that fire when the ctemp is too low or too hight,
        -- pass the current ctemp as an argument.
        trigger "heaton"  (ctemp < 18.0) [arg ctemp]
        trigger "heafoff" (ctemp > 21.0) [arg ctemp]

      -- Compile the spec
      main = reify spec >>= compile "heater"


  ## Contributions
  Feel free to open new issues and send pull requests.

  In order to contribute to Copilot, please use the following steps which will
  make the process of evaluating and including your changes much easier:

  * Create an issue for every individual change or problem with Copilot. Document
    the issue well.

  * Always comment on the issues you are addressing in every commit. Be
    descriptive, and use the syntax `#<issue_number>` so that we can track
    changes and issues easily.

  * Every commit should mention one issue and, ideally, only one.

  * Do not send a PR or commit that addresses multiple problems, unless they are
    related and cannot be separated.

  * Do not commit to master directly, except for branch merges. Make sure you
    always merge onto master using `--no-ff` so that we can tell that features
    were addressed separately, completed, tested, and then merged.  If you are a
    Copilot developer, create a branch for every issue you are addressing, complete
    it, and then merge onto master. Document every commit in every branch,
    including the last merge commit, stating the issues it addresses or closes.

  This process is similar to [Git
  Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). The equivalent
  of Git Flow's master branch is our latest tag, and the equivalent of Git Flow's
  develop branch is our master.
