  # Copilot: a stream DSL
  Copilot-Bluespec implements a Bluespec backend for Copilot, producing code that
  is suitable for FPGAs.

  Copilot is a runtime verification framework written in Haskell. It allows the
  user to write programs in a simple but powerful way using a stream-based
  approach.

  Programs can be interpreted for testing, or translated Bluespec code to be
  incorporated in a project, or as a standalone application. The Bluespec backend
  ensures us that the output is constant in memory and time, making it suitable
  for systems with hard realtime requirements.

  ## Installation
  Copilot-Bluespec can be found on
  [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot-bluespec). It is
  typically only installed as part of the complete Copilot distribution. For
  installation instructions, please refer to the [Copilot
  website](https://copilot-language.github.io).

  The generated Bluespec code requires `bsc` (the Bluespec compiler) in order to
  be compiled. `bsc` can be downloaded
  [here](https://github.com/B-Lang-org/bsc/releases).
