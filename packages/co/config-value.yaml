synopsis: Simple, layout-based value language similar to YAML or JSON
changelog: |
  0.8.2.1
  ---
  * Fix pretty-printing bug with long string literals

  0.8.2
  ---
  * Add `+` and `-` to the set of layout-based list syntax bullets.
    All elements of the list are checked to see that a consistent
    bullet is used. Different bullets might be used to help make
    nested lists more understandable. `-` might be used to make things
    look more like YAML

  0.8.1
  ---
  * Allow underscores in number literals
    Copied from <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0076-numeric-underscores.rst#new-syntax-this-proposal>

    Underscores are allowed and ignored
    - in the *middle* of integer-parts of the literal syntax
    - between base-markers (0x, 0o, 0b) and number part
    - before the `eEpP` part of an exponent

  0.8
  ---
  * Allow atoms and section names to start with `@` or `$`
  * Add `Config.Macro` module

  0.7.0.1
  ---

  * Fix pretty-printing of fractional, hexadecimal numbers

  0.7.0.0
  ---
  * Updated number representation to preserve fractional part
    and added new `Config.Number` module with operations on
    this new type.

  0.6.3.1
  ---
  * Build on GHC 8.4.1

  0.6.3
  ---
  * Add `valuePlate`

  0.6.2.1
  ---
  * Fixed error output for unexpected floating point literal

  0.6.2
  ---
  * Nicer errors on unterminated inline lists and sections.
  * Stop enforcing well-formed text files

  0.6.1
  ---
  * Add vim syntax highlighting file
  * Fix string gaps, they shouldn't require a newline

  0.6
  ---
  * Annotate `Value` with file positions
  * Derive `Generic1` instances for `Value`

  0.5.1
  ---
  * Allow trailing commas in lists and section lists
  * Support inline section lists using `{}`
  * Add more documentation

  0.5
  ----
  * Add support for floating-point numbers

  0.4.0.2
  ----
  * Internal lexer and parser improvements
  * Added support for `\&` escape sequence

  0.4.0.1
  ----
  * Loosen version constraints to build back to GHC 7.4.2
  * Remove unused bytestring dependency

  0.4
  ----
  * Make `Atom` a newtype to help distinguish it from `Text`
  * Add `values` traversal for traversing individual elements of a list

  0.3
  -----
  * Replace `yes` and `no` with generalized atoms
  * Add character index to error position
  * Add human readable error messages

  0.2
  -----
  * Take `Text` as the input to `parse`

  0.1.1
  -----
  * Added `Config.Lens` module
  * Added aligned fields to pretty printer

  0.1
  -----
  * Initial release

  # config-value

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/config-value.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/config-value) [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/glguy/config-value.svg)](http://travis-ci.com/glguy/config-value)

  This package implements a simple, layout-based value definition language
  used for supplying configuration values to various applications.

  Before starting to use config-value, you probably want to read the documentation for [config-schema](https://github.com/glguy/config-schema) to see the user-friendly way to wrap this library.

  Live Demo
  --------

  The config-value and config-schema packages are available in a [live demo](https://glguy.net/config-demo/).

  Example
  -------
  ```
  -- Line comments until newline
  layout:
    based:
      configuration:
        {} -- empty section

      inline-maps: {key1: value1, key2: value2}

      sections:
       "glguy"

      {- Block comments
         {- nested comments -}
         "O'caml style {- strings in comments"
         so you can comment out otherwise valid
         portions of your config
      -}
      atoms:       yes

      decimal:     -1234
      hexadecimal: 0x1234
      octal:       0o1234
      binary:      0b1010

      floats:      [1e2, 0x3p-5, 24.48]
      underscores: 1_000_000

  lists:
     * sections: in-lists
       next-section: still-in-list
     * [ "inline", "lists" ]
     * * "nestable"
       * "layout"
       * "lists"
     * 3

  unicode: "standard Haskell format strings (1 ≤ 2)x2228(2 ≤ 3)"

  multiline: "haskell style\
             \string gaps"
  ```

  Format
  ------

  The language supports: Strings, Atoms, Integers, Lists, Nested Sections.

  Sections are layout based. The contents of a section must be indented further than the section heading.
  The whitespace between a section heading and its colon is not significant. Section names must start with
  a letter and may contain letters, numbers, dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), and periods (`.`).

  Lists are either layout based with `*` prefixes or inline surrounded by `[` and `]` delimited by `,`

  Strings are surrounded by `"` and use Haskell-style escapes.

  Numbers support decimal, hexadecimal (`0x`), octal (`0o`), and binary (`0b`).

  Atoms follow the same lexical rule as section heading.
