  # conic-graphs

  Vinyl-style extensible graphs.

  A [vinyl](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vinyl) style extensible record is
  a hetrogenous list, using a type-level list to track the indicies. The
  constructors of `Rec` mirror the constructors of the list used to index them.

  ```{.haskell}
  data Rec :: (u -> *) -> [u] -> * where
    RNil :: Rec f '[]
    (:&) :: !(f r) -> !(Rec f rs) -> Rec f (r ': rs)
  ```

  We can apply the same method to the
  [algebraic-graphs](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs)
  definition, albeit with four constructors instead of two.

  ```{.haskell}
  data RGraph :: (u -> *) -> Graph u -> * where
    REmpty :: RGraph f 'Empty
    RVertex :: !(f r) -> RGraph f ('Vertex r)
    ROverlay :: !(RGraph f xs) -> !(RGraph f ys) -> RGraph f ('Overlay xs ys)
    RConnect :: !(RGraph f xs) -> !(RGraph f ys) -> RGraph f ('Connect xs ys)
  ```

  Then each vertex of the `RGraph` may be of a different type, with the types
  tracked in the type level `Graph`.

  ```{.haskell}
  type G = 'Connect ('Vertex Int) ('Vertex String)

  myGraph :: RGraph Identity G
  myGraph = RConnect (RVertex (Identity 5)) (RVertex (Identity "foo"))
  ```

  Using [fcf-graphs](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fcf-graphs), we are able
  to perform type-level graph computations to match the operations at the term
  level.

  ```{.haskell}
  edge :: f a -> f b -> RGraph f (Eval (Edge a b))
  edge x y = RConnect (RVertex x) (RVertex y)
  ```

  Including, collapsing RGraphs to vinyl Recs by computing the type level list of
  vertex types.

  ```{.haskell}
  data VertexList :: Graph a -> Exp [a]

  type instance Eval (VertexList 'Empty) = '[]

  type instance Eval (VertexList ('Vertex x)) = '[x]

  type instance Eval (VertexList ('Overlay x y)) = Eval (LiftM2 (++) (VertexList x) (VertexList y))

  type instance Eval (VertexList ('Connect x y)) = Eval (LiftM2 (++) (VertexList x) (VertexList y))

  vertexList :: RGraph f xs -> Rec f (Eval (VertexList xs))
  vertexList REmpty = RNil
  vertexList (RVertex x) = x :& RNil
  vertexList (ROverlay x y) = rappend (vertexList x) (vertexList y)
  vertexList (RConnect x y) = rappend (vertexList x) (vertexList y)
  ```

  ```
  ghci> vertexList myGraph
  {5, "foo"}
  ```

  (Note, we use a different version of rappend that makes it more obvious to fcf
  that this is what we mean, defined in [fcf-vinyl](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fcf-vinyl).
