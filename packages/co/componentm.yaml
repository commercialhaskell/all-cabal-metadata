  Make sure you include the following entry on your [cabal file's
  dependecies](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/developing-packages.html#build-information)
  section.

  ```cabal
  library:
    build-depends: componentm
  ```

  Or on your `package.yaml`

  ```
  dependencies:
  - componentm
  ```

  ## Purpose

  This library is intended to be a high level API for the
  [teardown](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/teardown) library; it provides a
  high level monad interface that helps composition of resource
  allocation/teardown in a safe and reliable way.

  ### Differences with ResourceT

  The [resourcet](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/resourcet) library provides a
  monad transformer that keeps track of allocated resources at runtime making sure
  that if an exception happens or the block of execution finishes, the resources
  allocated are cleaned up.

  The [componentm](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/componentm) library on the
  other hand, does not run as a Monad transformer, but rather it gets called at
  the very beginning of your application, it builds the _environment_ needed by
  your application environment to work (e.g. [Layer
  1](http://www.parsonsmatt.org/2018/03/22/three_layer_haskell_cake.html)), and
  provides helper _bracket style_ functions that cleanup all allocated resources
  in the right order when your application terminates either normally or with an
  error.
