  # Copilot: a stream DSL
  Copilot-c99 implements a C99 backend for Copilot, producing high quality code
  suitable for hard realtime applications.

  Copilot is a runtime verification framework written in Haskell. It allows the
  user to write programs in a simple but powerful way using a stream-based
  approach.

  Programs can be interpreted for testing, or translated C99 code to be
  incorporated in a project, or as a standalone application. The C99 backend
  ensures us that the output is constant in memory and time, making it suitable
  for systems with hard realtime requirements.


  ## Installation
  Copilot-c99 can be found on
  [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot-c99). It is typically
  only installed as part of the complete Copilot distribution. For installation
  instructions, please refer to the [Copilot
  website](https://copilot-language.github.io).
