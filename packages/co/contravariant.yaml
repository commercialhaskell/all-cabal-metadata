synopsis: Contravariant functors
changelog: |
  1.5.5 [2021.07.27]
  ------------------
  * Fix the build on old GHCs using `transformers-0.6.*`.

  1.5.4 [2021.07.25]
  ------------------
  * Allow building with `transformers-0.6.*`.

  1.5.3 [2020.12.30]
  ------------------
  * Explicitly mark modules as `Safe`.

  1.5.2 [2019.06.03]
  ------------------
  * Mark `Data.Functor.Contravariant` and `Data.Functor.Contravariant.Generic`
    as unconditionally `Trustworthy`.

  1.5.1 [2019.05.02]
  ------------------
  * Remove the use of `unsafeCoerce` in `Data.Functor.Contravariant.Generic`. As
    a result, the `safe` flag has been removed, as it is no longer used.

  1.5 [2018.07.01]
  ----------------
  * Support building with GHC 8.6, where `Data.Functor.Contravariant` has been
    moved into `base`.

  1.4.1 [2018.01.18]
  ------------------
  * Add `Semigroup` and `Monoid` instances for `Predicate`.
  * Add lots of documentation explaining `Contravariant`, `Divisible`, and
    `Decidable`.
  * Fix some dodgy CPP usage that caused the build to fail on Eta.

  1.4
  ---
  * Improved the performance of `Deciding` at the cost of downgrading it to `Trustworthy`.
  * Support for GHC 8
  * Support for `transformers` 0.5

  1.3.3
  -----
  * Add `instance Monoid m => Divisible (Const m)`

  1.3.2
  -----
  * Add `($<)` operator

  1.3.1.1
  -------
  * Fixed builds on GHC 7.2

  1.3.1
  -----
  * Added `Data.Functor.Contravariant.Generic` on GHC 7.4+

  1.3
  ---
  * We've merged the `foreign-var` and `StateVar` packages. Transferring support to `StateVar`.

  1.2.2.1
  -------
  * Fixed redundant import warnings on GHC 7.10.

  1.2.2
  -----
  * Added `foreign-var` support.

  1.2.1
  -----
  * Added `phantom` to `Data.Functor.Contravariant`. This combinator was formerly called `coerce` in the `lens` package, but
    GHC 7.8 added a `coerce` method to base with a different meaning.
  * Added an unsupported `-f-semigroups` build flag that disables support for the `semigroups` package.
  * Minor documentation improvements.

  1.2.0.1
  -----
  * Fix build on GHC 7.0.4

  1.2
  -----
  * Renamed `Data.Functor.Contravariant.Applicative` to `Data.Functor.Contravariant.Divisible`

  1.1.1
  -----
  * Added `Data.Functor.Contravariant.Applicative`

  1.0
  ---
  * Removed `Day` convolution. The right adjoint of Day convolution is in `kan-extensions` as the right Kan lift. Moving these there to avoid forcing orphan instances. It also rather dramatically reduces the number of extensions required.
  * This requires a first digit bump as it breaks several of my own packages.

  0.6.1.1
  -------
  * Fixed issue with needing `KindSignatures` on older GHCs

  0.6.1
  -----
  * Added covariant `Day` convolution. It isn't contravariant, but it is inspired by the contravariant construction.

  0.5.1
  -----
  * `transformers` 0.4 compatibility

  0.5
  ---
  * Added `(>$)`
  * Added instances for `GHC.Generics`

  0.4.4
  -----
  * Fixed compatibility with GHC 7.7 and tightened `Safe` Haskell support.

  0.4.1
  -----
  * Added `Day` convolution under `Data.Functor.Contravariant.Day`.

  0.3
  ---
  * Added `Backwards` and `Reverse` instances for `transformers` 0.3
  * Added `instance (Functor f, Contravariant g) => Contravariant (Compose f g)`. (This is non-canonical, but is necessary to support other packages.)
  * Added `Functor` instances to `ComposeFC` and `ComposeCF` for use when modeling phantom type parameters caused mixing `Functor` + `Contravariant`.
