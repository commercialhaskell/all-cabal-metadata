  Dedication\n\n> Failure should be our teacher, not our undertaker. Failure is delay,
  not\n> defeat. It is a temporary detour, not a dead end. Failure is something we
  can\n> avoid only by saying nothing, doing nothing, and being nothing.\n>\n> Denis

  LANGUAGE FlexibleConstraints #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE
  TypeApplications    #-}\n{-# OPTIONS_GHC -fplugin=Data.Constraint.Emerge.Plugin
  #-}\n\nmodule Test where\n\nimport Data.Constraint.Emerge\n\nshowAnything :: forall
  c. Emerge (Show c) => c -> String\nshowAnything c =\n  case emerge @(Show c) of\n
  \   Just Dict -> show c\n    Nothing -> \"<<unshowable>>\"\n\n\nshowBool = showAnything
  True  -- \"True\"\nshowId   = showAnything id    -- \"<<unshowable>>\"\n```\n\n\n##
  Known Bugs\n\n* `constraints-emerge` will generate type-equality dictionaries any
  types (even\n    ones that aren't equal :scream: :scream: :scream:)\n* It fails
  to provide `Emerge c` dictionaries at runtime.\n* The generated error messages mention
  mangled type variables; it would be cool\n    if they didn't.\n\nIf someone wants
  to pick it up from here, that’d be great!\n\n\n## Related Work\n\n * [union-constraints](https://github.com/rampion/constraint-unions)\n
