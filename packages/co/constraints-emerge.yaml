synopsis: Defer instance lookups until runtime
changelog: ! "# Revision history for constraints-emerge\n\n## 0.1.2 -- 2018-04-19\n\n*
  Significantly better dictionary generation; the plugin will now build\n    dictionaries
  that depend on subdicts.\n* Fixed a bug where dictionaries depending on subdicts
  would cause segfaults at\n    runtime.\n* The plugin will now refuse to discharge
  'Emerge c' constraints if 'c' is not\n    fully monomorphic.\n* The plugin will
  now fail to generate equality dicts, even for types that are,\n    in fact, equal.
  This is bad, but much less disastrous than the old behavior\n    which would generate
  dictionaries for non-equal types...\n\n## 0.1.1 -- 2018-04-18\n\n* Updated some
  misleading error messages.\n\n## 0.1 -- 2018-04-18\n\n* First version. Released
  on an unsuspecting world.\n"

  Known Bugs\n\n* `constraints-emerge` will generate type-equality dictionaries any
  types (even\n    ones that aren't equal :scream: :scream: :scream:)\n* It fails
  to provide `Emerge c` dictionaries at runtime.\n* The generated error messages mention
  mangled type variables; it would be cool\n    if they didn't.\n\nIf someone wants
  to pick it up from here, that’d be great!\n\n\n## Related Work\n\n * [union-constraints](https://github.com/rampion/constraint-unions)\n
