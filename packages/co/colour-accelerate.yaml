  =================


  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tmcdonell/colour-accelerate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tmcdonell/colour-accelerate)


  This package provides data types and operations for dealing with colours in

  Accelerate. For details on Accelerate, refer to the [main

  repository](https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate).



  Example: Blur

  -------------


  | Test image | sRGB | RGB |

  |:----------:|:----:|:---:|

  | ![Test image][blocks] | ![sRGB linear][blur_srgb] | ![RGB non-linear][blur_rgb]
  |


  The test image on the left is composed of blocks and bars of the primary and

  secondary colours, arranged so that each colour is juxtaposed next to all

  others, plus black and white.


  The image in the centre is created by blurring the original with a 9x9 Gaussian

  filter in the linear gamma sRGB space.


  The image on the right is created by blurring with the same 9x9 Gaussian filter

  in the standard non-linear RGB colour space. Note the dark regions separating

  red from green and cyan, and blue from red and green; purple lines separate cyan

  from red and magenta; green separates yellow from cyan. These regions are

  artefacts produced by mixing colours in the RGB colour space.


  The files to generate the test image and run the demonstration are in the

  examples directory.
