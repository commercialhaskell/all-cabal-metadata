description: This provides polymorphic implimentations for filter, compact (catMaybes),
  and separate. It allows for higher performance implimentations to be used in place
  of defaults for all data structures, and endeavors to centerally document those
  implimentations. Compactable aims to be as general and unconstrained as possible,
  providing instances for non-Functors like Set, as well as some Contravariants (though
  not published here). Compactable fully subsumes Data.Witherable, offers more laws,
  and is more general.
