description: ! 'convertible provides a typeclass with a single function

  that is designed to help convert between different types: numeric

  values, dates and times, and the like.  The conversions perform bounds

  checking and return a pure Either value.  This means that you need

  not remember which specific function performs the conversion you

  desire.


  Also included in the package are optional instances that provide

  conversion for various numeric and time types, as well as utilities

  for writing your own instances.


  Finally, there is a function that will raise an exception on

  bounds-checking violation, or return a bare value otherwise,

  implemented in terms of the safer function described above.


  Convertible is also used by HDBC 2.0 for handling marshalling of

  data to and from databases.


  Convertible is backed by an extensive test suite and passes tests

  on GHC and Hugs.'
