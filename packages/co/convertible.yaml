description: |-
  convertible provides a typeclass with a single function
  that is designed to help convert between different types: numeric
  values, dates and times, and the like.  The conversions perform bounds
  checking and return a pure Either value.  This means that you need
  not remember which specific function performs the conversion you
  desire.

  Also included in the package are optional instances that provide
  conversion for various numeric and time types, as well as utilities
  for writing your own instances.

  Finally, there is a function that will raise an exception on
  bounds-checking violation, or return a bare value otherwise,
  implemented in terms of the safer function described above.

  Convertible is also used by HDBC 2.0 for handling marshalling of
  data to and from databases.

  Convertible is backed by an extensive test suite and passes tests
  on GHC and Hugs.
