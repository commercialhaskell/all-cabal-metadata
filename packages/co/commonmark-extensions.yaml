  # Changelog for commonmark-extensions

  ## 0.2.6

    * Track wikilinks with a class instead of the title (Evan
      Silberman). The use of title="wikilink" in HTML output traces
      back to Pandoc's hijacking of the title attribute for this purpose
      back when Pandoc links didn't have Attrs. A coordinated change in
      Pandoc moves this more appropriately into a class.

  ## 0.2.5.6

    * Autolink parser: track balanced brackets in path (improves
      on #156). We still get a link within a link, which isn't right, but at
      least the link goes to the right place. Cf. jgm/pandoc#10333.

  ## 0.2.5.5

    * Fix auto_identifiers extension: it now replaces emojis with
      their aliases, as documented.
    * Fix auto_identifiers_ascii extension: it now ignores
      non-ASCII characters with no ASCII equivalent.

  ## 0.2.5.4

    * Fix autolink parsing regression (#151). This affects autolinks with
      doubled internal line-ending punctuation characters.

  ## 0.2.5.3

    * Fix rebase_relative_paths extension so it works with URLs with
      non-ASCII characters (#148). Previously these would not be properly
      detected as absolute URIs.

  ## 0.2.5.2

    * Improve autolinks extension (#147).
      The autolinks extension was interacting badly with explicit links,
      To fix this we had to make autolink parsing a bit stricter than
      the GFM spec does.  They allow unbalanced `)` except at the end
      of a URL (which is defined as: followed by optional final punctuation
      then whitespace or eof).  With this change, we don't allow unbalanced
      `)` at all in raw URLs. This should not be a big problem in practice.

    * Protect against quadratic generated table size explosion (Michael Howell).
      This commit adds a limit to the number of auto-completed cells
      around 200,000. The result is, in these original samples:

  ## 0.2.5.1

    * Add `test/alerts.md` to extra-source-files in cabal file.

  ## 0.2.5

    * Add support for alerts extension, supporting GitHub-style alerts (#132).
      <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts>
      New module Commonmark.Extensions.Alerts [API change].

    * Do not accept footnote labels with line breaks (Michael Howell).

    * Parse `[^ ]` and `[^]` as links (Michael Howell). This is consistent with
      most other CommonMark parsers, even when they have support for footnotes turned on.

  ## 0.2.4

    * Make `pipe_tables` extension treat backslash escapes like GH does (#112,
      Michael Howell). This change essentially changes the way the text
      `\\|` gets parsed inside a table. In the old version, the first backslash
      escapes the second backslash, and then the pipe is treated as a cell
      separator. In the new version, the pipe is still preceded by a backslash,
      so it is still literal text. The escaping rule is documented in detail
      in the spec for this extension. This change also aligns our escaping
      of pipes with GitHub's.

  ## 0.2.3.6

    * Fix pipe table parser so that `|`s don't interfere with
      other block structures (Michael Howell, #111, fixing #52 and
      #95). This parser is structured as a system that parses the
      *second* line first, then parses the first line. That is, if
      it detects a delimiter row as the second line of a
      paragraph, it converts the paragraph into a table. This
      seems counterintuitive, but it works better than trying to
      convert a table into a paragraph, since it might need to be
      something else.

    * Improve parsing of inline math (#110).

  ## 0.2.3.5

    - Resolve entities inside wikilinks (#105, Michał Kukieła).

  ## 0.2.3.4

    - Require whitespace after definition list marker (#104).
      Otherwise we can inadvertently clobber strikeout or subscript.

  ## 0.2.3.3

    - Fix definition_lists extension (#96). We were not properly consuming
      indentation in definitions, which caused problems when the definitions
      themselves contained lists.

  ## 0.2.3.2

  - Update lower version bounds for commonmark (#93, David
    Thrane Christiansen).

  ## 0.2.3.1

  - `math` extension:  don't fail when display math contains
    embedded inline math.  See jgm/pandoc#7942.
  - Make math parsing more sophisticated.
    Count embeddings inside `{..}`, since math can contain
    e.g. `\text{...}` which itself contains math delimiters.
  - Small improvement in pipe table parsing.
    The old parser failed on some edge cases with extra whitespace
    after pipes (which we should just ignore).
  - `fancy_list` extension: improve list type ambiguity resolution (#89).

  ## 0.2.3

  - Allow bare word attribute in fenced_divs (#84).  This follows a similar
    change in pandoc (jgm/pandoc#7242).

  ## 0.2.2.1

  - Fix commonmark-extensions to build with GHC 9.2 (#81, Joseph C. Sible).
    Currently `--allow-newer` is needed.

  ## 0.2.2

  - Add footnote to gfmExtensions.  Note that this also requires
    additional type constraints on gfmExtensions [API change].

  ## 0.2.1.2

  - Fix bug with absolute paths in rebase_relative_paths
    extension on Windows.

  ## 0.2.1.1

  - Fix bug in wikilinks extensions.

  ## 0.2.1

  - Add `rebase_relative_paths` extension.
    New exported module Commonmark.Extensions.RebaseRelativePaths [API change].
  - Add `wikilinks_title_before_pipe` and `wikilinks_title_after_pipe`
    extensions (#69).
    New exported module Commonmark.Extensions.Wikilinks [API change].

  ## 0.2.0.4

  - Add a test for autolinks (#66).
  - Require commonmark 0.1.1.2 (otherwise autolinks don't work
    properly).

  ## 0.2.0.3

  - Add some new test examples to the autolinks extension spec (#65).
  - Allow interior `~` characters in autolinks (#65).

  ## 0.2.0.2

  - Remove unnecessary Typeable constraint on `TaskList` and
    `gfmExtensions` (#58).

  - Fix bug in `footnote` extension:  multiple blocks in
    a block container (e.g. block quote or list) inside
    a footnote were being rendered in reverse order (#63,
    Harald Gliebe).

  ## 0.2.0.1

  - Added a missing test file to extra-source-files (#55).

  ## 0.2.0.0

  - Add HasQuoted class in Smart extension, with singleQuoted
    and doubleQuoted methods.  This gives more fleibility in
    supporting smart quotes, and allows us to use pandoc's
    Quoted elements.

  - Add advice to haddocks for pipeTableSpec (#52).
    If a line could be a candidate pipe table heading, but the
    following line of separators is not encountered, the line is
    treated as a paragraph, even if it has indications of other
    block-level formatting.  Putting the pipeTableSpec AFTER
    parsers for lists, headings, etc. causes the latter to take
    priority.
