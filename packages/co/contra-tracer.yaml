  # contra-tracer

  Logging and monitoring should be treated as a software feature and not just a
  debugging tool.
  Yet it's common to find logging definitions which use monads and typeclasses
  to do what is essentially printf debugging: the log items are big types like
  text or JSON, and these items may be logged any where, any time, because the
  logging implementation is part of some omnipresent application monad.

  This package provides a minimal set of definitions for _contravariant tracing_.
  It is intended to express the pattern--found in logging and monitoring--in which
  domain-specific values (e.g. events, statistics) are provided to
  domain-agnostic processors (e.g. syslog). A program which has a `Tracer m t` in
  scope is able to log any `t` with side-effects in `m`. By choosing `t` to be as
  small as possible, the program becomes more modular, because a tracer on a
  bigger type is also a tracer on a smaller type:

  ```Haskell
  -- This is from Data.Functor.Contravariant
  -- (t -> s) shows that s is bigger than t
  contramap :: (t -> s) -> Tracer m s -> Tracer m t
  ```

  The `Contravariant` instance on `Tracer m` is the mechanism by which a
  domain-agnostic tracer is adapted to stand in where a domain-specific
  tracer is required. This is why we call it contravariant tracing.

  ```Haskell
  -- Puts text to stdout.
  stdoutTracer :: Tracer IO Text

  -- A somain-specific event type.
  data Event = EventA | EventB Int

  -- The log format for an Event.
  eventToText :: Event -> Text

  -- The stdoutTracer becomes an Event tracer by way of the Contravariant
  -- instance.
  eventTracer :: Tracer IO Event
  eventTracer = contramap eventToText stdoutTracer
  ```

  This style is intended to discourage the use of very big types like text or JSON
  within programs which do logging. When expressed in this style, such a program
  will not even have the possibility of doing the printf debugging style referred
  to in the opening paragraph, because there is no `Tracer m Text` in scope!

  ```Haskell
  -- Some action that can use any tracer on Event in IO.
  -- It does not need to be able to log text in order to run.
  action :: Tracer IO Event -> IO Int
  action tracer = do
    traceWith tracer EventA
    stuff <- doSomething
    traceWith tracer (EventB 42)
    pure stuff

  main :: IO ()
  main = do
    _ <- action eventTracer
    pure ()
  ```

  ## Arrow tracers

  The contravariant tracer is defined in terms of the arrow tracer found in the
  module `Control.Tracer.Arrow`. The motivation for the arrow tracer is to
  encourage the programmer to throw in `traceWith` calls liberally, and leave
  them in so that they will not bit-rot, with the understanding that there will
  be no runtime overhead if tracing is disabled. This module is only relevant when
  dealing with a tracer which will ignore certain inputs but not others. With the
  arrow representation, it is often possible to judge that a tracer will not emit
  anything, without forcing the input, so that the `traceWith` call becomes a
  no-op.
