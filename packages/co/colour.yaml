description: "I hope for this library to become the standard colour library for Haskell.\nMost
  software does not properly blend colours because they fail to\ngamma-correct the
  colours before blending.  Hopefully by using this library,\nHaskell programs dealing
  with colour blending will avoid this problem.\n\nThere are some optimizing RULES
  pragmas that could be added to improve\npreformance.  If you are having performace
  issues with colour, please\nlet me know, and we will test some of these pragmas.\n\nBug
  reports and any patches are also welcome.  Be warned, I haven't\nextensively tested
  this library yet.\n\n-- \nRussell O'Connor <roconnor@theorem.ca>"
