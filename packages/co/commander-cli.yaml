  # Commander CLI

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/commander-cli.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/commander-cli)
  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SamuelSchlesinger/commander-cli.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SamuelSchlesinger/commander-cli)

  This library is meant to allow Haskell programs to quickly and easily construct
  command line interfaces which are easy to use, especially as a Haskell user. To
  begin, I suggest viewing the task-manager application which comes with this
  repository. The library is based around the following classes:

  ```haskell
  class Unrender r where
    unrender :: Text -> Maybe r
  ```

  This class is what you will use to define the parsing of a type from text and
  can use any parsing library or whatever you want. Next, we have the class

  ```haskell
  class HasProgram p where
    data ProgramT p m a
    run :: ProgramT p IO a -> CommanderT State IO a
    hoist :: (forall x. m x -> n x) -> ProgramT p m a -> ProgramT p n a
    invocations :: [Text]
  ```

  Instances of this class will define a syntactic element, a new instance of the
  data family ProgramT, as well as its semantics in terms of the CommanderT monad,
  which is a backtracking monad based on a metaphor to military commanders which
  retreats upon defeat.
