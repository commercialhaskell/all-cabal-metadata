description: |-
  Solver for the numbers round of the Countdown game show:

  * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show)>

  * <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfa3MHLLSWI>

  That is, given six numbers and a target number,
  find an arithmetical expression containing exactly those six numbers
  that yields the target number.
  The solver however is neither limited to a certain number of operands
  nor to a certain magnitude of numbers
  nor to uniqueness of the operands.
  Please note, that the solver also emits solutions
  where not all of the given operands are used.

  Example:

  > $ countdown-numbers-solve 23 42 3 4 5 --result 777
  > (23*3+5)*42/4

  The solver employs a brute-force search,
  but ensures that expressions are unique up to commutativity and associativity.
  It determines all solutions of a problem within seconds.
