description: |-
  This is part of a library to help build command-line programs, both tools and
  longer-running daemons.

  This package adds wrappers around the __effectful__ library, providing an
  implmentation of a ProgramE τ effect wrapping the Program τ monad from
  __core-program__ so that applications needing to use a complicated effect
  system can still access top-level program utilities such as concurrency,
  logging, and telemetry.
