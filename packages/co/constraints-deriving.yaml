description: "[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/constraints-deriving.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/constraints-deriving)\n[![Build
  Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/achirkin/constraints-deriving.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/achirkin/constraints-deriving)\n#
  constraints-deriving\n\nThis project is based on the [constraints](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/constraints)
  library.\nModule `Data.Constraint.Deriving` is a GHC Core compiler plugin that\nprovides
  new flexible programmable ways to generate class instances.\n\nThe main goal of
  this project is to make possible a sort of ad-hoc polymorphism that I wanted to\nimplement
  in [easytensor](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/easytensor) for performance reasons:\nan
  umbrella type unifies multiple specialized type family backend instances;\nif the
  type instance is known, GHC picks a specialized (overlapping) class instance for
  a required function;\notherwise, GHC resorts to a unified (overlappable) instance
  that is defined for the whole type family.\n\nTo use the plugin, add\n```Haskell\n{-#
  OPTIONS_GHC -fplugin Data.Constraint.Deriving #-}\n```\nto the header of your module.\nFor
  debugging, add a plugin option `dump-instances`:\n```Haskell\n{-# OPTIONS_GHC -fplugin-opt
  Data.Constraint.Deriving:dump-instances #-}\n```\nto the header of your file; it
  will print all instances declared in the module (hand-written and auto-generated).\nTo
  enable much more verbose debug output, use library flag `dev` (for debugging the
  plugin itself).\n\nCheck out `example` folder for a motivating use case (enabled
  with flag `examples`).\n\nThe plugin is controlled via GHC annotations; there are
  three types of annotations corresponding to plugin passes.\nAll passes are core-to-core,
  which means the plugin runs after the typechecker,\nwhich in turn means **the generated
  class instances are available only outside of the module**.\nA sort of inconvenience
  you may have experienced with template haskell \U0001F609.\n\n### DeriveAll\n\n`DeriveAll`
  plugin pass inspects a newtype declaration.\nTo enable `DeriveAll` for a newtype
  `Foo`, add an annotation as follows:\n```Haskell\ndata Bar a = ...\n{-# ANN type
  Foo DeriveAll #-}\nnewtype Foo a = Foo (Bar a)\n\n-- the result is that Foo has
  the same set of instances as Bar\n```\ncheck out [`test/Spec/`](https://github.com/achirkin/constraints-deriving/tree/master/test/Spec)
  for [more examples](https://github.com/achirkin/constraints-deriving/blob/master/test/Spec/DeriveAll04.hs#L19-L20).\n\n`DeriveAll`
  plugin pass looks through all possible type instances (in the presence of type families)
  of the base type,\nand copies all class instances for the newtype wrapper.\n\nSometimes,
  you may need to refine the relation between the base type and the newtype;\nyou
  can do this via a special `type family DeriveContext newtype :: Constraint`.\nBy
  adding equality constraints, you can specify custom dependencies between type variables
  present in the newtype declaration\n(e.g. [`test/Spec/DeriveAll01.hs`](https://github.com/achirkin/constraints-deriving/blob/master/test/Spec/DeriveAll01.hs#L24)).\nBy
  adding class constraints, you force these class constraints for all generated class
  instances\n(e.g. in [`test/Spec/DeriveAll02.hs`](https://github.com/achirkin/constraints-deriving/blob/master/test/Spec/DeriveAll02.hs#L37)\n
  all class instances of `BazTy a b c d e f` have an additional constraint `Show e`).\n\n\nNote,
  the internal machinery is different from `GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving` approach:\nrather
  than coercing every function in the instance definition from the base type to the
  newtype,\nit coerces the whole instance dictionary.\n\n#### Blacklisting instances
  from being DeriveAll-ed\n\nSometimes you may want to avoid deriving a number of
  instances for your newtype.\nUse `DeriveAllBut [String]` constructor in the annotation
  and specify names of type classes you don't want to derive.\n```Haskell\n{-# ANN
  type CHF (DeriveAllBut [\"Show\"]) #-}\nnewtype CHF = CHF Double deriving Show\n\n--
  the result is a normal `Show CHF` instance and the rest of `Double`'s instances
  are DeriveAll-ed\n```\nFor your safety,\nthe plugin is hardcoded to **not** generate
  instances for any classes and types in\n`GHC.Generics`, `Data.Data`, `Data.Typeable`,
  `Language.Haskell.TH`.\n\n#### Overlapping instances\n\nBy default `DeriveAll` marks
  all instances as `NoOverlap` if there are no overlapping\nclosed type families involved.\nOtherwise,
  it marks overlapped type instances as `Incoherent`.\nIf this logic does not suit
  you, you can enforce `OverlapMode` using `DeriveAll'` data constructor.\n\n### ToInstance\n\n`ToInstance`
  plugin pass converts a top-level `Ctx => Dict (Class t1..tn)` value declaration
  into\nan instance of the form `instance Ctx => Class t1..tn`.\nThus, one can write
  arbitrary Haskell code (returning a class dictionary) to be executed every time\nan
  instance is looked up by the GHC machinery.\nTo derive an instance this way, use
  \ `ToInstance (x :: OverlapMode)` for a declaration, e.g. as follows:\n```Haskell\nnewtype
  Foo t = Foo t\n\n{-# ANN deriveEq (ToInstance NoOverlap) #-}\nderiveEq :: Eq t =>
  Dict (Eq (Foo t))\nderiveEq = mapDict (unsafeDerive Foo) Dict\n\n-- the result of
  the above is equal to\n-- deriving instance Eq t => Eq (Foo t)\n```\nYou can find
  a more meaningful example in [`test/Spec/ToInstance01.hs`](https://github.com/achirkin/constraints-deriving/blob/master/test/Spec/ToInstance01.hs#L45-L47)
  or\n[`example/Lib/VecBackend.hs`](https://github.com/achirkin/constraints-deriving/blob/master/example/Lib/VecBackend.hs).\n\n**Danger**:
  `ToInstance` removes duplicate instances;\nif you have defined an instance with
  the same head using vanilla Haskell and the plugin,\nthe latter will try to replace
  the former in place.\nBehavior of the instance in the same module is undefined in
  this case\n(the other modules should be fine seeing the plugin version).\n*I used
  this trick to convince `.hs-boot` to see the instances generated by the plugin.*\n\n\n###
  ClassDict\n\n`ClassDict` plugin pass lets you construct a new class dictionary without\nactually
  creating a class instance:\n```Haskell\n{-# ANN defineEq ClassDict #-}\ndefineEq
  :: (a -> a -> Bool) -> (a -> a -> Bool) -> Dict (Eq a)\ndefineEq = defineEq\n--
  the plugin replaces the above line with an actual class data constructor application\n```\nCheck
  out [`test/Spec/ClassDict01.hs`](https://github.com/achirkin/constraints-deriving/blob/master/test/Spec/ClassDict01.hs)
  for a more elaborate example.\n\n## Further work\n\n`DeriveAll` derivation mechanics
  currently ignores and may break functional dependencies.\n"
