  Conf: Parser for Haskell-based configuration files.
  ===========

  Installation
  -----------
  You can install this library from Hackage via `cabal install conf`

  Description
  -----------

  This package is designed to allow you to create configuration files
  with declarative Haskell and parse the values back into Haskell code.
  The benefit here is to have a configuration file in Haskell that does
  not have to be recompiled - it is interpreted/parsed at runtime in a
  type-safe manner.

  Example usage:

  ```haskell
  -- /path/to/my-config.hs
  foo = ["bar", "baz"]
  spam = Eggs
  ```

  ```haskell
  -- Application source
  import Data.Conf
  import Data.Maybe

  data Spam = Eggs | Parrot | SomethingEntirelyDifferent
      deriving (Show, Read)

  getSpam :: Conf -> Spam
  getSpam = fromMaybe SomethingEntirelyDifferent . getConf "spam"

  getFoo :: Conf -> Maybe Int
  getFoo = getConf "foo"

  main = do
      conf <- readConf "my-config.hs"
      print $ getSpam conf -- Output: Eggs
      print $ getFoo conf  -- Output: Nothing
  ```

  Building
  --------
  ```bash
  cabal sandbox init  # If you haven't already
  cabal install -j --dependencies-only
  cabal build
  ```

  Running the Tests
  -----------------
  ```bash
  cabal sandbox init  # If you haven't already
  cabal install -j --enable-tests --dependencies-only
  cabal test
  ```
