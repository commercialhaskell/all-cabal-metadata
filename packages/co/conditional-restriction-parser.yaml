description: "# Conditional Restriction Parser\n\nThis project includes a library
  that can be used to handle [OSM Conditional Restrictions]()\nas well as a console-based
  application\nthat can be used for simple parsing and evaluation of conditional restrictions.\n\nBoth
  the library and the application are implemented in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/),\nusing
  [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).\nYou can find the library
  code under `src/` and the application code under `app/`.\n\nThe library is designed
  to work with conditional restrictions as\n[documented on 14. April 2022 on the OSM
  Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/index.php?title=Conditional_restrictions&oldid=2310830).\nConditional
  restrictions also support OSM Opening Hours, for which only a subset\nhas been implemented
  in this project. The versions used are\n[Key:opening_hours on 10. April 2022](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/index.php?title=Key:opening_hours&oldid=2309608)\nand
  [Key:opening_hours/specification on 04. November 2021](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/index.php?title=Key:opening_hours/specification&oldid=2215648).\n\n##
  Compiling the project\n\nTo compile the current state of the project, you'll need
  a working [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)\nsetup and a
  working [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) setup. The easiest way to set those
  both up is\nprobably with the [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) tool.\n\nFollowing
  versions have been found to be working for this project:\n- GHCup v0.1.17.7 (newer
  probably possible)\n- Stack v2.7.5 (newer probably possible)\n- GHC v9.0.2 (should
  match your installation)\n\nThe build has only been tested on (Manjaro) Linux, but
  other operating systems\nshould work, as long as this setup is present. All you
  need to do in order to\ncompile the library and the application is to execute\n\n```
  sh\nstack build\n```\n\non a shell of your choice (Stack needs to be in your\n[$PATH](https://linuxconfig.org/linux-path-environment-variable))
  in the project\nfolder. Stack will output something like this:\n\n```\nInstalling
  library in /home/user/workspace/conditional-restriction-parser/.stack-work/install/x86_64-linux-tinfo6/577aef19c282e0a36f2ce11fb38f5391ea06983467b015a6bfb319f9dd99acfe/9.0.2/lib/x86_64-linux-ghc-9.0.2/conditional-restriction-parser-0.1.0-45ZsUYVvY6oL6ghNWUuJIJ\nInstalling
  executable conditional-restriction-parser-exe in /home/user/workspace/conditional-restriction-parser/.stack-work/install/x86_64-linux-tinfo6/577aef19c282e0a36f2ce11fb38f5391ea06983467b015a6bfb319f9dd99acfe/9.0.2/bin\nRegistering
  library for conditional-restriction-parser-0.1.0..\n```\n\nFrom which you can see
  where the built library and where the built application\nwas stored. If you want
  to install the application in your $PATH, you can\nexecute\n\n``` sh\nstack install\n```\n\nwhich
  will install the built application in a dedicated directory. The executable will
  be named `conditional-restriction-parser-exe`.\n\n## Developer Setup\n\nIf you want
  to develop new features or fix a bug, you'll need to set up a\ndevelopement environment.
  First, follow the steps for [compiling the\nproject](#compiling-the-project). Any
  IDE that supports Haskell\nworks, but this project has been developed with [Doom\nEmacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs),\n[LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)\nand
  [HLS](https://haskell-language-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what-is-hls.html)
  version 1.6.1.0.\nPlease use [Ormolu](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu) for formatting
  your code if you want\nto contribute your code to the project, this will guarantee
  consistent style.\n\nExecute unit tests and integration tests using\n\n```sh\nstack
  test\n```\n\nin the project folder. If you want to check the test coverage, use\n\n```
  sh\nstack test --coverage\nstack hpc report .\n```\n\n## License \n\nThis project
