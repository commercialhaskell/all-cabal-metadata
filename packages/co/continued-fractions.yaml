  0.10.0.2
  =====
  * Update link Travis CI build information in README from `travis-ci.org` to
    `travis-ci.com` because of [this recent change](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2018-05-02-open-source-projects-on-travis-ci-com-with-github-apps).

  0.10.0.1
  =====
  * Remove unqualified imports from test module.
  * Add README and CHANGES files to `extra-source-files` field in `.cabal` file.
  * Add `bug-reports` field to `.cabal` file.

  0.10.0.0
  =====

  * Temporarily move project's repository from [mokus0](https://github.com/mokus0/continued-fractions) to
    [rockbmb](https://github.com/rockbmb/continued-fractions). This was a duplication, not a fork, so
    users can create issues in the latter repository as well.
  * Enable Travis CI to run tests for each build for the project's new repository.
  * Increase lower bound for the Cabal version to be used when compiling this
    project from `>=1.6` to `>=1.10`.
  * Change the supported GHC versions from the interval [7.0.4 .. 7.11] to
    [8.0.2 .. 8.6.1].

  Continued Fractions
  =========

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/rockbmb/continued-fractions.svg)](https://travis-ci.com/rockbmb/continued-fractions)

  `continued-fractions` is a Haskell library for manipulating and evaluating continued
  fractions.

  To use this library, the following information is relevant:

  * The `CF` datatype is defined thusly:
  ```haskell
  data CF a = CF a [a]
            | GCF a [(a,a)]
  ```
    where the `CF` constructor is used to represent continued fractions whose numerators
    are all `1`, and `GCF` represents generalized continued fractions. These constructors
    are not exported.

  * The `cf :: a -> [a] -> CF a` function is used to create continued fractions.

  * The `gcf :: a -> [(a,a)] -> CF a` function is used to create generalized continued
    fractions.
