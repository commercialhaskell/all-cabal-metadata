description: |-
  A data structure to store small vectors of small integers
  with minimal memory overhead. For example the (word) vector
  corresponding to [1..14] only takes 16 bytes (2 machine
  words on 64 bit architectures) of heap memory.
  See the module "Data.Vector.Compact.WordVec" for more
  details.
