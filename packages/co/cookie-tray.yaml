description: |
  The `cookie-tray` package aims to make it easy to set cookies from your web
  server, even if you are not intimately familiar with the details of the
  `Set-Cookie` HTTP field.

  One example of a higher-level abstraction provided by this library is the idea
  of cookie deletion. The low-level specification gives no way to explicitly
  instruct a client to unset a cookie. This library provides a `Delete` action
  that does the right thing (sets the cookie with an expiration date in the past)
  to achieve removal.

  ---

  Currently the best way to see how the library is used is to look at the test
  suite.

  ---

  I currently consider the API to be "experimental" because I don't think its
  chief goals of being convenient and instructive have been satisfied confidently
  enough to consider the library "finished." I am open to accepting improvements
  to make the library more convenient to use.

  ---

  This package works nicely in conjunction with [wai] and [warp]. See
  [mapResponseHeaders] in WAI for how to apply fields to the response header.

  I am not sure how one would use this with [scotty], as you may be thwarted by
  Scotty's use of `Text` instead of `ByteString` to represent HTTP fields.
