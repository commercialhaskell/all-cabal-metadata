  co-log-json\n\n`co-log-json` allows writing structured logs in your application.\n\nThe
  library allows adding additional machine-readable context to the log\nmessages.
  I.e. each log message is a JSON object with a predefined structure\nwhere additional
  user context can be added. Such logs can be easily indexed\nby external logs systems
  such as [Graylog](https://www.graylog.org) or \n[Elastic search](https://www.elastic.co).
  The message logging is done using\na special context, that keeps the information
  about additional attributes.\nSuch contexts form a nested scope, and all messages
  in the score inherit provided\ncontext:\n\n```\n   scope [ user = \"Joe\"] \n     |\n
  \    | ==>  {\"message\":\"user arrived\", \"data\": { \"user\": \"Joe\"}\n     |\n
  \    +------ scope [ tag = \"human\" ]\n              |\n              | ==> {\"message\":
  \"user entered the door\", \"data\": { \"user\": \"Joe\", \"tag\": \"human\"}\n```\n\n\nIn
  other words, this library takes two choices:\n\n  1. We write full context with
  each message.\n  This approach allows using external tools (like elastic-search)
  that can index message\n  without any additional work and information.\n  Any message
  can be lost without affecting the ability to decode other messages. An alternative\n
  \ approach could be emitting a list of events (possibly as a bytecode), such an
  approach\n  is taken by the tracing libraries. It requires more works during reading
  and indexing\n  logs, and in the case in some logs are logs may render later ones
  unusable or lose some info.\n\n  2. We keep a state context so we don't need to
  attach context messages to each one.\n  An alternative approach is the extraction
  of the structure information from the message itself.\n  This approach is taken
  in some structured logging libraries, it can provide better error\n  messages. However,
  it requires to think about the message context all the time (and developer \n  user
  may not even know all interesting context where the message will be used).\n\n\n#
  Using a library\n\nTo to use a library you'll need to add `co-log-json` to the dependency
  list.\n\n```\nlibrary.cabal\n\nlibrary\n  build-depends:\n    base,\n    co-log-json
  ^>= 0.0\n```\n\n\n## Setting the library\n\n\n```haskell\nimport Colog.Json                       --
  Core API for structured logging\nimport Colog.Json.Action (logToHandle)  -- Actions
  to store the message\nimport System.IO (stderr)\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n  --
  First, we need to set up log storing function:\n  --   To emit logs we need to create
  a context.\n  --    Context takes the action to store log and it's possible to\n
  \ --    attach additional information to it.\n\n  let context = mkLogger (logToHandle
  stderr)\n  --                          ^\n  --                          |\n  --
  \                         +------  `LogAction IO Message` \n  --                                    (see
  discussion \"Why IO below\")\n  --\n  -- Once 'context' is created it can be passed
  to the other parts\n  -- of the code or used to emit logs.\n\n  logDebug context
  \"Hi, there!\"\n  --         ^         ^\n  --         |         |\n  --         |
  \        +----- `LogStr` type - is an efficient text builder.\n  --         |                 \n
  \ --         |\n  --         +-- log context\n\n  -- Will output:\n  --\n  -- ```\n
  \ -- {\"severity\":\"DEBUG\", \"thread\": 1, \"message\": \"Hi, there!\"}\n  --
  ```\n  --                ^               ^                ^\n  --                |
  \              |                +------------ Message itself\n  --                |
  \              +----------------------------- Id of the thread that emitted the
  message\n  --                +----------------- Severity level: Debug, Info, Notice,
  Error, Critical, Alert, Emergency\n  -- \n  -- to the stderr.\n\n  -- There are
  other helper functions list `logInfo`, `logNotice`, etc.\n```\n\nNow let's discuss
  `LogStr` type. It exists to efficiently generate message without\nextra allocations
  that can be avoided. It's just a [Text.Builder](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-1.2.4.0/docs/Data-Text-Lazy-Builder.html)
  though internal\nrepresentation may evolve in the future. `LogStr` allows message
  concatenation without allocating\nintermediate structures, so it allows efficient
  log building. For example line:\n\n```haskell\n  logDebug context $ \"a\" <> \"b\"
  <> \"c\"\n```\n\nwill write all text string \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" directly to the
  buffer, and can do more optimizations.\nSo it's quite safe to use the library even
  with a large number of logs.\n\nThe 'LogStr' type implement [IsString](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/Data-String.html#t:IsString)
  instance it means that you can just write string literals\nand they will be treated
  as 'LogStr'. To concatenate two 'LogStr' you can use [`<>`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/Data-Semigroup.html#t:Semigroup)
  operation.\n\nIn addition you can convert any string lines that has [StringConv
  a T.Text](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/string-conv-0.1.2/docs/Data-String-Conv.html),
  i.e. can be converted\nto LogStr using `ls :: StringConv a T.Text => a -> LogStr`.\nEfficiency
  and safety of this conversion depends on the concrete instance implementation and
  is out\nof control of the package.\n\n```haskell\n   logDebug context $ \"foo is
  \" <> ls (\"ы\":: ByteString)\n```\n\nIn case your data structure does not implement
  `StringConv a` it's possible to use not efficient but\nvery general `showLS :: Show
  a => a -> LogStr` method that will work for any type that has Show instance.\n\n##
  Adding context.\n\nBut just writing JSON messages is not very interesting, we want
  to control the context of the message.\nIn order to add user data to the context
  we can use `addContext :: PushContext -> LoggerEnv -> LoggerEnv`\nmethod.\n\n```haskell\n\n
  \  let context1 = addContext (sl \"user_id\" (1::Int)) context\n   --    ^                    ^
  \    ^         ^        ^\n   --    |                    |     |         |        +---
  old context\n   --    |                    |     |         +------------ user data
  \n   --    |                    |     +---------------------- key for the user data\n
  \  --    |                    +---------------------------- function that generates
  an entry\n   --    +------------------------------------------------- new context
  that has data attached\n\n   logDebug context1 \"Hi again!\"\n\n   -- Will emit
  to the stderr:\n   --\n   -- ```\n   -- {\"severity\":\"DEBUG\", \"thread\": 1,
  \"message\": \"Hi, there!\", \"data\": {\"user_id\":1}}\n   -- ```\n   --                                                              ^
  \          ^    ^\n   --                                                              |
  \          |    +-- value\n   --                                                              |
  \          +------- key\n   --                                                              +---
  all user data is kept under 'data' key\n```\n\nSidenote: 'sl' function looks redundant,
  but it's needed in order to provide a future\ncompatibility for a case when internal
  structure of user data is changing. Historically\nit came from [katip](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/katip)
  library, there are more functions that allows context creation but\n\nFunction `sl
  :: ToJSON a => T.Text -> a -> PushContext` prepares update to the context. \nIt
  encodes user data to JSON. This is why we had to add type annotation to `1` otherwise
  GHC had\nno means to infer the type).\n\nIt's important that the library does not
  perform any compaction of key-values, i.e.:\n\n```haskell\n   logDebug (addContext
  (sl \"user_id\" 2) context1) \"Who am I?\"\n   -- Will emit:\n   -- ```\n   -- {\"severity\":\"DEBUG\",
  \"thread\": 1, \"message\": \"Hi, there!\", \"data\": {\"user_id\":1, \"user_id\":
  2}}\n   -- ```\n```\n\nThis is done for purpose, but may be a subject to change
  in the future major versions.\n\n`addContext` is not the only function that allows
  to modify context, there is the other one\n`addNamespace :: Text -> LoggerEnv ->
  LoggerEnv`, this function adds an entry about the \ncurrent namespace. Namespace
  is a nested list of strings that tells the logical part of \nthe codebase the log
  belongs to. It's kept separate fom the data, and it's possible to\nuse in library
  filtering (using  [cfilter](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/2018-09-25-co-log#cfilter))
  or filtering in external system.\n\n\nThe described functionality is enough to perform
  logging. However, it may worth discussing \ninteroperability with the rest of co-log
  ecosystem and ergonomics.\n\n## co-log interoperability\n\nThe co-log ecosystem
  works with \"LogAction m a\" and in the package, we use \"LogEnv\" it means\nthat
  we are losing most of the benefits of the library and can't use a lot of utility\nfunctions.
  To improve the situation it's possible to convert LogEnv into\n`LogAction m (Severity,LogStr)`
  using function `unLogger`. Then we will have log action\nthat will emit a message
  with the current context, but the context will no longer be modifiable.\n\n# Ergonomics\n\nThe
  package provides no ergonomic tools by default and it's important that `addContext`
  is a pure\nfunction. On the one han,d it introduces a log of boilerplate code but
  on the other.\n\nIt allows to modify context even outside of the effectful computation
  for example with servant you may have:\n\n```haskell\n-- | Catalogue of items \ndata
  CatalogueApi route = CatalogueApi\n  { _the_catalogue :: route :- Capture \"catalogue_id\"
  CatalogueId :> ToServantAPI Bar\n  , ...\n  } \n\n-- Item\ndata ItemApi route =
  ItemApi\n  { _items :: route :- \"items\" :> Get '[JSON] (Vector Item)\n  , ...\n
  \ }\n\nhandleCatalogue :: LoggerEnv -> ToServant CatalogueApi AsServer\nhandleCatalogue
  ctx' = CatalogueApi\n  { _the_catalogue = \\catalogue_id ->\n     handleItem (addContext
  \"catalogue_id\" catalogue_id) ctx) catalogue_id\n  , ...\n  }\n  where \n    ctx
  = addNamespace \"catalogue\" ctx'\n\nhandleItem :: LoggerEnv -> CatalogueId -> ToServant
  ItemApi AsServer\nhandleItem ctx' catalogue_id = ItemApi ...\n  where ctx = addNamespace
  \"item\" ctx'\n```\n\nSo we can build computation that we will execute later while
  modifying the context.\n\nOn the other hand, we can always wrap this pure function
  into an effect system \nof choice be it either handle pattern or readert or MTL
  or effect system.\nThis library does not target any particular solution and  want
  to introduce \nneither additional dependencies nor additional restrictions on the
  user.\n"
