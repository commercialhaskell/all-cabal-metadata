changelog: "# Changelog for `covenant`\n\nAll notable changes to this project will
  be documented in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).\n\n##
  UNRELEASED\n\n* Expose unsafe constructors `UnsafeMkId` and `UnsafeMkArg` for `Id`
  and `Arg`\n  respectively from `Covenant.Test`\n* Add read-only synonyms `Id` and
  `Arg` for the two data types with the same\n  name in `Covenant.ASG`\n* Modify `CovenantTypeError`
  for new catamorphism related errors\n* Rewrite `cata` to take explicit handlers
  for the base functor (similar to\n  `match`)\n\n## 1.3.0 -- 2025-10-07\n\n* Zipper
  for the ASG in `Covenant.Zipper`\n* `topLevelId` function in `Covenant.ASG`\n* Changed
  type name representation of base functors from a `_F` suffix to a `#` prefix. For
  example, the base functor for `List` is now named `#List` instead of `List_F`. \n*
  Changed base functor lookup machinery / representation to not require raw TyName
  text manipulation \n* Provided helper function for safe construction of base functor
  names from the parent TyName\n* `ASG` now exposes a read-only pattern synonym\n*
  `ValNodeInfo`'s pattern for `App` now exposes type applications as well\n* JSON
  serialization and deserialization support for `ASG`s with type\n  declarations\n*
  Removed `CaseData` and `CaseList`, as Plutus Core no longer supports them\n\n##
  1.2.0 -- 2025-08-27\n\n* Helper function for safely retrieving an in-scope type
  variable when constructing the ASG  \n* Removed Return nodes, associated pattern
  synonyms, and the `ret` ASGBuilder function\n* Reworked the renamer to be context
  sensitive\n* Added new error types for un-renaming\n* Modified ASG helper functions
  and updated tests to conform with renamer rework\n* Added support for introduction
  forms (ValNode stuff, ASG helper function, tests)\n* Added support for catamorphism
  elimination forms\n* Added support for pattern matching elimination form\n\n## 1.1.0
  -- 2025-07-11\n\n### Added \n\n* Representation of datatype declarations and datatype
  types \n* Generators for various flavors of data declaration and value type \n*
  A \"kind checker\" which serves as a basic sanity check on datatype declarations
  ingested by the pipeline \n* Base functor transformation machinery \n* Tests for
  the base functor transformation \n* Misc internal helpers to support the above functionality
  \n* Ledger type definitions for use in the ASG\n* Support for primops over data
  types\n* Support for arity-six primops in the ASG\n\nInitial version\n\n## 1.0.0
  -- 2025-05-07\n  \n"

description: "# Covenant\n\n# What is this?\n\nCovenant is a standalone IR, designed
  as a target for front-end DSLs for writing\nCardano scripts. It uses [call-by-push-value][cbpv]
  and is\n[Turner-total][turner-total], which gives it a high degree of analyzability.\nFurthermore,
  it uses a fully hash-consed structure.\n\n# How do I use this?\n\nThis is currently
  a work-in-progress. Begin with the documentation in\n`Covenant.ASG` and `Covenant.Type`.\n\n#
  What do I need?\n\nOur policy is to support the latest three GHC versions; see the
  Cabal file's\n`tested-with` field to see which exact versions are supported. This
  is enforced\nusing `get-tested` in our CI.\n\nWe support only [Tier 1 platforms](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/platforms#tier-1-platforms).
  \nCovenant is developed using the lowest supported version.\n\n# License\n\nCovenant
  is licensed under Apache 2.0. Please see the `LICENSE` file for more\ninformation.
