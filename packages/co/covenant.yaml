description: "# Covenant\n\n# What is this?\n\nCovenant is a standalone IR, designed
  as a target for front-end DSLs for writing\nCardano scripts. It uses [call-by-push-value][cbpv]
  and is\n[Turner-total][turner-total], which gives it a high degree of analyzability.\nFurthermore,
  it uses a fully hash-consed structure.\n\n# How do I use this?\n\nThis is currently
  a work-in-progress. Begin with the documentation in\n`Covenant.ASG` and `Covenant.Type`.\n\n#
  What do I need?\n\nOur policy is to support the latest three GHC versions; see the
  Cabal file's\n`tested-with` field to see which exact versions are supported. This
  is enforced\nusing `get-tested` in our CI.\n\nWe support only [Tier 1 platforms](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/platforms#tier-1-platforms).
  \nCovenant is developed using the lowest supported version.\n\n# License\n\nCovenant
  is licensed under Apache 2.0. Please see the `LICENSE` file for more\ninformation.
