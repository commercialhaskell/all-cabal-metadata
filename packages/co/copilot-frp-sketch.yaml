description: |-
  This extends Copilot with a FRP-like interface which can be used to
  implement simple standalone programs (sketches) for embedded boards.

  It is used by arduino-copilot and zephyr-copilot.

  Copilot is a stream (i.e., infinite lists) domain-specific language
  (DSL) in Haskell that compiles into embedded C. Copilot contains an
  interpreter, multiple back-end compilers, and other verification tools.
