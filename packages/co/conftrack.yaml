description: |-
  A library for handling multiple config files and keep track of where
  config values came from.

  Config values can be read from json, yaml, or environment variables;
  it is also possible to implement custom configuration sources via a
  type class.

  Provenance of config values is tracked while reading them; an application
  using this library can easily print a listing detailing which files were
  read and which file provided (or failed to provide) an individual value.
