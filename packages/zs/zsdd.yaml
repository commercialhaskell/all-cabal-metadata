description: |-
  This package provides an efficient representation of propositions and families of sets as
  directed acyclic graphs.
  Internally this is a Free monad with shared subterms.
  All operations are linear in the size of the diagram, but the size of the
  diagram is also proportional to the number of operations.

  There are two reduction stratergies 'Simple' and 'ZeroSup'.
  The former is generic and widely applicable, whereas the latter is specialised to sparse formulas.
  Sparse formulas are those with few models or where most atoms are false.
  A typical use cases of this mode is when modelling families of sets.
