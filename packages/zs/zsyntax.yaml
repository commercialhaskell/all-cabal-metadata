  # zsyntax core library

  This library is a Haskell implementation of an automated theorem
  prover for Zsyntax, a logical calculus for molecular biology inspired
  by linear logic, that can be used to automatically verify biological
  pathways expressed as logical sequents.

  The prover implements fully-automatic forward proof search for the
  Zsyntax sequent calculus (ZBS), a logical calculus for a
  context-sensitive fragment of multiplicative linear logic where
  sequents are decorated so to account for the biochemical constraints.

  The theory behind the Zsyntax sequent calculus and its proof search
  procedure is developed in F. Sestini, S. Crafa, Proof-search in a
  context-sensitive logic for molecular biology, Journal of Logic and
  Computation, 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1093/logcom/exy028).
