description: "\n= README\n\nThis is the README file to hslibsvm, a haskell binding
  to\n\n  \"LIBSVM -- A Library for Support Vector Machines\"\n\nwhich is obtainable
  through its website: \n  http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm\n\n\n== License\n\nThe
  library is itself written in C++ with its interface exposed via C. \nYou need to
  have the library installed for this binding to be install work \ncorrectly.\nLibSVM
  and this binding are licensed under the BSD 3 clause license.\nYou should have received
  a file named LICENSE along with this source code.\nAll the code contained in this
  bundle is licensed under the license \nconatained in that file.\n\n== Version\n\nThis
  is hslibsvm version 2.89.0.1. \nIf hslibsvm has the version (*).X.Y, this means
  that (*) mirrors the \nversion of LibSVM this binding corresponds to while X and
  Y give \ninformation about hslibsvm. Changes in Y correspond to added functionality,\ndocumentation
  updates and generally backwards compatible changes.\nChanges in X generally correspond
  to interface changes which might break\ncompatibility with erlier versions.\n\n==
  Installation\n\nYou need LibSVM 2.88 or 2.89 installed to use this binding.\n\nMac
  OS X Tiger: On Mac OS X Tiger this binding has been tested and found \nworking fine
  with the MacPorts version of LibSVM.\n\nWindows: On windows things are a little
  bit trickier and have only been \ntested with Cygwin and MinGW/MSys. First you need
  to download and unpack\nLibSVM. After that use the Cygwin/MSys shell to change to
  the directory\nof the unpacked files and type 'make'. This should generate a file
  svm.o.\nNow type 'ar rc libsvm.a svm.o && ranlib libsvm.a', which should generate\nthe
  file libsvm.a.\nNow copy that file to a location where you can find it (*nix standard
  would\nbe /usr/local/lib and copy svm.h to a path where you can find it to (*nix\nstandard
  would be /usr/local/include). Or just leave the files where they\nare, if you don't
  mind keeping the directory where you unarchived LibSVM\naround.\nAfter doing this
  you should be able to install hslibsvm with the command:\n\ncabal install \\\n--extra-include-dirs=path-to-svm.h
  \\\n--extra-lib-dirs=path-to-libsvm.a\n\nNote that for Cygwin you need to specify
  the paths as absolute windows\npaths with a leading drive letter.\n\nLinux: You're
  on your own here. Sorry.\n\n== Bugs, Suggestions, Stuff...\n\nIf you find any bugs
  or you have any suggestions contact me at\ngnn dot github at gmail dot com.\nThis
  is my first cabal package so if I made any errors I definitely\nwould like to know
  them so I can correct them and learn from them.\n"
