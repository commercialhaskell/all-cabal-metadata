  A library for reading CDB (Constant Database) files.

  CDB files are immutable key-value stores, designed for extremely fast and
  memory-efficient construction and lookup. They can be as large as 4GB, and
  at no point in their construction or use must all data be loaded into
  memory. CDB files can contain multiple values for a given key.

  For more information on the CDB file format, please see:
