  # Zstandard bindings for Haskell

  [![Travis](https://api.travis-ci.org/luispedro/hs-zstd.png)](https://travis-ci.org/luispedro/hs-zstd)

  This is a fork of the original [Facebook
  project](https://github.com/facebookarchive/hs-zstd) which is unmaintained and
  produces incorrectly compressed files. This repository fixes these. If the
  original maintainers want to take the project back, I am happy to delete this
  one.

  This library provides Haskell bindings to the
  [Zstandard compression library](http://facebook.github.io/zstd/).

  The library is structured to provide several layers of abstraction.

  * For the simplest use cases, the top-level
    [`Zstd`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/zstd/docs/Codec-Compression-Zstd.html)
    module is the best place to get started.

  * If you need to stream a large amount of data with a constant memory
    footprint, use the
    [`Zstd.Streaming`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hs-zstd/docs/Codec-Compression-Zstd-Streaming.html)
    module. This can also be used as a building block for adapting to
    streaming libraries such as `pipes` and `conduit`.  (If you need to
    use lazy bytestrings instead, see the
    [`Zstd.Lazy`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hs-zstd/docs/Codec-Compression-Zstd-Lazy.html)
    module.  This is built using the abstractions from the
    `Zstd.Streaming` module.)

  * When your usage is dominated by lots of small messages (presumably
    using pre-computed compression dictionaries), use the
    [`Zstd.Efficient`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hs-zstd/docs/Codec-Compression-Zstd-Efficient.html)
    module to amortize the cost of allocating and initializing context
    and dictionary values.

  If you'd like to help improve the code, please
  [read the contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).  This discusses
  how to file bugs and submit changes to the code itself.

  ## API documentation

  The APIs should be easy to understand and work with, and you can find
  [documentation on Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hs-zstd).
