synopsis: A Lua language interpreter embedding in Haskell
changelog: ! "## Changelog\n\n### 0.9.5.{1,2}\n\n- Relax upper bound on exceptions\n\n###
  0.9.5\n\n- Provide Optional as a replacement for OrNil. Exports of the latter\n
  \ have been fixed.\n- Provide utility function `raiseError`: Its argument will be
  thrown as\n  an error in Lua.\n- Add `modifyLuaError`: The function lives in Foreign.Lua.Error
  and\n  allows to alter error messages. This is most useful for amending\n  errors
  with additional information.\n- Fixed a bug in `toList` which left a element on
  the stack if\n  deserializing that element lead to an error. This also affected
  the\n  FromLuaStack instance for lists.\n- Fixed a bug in `pairsFromTable` which
  left a key-value pair on the\n  stack if either of them could not be read into the
  expected type. This\n  also affected the FromLuaStack instance for Map.\n\n### 0.9.4\n\n-
  Make Lua an instance of MonadMask: MonadMask from Control.Monad.Catch\n  allows
  to mask asynchronous exceptions. This allows to define a\n  finalizer for Lua operations.\n-
  Add functions and constants to refer to stack indices: The functions\n  `nthFromBottom`,
  `nthFromTop` as well as the constants `stackTop` and\n  `stackBottom` have been
  introduced. Numeric constants are less clear,\n  and named constants can aid readability.\n-
  Add type OrNil: This type can be used when dealing with optional\n  arguments to
  Lua functions.\n- Add function absindex: it converts the acceptable index `idx`
  into an\n  equivalent absolute index (that is, one that does not depend on the\n
  \ stack top). The function calls `lua_absindex` when compiled with Lua\n  5.2 or
  later; for Lua 5.1, it is reimplemented in Haskell.\n- Functions in `tasty` which
  have been deprecated have been replaced\n  with non-deprecated alternatives.\n\n\n###
  0.9.3\n\n- Re-export more FunctionCalling helpers in `Foreign.Lua`: The typeclass\n
  \ `ToHaskellFunction` and the helper function `toHaskellFunction` are\n  useful
  when working with functions. Importing them separately from\n  `Foreign.Lua.FunctionCalling`
  was an unnecessary burden; they are\n  therefor now re-exported by the main module.\n-
  Export registry-relatd constants `refnil` and `noref`: The constants\n  are related
  to Lua's registry functions (`ref` and `unref`).\n- Add helper to convert functions
  into CFunction: A new helper\n  `wrapHaskellFunction` is provided. It expects a\n
  \ HaskellImportedFunction userdata (as produced by\n  `pushHaskellFunction`) on
  top of the stack and replaces it with a C\n  function. The new function converts
  error values generated with\n  `lerror` into Lua errors, i.e. it calls `lua_error`.\n-
  Add utility function `setglobal'`: It works like `setglobal`, but\n  works with
  packages and nested tables (dot-notation only).\n\n### 0.9.2\n\n- Add cabal flag
  'export-dynamic': Default behavior is to include all symbols in\n  the dynamic symbol
  table, as this enables users to load dynamic lua libraries.\n  However, it is sometimes
  desirable to disable, e.g., when compiling a fully\n  static binary. See jgm/pandoc#3986.\n\n###
  0.9.1\n\n- Increase user-friendlyness of error messages: The error message returned
  by\n  `toHaskellFunction` hinted at the fact that the failing function is a Haskell\n
  \ function. This is mostly unnecessary information and might have confused\n  users.\n\n###
  0.9.0\n\n- Added cabal flag to allow fully safe garbage collection: Lua garbage\n
  \ collection can occur in most of the API functions, even in those usually not\n
  \ calling back into haskell and hence marked as optimizable. The effect of this\n
  \ is that finalizers which call Haskell functions will cause the program to\n  hang.
  A new flag `allow-unsafe-gc` is introduced and enabled by default.\n  Disabling
  this flag will mark more C API functions as potentially calling back\n  into Haskell.
  This has a serious performance impact.\n- `FromLuaStack` and `ToLuaStack` instances
  for lazy ByteStrings are added.\n- None-string error messages are handled properly:
  Lua allows error messages to\n  be of any type, but the haskell error handlers expected
  string values. Tables,\n  booleans, and other non-string values are now handled
  as well and converted to\n  strings.\n\n### 0.8.0\n\n- Use newtype definitions instead
  of type aliases for LuaNumber and LuaInteger.\n  This makes it easier to ensure
  the correct numeric instances in situations\n  where Lua might have been compiled
  with 32-bit numbers.\n- Instances of `FromLuaStack` and `ToLuaStack` for `Int` are
  removed. The\n  correctness of these instances cannot be guaranteed if Lua was compiled
  with a\n  non-standard integer type.\n\n### 0.7.1\n\n- The flag `lua_32bits` was
  added to allow users to compile Lua for 32-bit\n  systems.\n- When reading a list,
  throw an error if the lua value isn't a table instead of\n  silently returning an
  empty list.\n\n### 0.7.0\n\n- Tuples from pairs to octuples have been made instances
  of `FromLuaStack` and\n  `ToLuaStack`.\n- New functions `dostring` and `dofile`
  are provided to load and run strings and\n  files in a single step.\n- `LuaStatus`
  was renamed to `Status`, the *Lua* prefix was removed from its\n  type constructors.\n-
  The constructor `ErrFile` was added to `Status`. It is returned by `loadfile`\n
  \ if the file cannot be read.\n- Remove unused FFI bindings and unused types, including
  all functions unsafe to\n  use from within Haskell and the library functions added
  with 0.5.0. Users with\n  special requirements should define their own wrappers
  and raw bindings.\n- The module *Foreign.Lua.Api.SafeBindings* was merge into\n
  \ *Foreign.Lua.Api.RawBindings*.\n- FFI bindings are changed to use newtypes where
  sensible, most notably\n  `StackIndex`, `NumArgs`, and `NumResults`, but also the
  newly introduced\n  newtypes `StatusCode`, `TypeCode`, and `LuaBool`.\n- Add functions
  `tointegerx` and `tonumberx` which can be used to get and check\n  values from the
  stack in a single step.\n- The signature of `concat` was changed from `Int -> Lua
  ()` to\n  `NumArgs -> Lua ()`.\n- The signature of `loadfile` was changed from `String
  -> Lua Int` to\n  `String -> Lua Status`. \n- The type `LTYPE` was renamed to `Type`,
  its constructors were renamed to\n  follow the pattern `Type<Typename>`. `LuaRelation`
  was renamed to\n  `RelationalOperator`, the *Lua* prefix was removed from its constructors.\n-
  Add function `tolist` to allow getting a generic list from the stack without\n  having
  to worry about the overlapping instance with `[Char]`.\n\n\n### 0.6.0\n\n* Supported
  Lua Versions now include Lua 5.2 and Lua 5.3. LuaJIT and Lua 5.1\n  remain supported
  as well.\n* Flag `use-pkgconfig` was added to allow discovery of library and include
  paths\n  via pkg-config. Setting a specific Lua version flag now implies `system-lua`.\n
  \ (Sean Proctor)\n* The module was renamed from `Scripting.Lua` to `Foreign.Lua`.
  The code is now\n  split over multiple sub-modules. Files processed with hsc2hs
  are restricted to\n  Foreign.Lua.Api.\n* A `Lua` monad (reader monad over LuaState)
  is introduced. Functions which took\n  a LuaState as their first argument are changed
  into monadic functions within\n  that monad.\n* Error handling has been redesigned
  completely. A new LuaException was\n  introduced and is thrown in unexpected situations.
  Errors in lua which are\n  leading to a `longjmp` are now caught with the help of
  additional C wrapper\n  functions. Those no longer lead to uncontrolled program
  termination but are\n  converted into a LuaException.\n* `peek` no longer returns
  `Maybe a` but just `a`. A LuaException is thrown if\n  an error occurs (i.e. in
  situtations where Nothing would have been returned\n  previously).\n* The `StackValue`
  typeclass has been split into `FromLuaStack` and\n  `ToLuaStack`. Instances not
  satisfying the law `x == push x *> peek (-1)` have\n  been dropped.\n* Documentation
  of API functions was improved. Most docstrings have been copied\n  from the official
  Lua manual, enriched with proper markup and links, and\n  changed to properly describe
  hslua specifics when necessary.\n* Example programs have been moved to a separate
  repository.\n* Unused files were removed. (Sean Proctor)\n\n### 0.5.0\n\n* New raw
  functions for `luaopen_base`, `luaopen_package`, `luaopen_string`,\n  `luaopen_table`,
  `luaopen_math`, `luaopen_io`, `luaopen_os`, `luaopen_debug`\n  and their high-level
  wrappers (with names `openbase`, `opentable` etc.)\n  implemented.\n* Remove custom
  versions of `loadfile` and `loadstring`.\n* Drop support for GHC versions < 7.8,
  avoid compiler warnings.\n* Ensure no symbols are stripped when linking the bundled
  lua interpreter.\n* Simplify `tostring` function definition. (Sean Proctor)\n* Explicitly
  deprecate `strlen`. (Sean Proctor)\n* Add links to lua documentation for functions
  wrapping the official lua C API.\n  (Sean Proctor).\n\n### 0.4.1\n\n* Bugfix(#30):
  `tolist` wasn't popping elements of the list from stack.\n\n### 0.4.0\n\n* `pushstring`
  and `tostring` now uses `ByteString` instead of `[Char]`.\n* `StackValue [Char]`
  instance is removed, `StackValue ByteString` is added.\n* `StackValue a => StackValue
  [a]` instance is added. It pushes a Lua array to\n  the stack. `pushlist`, `islist`
  and `tolist` functions are added.\n* Type errors in Haskell functions now propagated
  differently. See the\n  `Scripting.Lua` documentation for detailed explanation.
  This should fix\n  segfaults reported several times.\n* `lua_error` function is
  removed, it's never safe to call in Haskell.\n\nRelated issues and pull requests:
  #12, #26, #24, #23, #18.\n\n### 0.3.14\n\n* Pkgconf-based setup removed. Cabal is
  now using `extra-libraries` to link with Lua.\n* `luajit` flag is added to link
  hslua with LuaJIT.\n\n### 0.3.13\n\n* Small bugfix related with GHCi running under
  Windows.\n\n### 0.3.12\n\n* `pushrawhsfunction` and `registerrawhsfunction` functions
  are added.\n* `apicheck` flag is added to Cabal package to enable Lua API checking.
  (useful for debugging)\n\n### 0.3.11\n\n* `luaL_ref` and `luaL_unref` functions
  are added.\n"

description: ! "# hslua – Lua interpreter interface for Haskell\n\n[![Build Status]](https://travis-ci.org/hslua/hslua)\n[![AppVeyor
  Status]](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/tarleb/hslua-r2y18)\n[![Hackage]](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hslua)\n\nHslua
  provides bindings, wrappers, types, and helper functions to bridge haskell\nand
  lua.\n\n[Build Status]: https://travis-ci.org/hslua/hslua.svg?branch=master\n[AppVeyor
  Status]: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ldutrilgxhpcau94/branch/master?svg=true\n[Hackage]:
  http://img.shields.io/hackage/v/hslua.svg\n\n\nOverview\n--------\n\n[Lua](https://lua.org)
  is a small, well-designed, embeddable scripting language.\nIt has become the de-facto
  default to make programs extensible and is widely\nused everywhere from servers
  over games and desktop applications up to security\nsoftware and embedded devices.
  This package provides Haskell bindings to Lua,\nenable coders to embed the language
  into their programs, making them scriptable.\n\nHsLua ships with batteries included
  and includes the most recent Lua version.\nHowever, cabal flags make it easy to
  swap this out in favor of a Lua version\nalready installed on the host system. It
  supports the versions 5.1, 5.2, 5.3,\nand LuaJIT.\n\n\nInteracting with Lua\n--------------------\n\nHsLua
  provides the `Lua` type to define Lua operations. The operations are\nexecuted by
  calling `runLua`. A simple \"Hello, World\" program, using the Lua\n`print` function,
  is given below:\n\n``` haskell\nimport Foreign.Lua\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = runLua
  prog\n  where\n    prog :: Lua ()\n    prog = do\n      openlibs  -- load lua libraries
  so we can use 'print'\n      callFunc \"print\" \"Hello, World!\"\n```\n\n### The
  Lua stack\n\nLua's API is stack-centered: most operations involve pushing values
  to the stack\nor receiving items from the stack. E.g., calling a function is performed
  by\npushing the function onto the stack, followed by the function arguments in the\norder
  they should be passed to the function. The API function `call` then\ninvokes the
  function with given numbers of arguments, pops the function and\nparameters of the
  stack, and pushes the results.\n\n    ,----------.\n    |  arg 3   |\n    +----------+\n
  \   |  arg 2   |\n    +----------+\n    |  arg 1   |\n    +----------+                  ,----------.\n
  \   | function |    call 3 1      | result 1 |\n    +----------+   ===========>
  \  +----------+\n    |          |                  |          |\n    |  stack   |
  \                 |  stack   |\n    |          |                  |          |\n\nManually
  pushing and pulling arguments can become tiresome, so HsLua makes\nfunction calling
  simple by providing `callFunc`. It uses type-magic to allow\ndifferent numbers of
  arguments. Think about it as having the signature\n\n    callFunc :: String -> a1
  -> a2 -> … -> res\n\nwhere the arguments `a1, a2, …` must be of a type which can
  be pushed to the Lua\nstack, and the result-type `res` must be constructable from
  a value on the Lua\nstack.\n\n### Getting values from and to the Lua stack\n\nConversion
  between Haskell and Lua values is governed by two type classes:\n\n``` haskell\n--
  | A value that can be read from the Lua stack.\nclass FromLuaStack a where\n  --
  | Check if at index @n@ there is a convertible Lua value and\n  --   if so return
  it.  Throws a @'LuaException'@ otherwise.\n  peek :: StackIndex -> Lua a\n```\n\nand\n\n```
  haskell\n-- | A value that can be pushed to the Lua stack.\nclass ToLuaStack a where\n
  \ -- | Pushes a value onto Lua stack, casting it into meaningfully\n  --   nearest
  Lua type.\n  push :: a -> Lua ()\n```\n\nMany basic data types (except for numeric
  types, see the FAQ) have instances for\nthese type classes. New instances can be
  defined for custom types using the\nfunctions in `Foreign.Lua.Api` (also exported
  in `Foreign.Lua`).\n\n\nBuild flags\n-----------\n\nThe following cabal build flags
  are supported:\n\n- `system-lua`: Use the locally installed Lua version instead
  of the version\n  shipped as part of HsLua.\n\n- `use-pkgconfig`: Use `pkg-config`
  to discover library and include paths. This\n  is used only when the `system-lua`
  flag is set or implied.\n\n- `lua501`: Build against Lua 5.1; this implies the flag
  `system-lua` as well.\n\n- `lua502`: Build against Lua 5.2; this implies the flag
  `system-lua` as well.\n\n- `luajit`: Build against LuaJIT; this implies the flag
  `system-lua` as well.\n\n- `allow-unsafe-gc`: Allow optimizations which make Lua's
  garbage collection\n  potentially unsafe; haskell finalizers must be handled with
  extreme care. This\n  is *enabled* per default, as this is rarely a problem in practice.\n\n-
  `apicheck`: Compile Lua with its API checks enabled.\n\n- `lua_32bits`: Compile
  Lua for a 32-bits system (e.g., i386, PowerPC G4).\n\n\n### Example: using a different
  lua version\n\nTo use a system-wide installed Lua/LuaJIT when linking hslua as a
  dependency,\nbuild/install your package using `--constraint=\"hslua +system-lua\"`
  or for\nLuaJIT: `--constraint=\"hslua +luajit\"`. For example, you can install Pandoc
  with\nhslua that uses system-wide LuaJIT like this:\n\n``` sh\ncabal install pandoc
  --constraint=\"hslua +system-lua +luajit\"\n```\n\nor with stack:\n\n``` sh\nstack
  install pandoc --flag=hslua:luajit\n```\n\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n**Is anybody using this?**
  Absolutely. E.g., [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org), the\nuniversal document converter,
  is written in Haskell and includes a Lua\ninterpreter, enabling programmatic modifications
  of documents via Lua.\nFurthermore, custom output formats can be defined via Lua
  scripts. This has been\nused in [pandoc-scholar](https://github.com/pandoc-scholar/pandoc-scholar)\n([paper](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-112/))
  to allow for semantically enriched\nscholarly articles.\n\n**Where are the coroutine
  related functions?** Yielding from a coroutine works\nvia `longjmp`, which plays
  very badly with Haskell's RTS. Tests to get\ncoroutines working with HsLua were
  unsuccessful. No coroutine related functions\nare exported from the default module
  for that reason. However, raw bindings to\nthe C API functions are still provided
  in `Foreign.Lua.RawBindings`. If you get\ncoroutines to work, or just believe that
  there should be wrapper functions for\nother reasons, we'd love to hear from you.\n\n**Why
  are there no predefined stack instances for default numerical types?**\nHsLua defines
  instances for the `FromLuaStack` and `ToLuaStack` type-classes\nonly if the following
  law holds: `return x == push x *> peek x`. Lua can be\ncompiled with customized
  number types, making it impossible to verify the\ncorrectness of the above equation.
  Furthermore, instances for numerical types\ncan be based on those of LuaInteger
  and LuaNumber and are easy to write.\nTherefor hslua doesn't provide any such instances.\n"
