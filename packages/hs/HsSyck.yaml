description: |-
  This is a simple YAML ('Yet Another Markup Language') processor,
  used by the Pugs project for handling data serialization; this can be
  useful for optimization and caching purposes.

  This is an interface to the @syck@ C library for parsing and
  dumping YAML data. It lets you transform textual YAML data into an
  object of type 'YamlNode', and vice versa, fast.
