description: |-
  Haskell FFI Binding Modules Generator (HSFFIG) is a tool that parses
  C library include files (.h) and generates Haskell Foreign Functions Interface
  import declarations for all functions, #define'd constants (where possible),
  enumerations, and structures/unions (to access their members).
  It is assumed that the GNU C Compiler and Preprocessor are used.
  Auto-generated Haskell modules may be imported into an application
  to get access to the foreign library's functions and variables.

  The package provides a small library that programs using auto-generated
  imports have to link to (specify HSFFIG as one of build-depends), and two
  executable programs:

  * hsffig: a filter program reading pre-processed include files
  from standard input, and producing one large .hsc file to be processed
  by @hsc2hs@, and possibly cut into pieces by @modsplit@. See
  <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/HSFFIG/Tutorial> for more information.

  * ffipkg: a wrapper over @hsffig@ which automates the process of
  building a Cabal package out of C include files provided by running
  the preprocessor, @hsffig@, the splitter, and preparing the files
  necessary to build a package. See
  <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/FFI_imports_packaging_utility> for
  more information.

  Please note that @hsffig@ and @ffipkg@ will likely not work properly
  with C++ include files.
