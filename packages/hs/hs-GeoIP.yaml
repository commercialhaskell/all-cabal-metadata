  This library provides fast, idiomatic Haskell bindings to MaxMind's
  GeoIPCity IP-based geolocation C API.

  Make sure you have the MaxMind C API installed before installing
  this library, as it depends on the C API.

  MaxMind GeoIP City database allows geo-location lookups from IP addresses.

  To get started, you can download the latest binary database
  distribution from: <http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity>
