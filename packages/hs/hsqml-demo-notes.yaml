  hsqml-demo-notes
  ================

  This sticky notes program using HsQML was introduced in my November 2014 talk
  to the London Haskell User Group. The 'hsqml-notes' executable can be passed
  an argument to specify which QML front-end to use:

  notes      - Stardard UI (default)
  notes-pro  - Alternative UI using Qt Quick Controls
  notes-flip - Standard UI with flipable double-sided notes
  notes-dual - Standard and alternate UI displayed simultaneously
