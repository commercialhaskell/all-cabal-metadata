  Presenting hspresent
  ====================

  This is a simple program that lets you give powerpoint-like presentations in
  your terminal (for certain definitions of powerpoint-like). It's extremely basic
  and unintelligent. Don't expect much.

  Compile and install using cabal:
      cabal build && cabal install

  This will compile hspresent, and install an `hspresent` command line program.

  You can download the latest stable release of hspresent on
  [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hspresent). The git repository is
  online at `git://github.com/eklitzke/hspresent.git`.

  Usage
  -----
  Invoke like `hspresent /path/to/your/presentation`. Left and right arrow keys
  move between slides, and hitting `q` or `Ctrl-C` quits the presentation.

  The file format is really simple right now. Slides are separated by lines
  consisting of the characters `--`. You can put the single character `.` on a
  line to demarcate a "split" frame. A split frame really creates a new frame with
  the contents of the previous frame copied at the front (this is similar to how
  beamer works). That's it. Here's an example presentation:
      the title of the first slide
      this is
      .
      really cool
      --
      the title of the second slide
      hooray for hspresent
      --
      look at how fancy the title to this slide is
      * bullet point one
      * bullet point two
