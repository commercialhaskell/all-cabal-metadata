  This is a Haskell binding for the TradeKing developers API (https://developers.tradeking.com/).

  It currently supports retrieving quotes and stock information, as well as the quote and trade
  streaming API.

  Support for the other TradeKing API endpoints is forthcoming.

  To use, install the package via cabal. This will create an executable called `tradeking`. To
  connect to the TradeKing API, you will need to create a new personal application from the
  TradeKing developers site. This should give you four strings: an OAuth consumer key, an OAuth
  consumer secret, an OAuth Token, and an OAuth Token Secret. You supply these into the
  `tradeking` application using a configuration file (either `$(HOME)/.tradeking` or
  `/etc/tradeking.conf`). This configuration file should look like:

  > consumer-key = <tradeking consumer key>
  > consumer-secret = <tradeking consumer secret>
  > oauth-token = <tradeking oauth token>
  > oauth-token-secret = <tradeking oauth token secret>

  Now you can run `tradeking quote SPY` to have it return the current quote for the S&P 500
  ETF. `tradeking info MSFT` will provide information on Microsoft, and `tradeking stream MSFT`
  will provide a live stream of `MSFT` quotes. All commands accept more than one stock, so
  `tradeking quote MSFT AAPL`, `tradeking info MSFT SPY`, and `tradeking stream SPY AAPL` work as
  expected (subject to TradeKing) limits.

  You can also request quotes programmatically, using the API described here.
