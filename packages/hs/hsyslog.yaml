description: |-
  A Haskell interface to @syslog(3)@ as specified in
  <http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/syslog.html POSIX.1-2008>.
  The entire public API lives in "System.Posix.Syslog". There is a set of exposed
  modules available underneath that one, which contain various implementation details
  that may be useful to other developers who want to implement syslog-related
  functionality. /Users/ of @syslog@, however, do not need them.

  An example program that demonstrates how to use this library is available in the
  <https://github.com/peti/hsyslog/blob/master/example/Main.hs examples> directory of
  this package.
