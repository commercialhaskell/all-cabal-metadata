                   hspread : a client library for spread

      hspread is a client library for the Spread toolkit[1].
      It is fully implemented in haskell and supports the most recent version
      of the protocol. Its aim is to make easier to implement correct distribuited
      applications by taking advantage of the guarantees granted by Spread:
      such as reliable and total ordered messages. It's intended to be used
      with a serialization library like binary[2], and a separate installation
      of the spread deamon.

  Installing:

    It installs like every other cabal package:
        runhaskell Setup configure  -- this can fail with missing dependecies
        runhaskell Setup build
        runhaskell Setup install    -- you may need superuser privileges here

    Haddock documentation can be generated with:
       runhaskell Setup haddock

    You can then test it with the spflooder clone under examples/,
    not forgetting to have a spread deamon running.
