description: |-
  Generates images suitable for use as CAPTCHAs in online web-form security.  Does not
  integrate with any web framework; simply exports a function that creates the image
  itself as a ByteString (containing a PNG), and the correct answer to the challenge as a
  String.  HS-Captcha is designed to be as simple as possible to integrate in other
  frameworks.
