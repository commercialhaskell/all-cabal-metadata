  # Changelog

  `hslua-list` uses [PVP Versioning](https://pvp.haskell.org).

  ## hslua-list-1.1.2

  Released 2024-09-20.

  -   Lists can now be constructed from iterators.

  -   Added method `:at` to access list elements by index; negative
      indices are counted from the end. A second value can be
      passed, which will be returned if there is no item at the
      given index.

  ## hslua-list-1.1.1

  Released 2023-03-17.

  -   Conversion to strings: added a `__tostring` that lists all
      elements separated by commas and a space, surrounded by braces
      and prefixed with the metatable's name.

  ## hslua-list-1.1.0.1

  Released 2023-01-23.

  -   Ensure that `test/test-list.lua` is included in the release
      tarball.

  ## hslua-list-1.1.0

  Released 2023-03-13.

  -   Removed `pushPandocList`. The function was a left-over from
      pandoc-lua-marshal, the place where this package originated.

  ## hslua-list-1.0.0

  Released 2022-10-10.

  -   To boldly go where no Haskell library has gone before.

  hslua-list
  ==========

  Opinionated, fast, and extensible implementation of a Lua *List*
  type. The type re-uses some parts of Lua's base library, so the
  *base* library must be loaded before this one.
