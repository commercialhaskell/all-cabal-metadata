description: Direct implementation of the SAML XML standard (https://www.oasis-open.org/standards#samlv2.0),
  along with some related dependencies.  This is currently partial, as the standard
  is quite extensive, but is sufficient to build a functioning SP and fully validate
  responses.  The module layout basically follows the standard definition documentation.  Its
  use still requires a fairly extensive understanding of SAML.
