  INTRO

  Sparklines are high content to size ratio minigraphs inspired by Edward Tufte.

  The focus of a sparkline is to provide additional context inline with text
  so users can do more informed analysis and make better decisions.  To make
  them fit with inline text, sparklines are generally small (100px x 30px)
  and dispense with axis labels and units.

  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

  Joe Gregorio's Python implementation of Sparklines served as an inspiration
  for doing a Haskell version.  He's done some good work, make sure to check
