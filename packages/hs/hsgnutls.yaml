  hsgnutls is a wrapper to the GNU TLS Library.
  Currently it is in quite early stages but offers client functionality
  and parts of the server-side interface. Anonymous and X509 authentication
  is supported, but SRP and OpenPGP will appear in a future version.
  hsgnutls uses the attribute implementation borrowed from Gtk2Hs.

  Note this is not the official hsgnutls, but rather a fork updated for the needs
  of the Barracuda ad-hoc chat client, which repo can be found at
  <http://repos.mroot.net/sep07-adhoc>.
