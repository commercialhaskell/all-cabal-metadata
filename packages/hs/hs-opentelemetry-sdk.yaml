description: "# OpenTelemetry SDK for Haskell\n\nThis package provides everything
  a functioning implementation of\nthe OpenTelemetry the API, useful for exporting
  a variety of\ntracing, logging, and metric data.\n\n## Why use OpenTelemetry tracing?\n\nIf
  you’re running a user-facing software service, it probably qualifies as a distributed
  service. You might have a proxy, an application and a database, or a more complicated
  microservice architecture. Regardless of the level of complexity, a distributed
  system means that multiple distinct services must work together in concert.\n\nTracing
  helps tie together instrumentation from separate services, or from different methods
  within one service. This makes it easier to identify the source of errors, find
  performance problems, or understand how data flows through a large system.\n\n##
  What is a Trace?\n\nA trace tells the story of a complete unit of work in your system.
  A unit of work is generally application specific, but often comes in some of the
  following forms:\n\n- An HTTP request initiated by a user or third party.\n- Execution
  of a cron job.\n- An async task being pulled from a queue and processed.\n\nFor
  example, when a user loads a web page, their request might go to an edge proxy and/or
  load balancer. That proxy talks to a Haskell web service, which calls out to a Redis
  cache and PostgreSQL database. There could be multiple calls out to third-party
  services via HTTP APIs. Finally, the backend returns a result to the client.\n\n###
  Spans\nEach portion of the web request's lifecycle can be told by a span. A span
  is a single piece of instrumentation from a single location in your code or infrastructure.
  A span represents a single \"unit of work\" done by a service. Each span contains
  several key pieces of data:\n\n- A service name identifying the service the span
  is from\n- A name identifying the role of the span (like function or method name)\n-
  A timestamp that corresponds to the start of the span\n- A duration that describes
  how long that unit of work took to complete\n- An ID that uniquely identifies the
  span\n- A trace ID identifying which trace the span belongs to\n- A parent ID representing
  the parent span that called this span. (There is no parent ID for the root span
  of a given trace, which denotes that it's the start of the trace.)\n- Any additional
  metadata that might be helpful.\n- Zero or more links to related spans. Links can
  be useful for connecting causal relationships between things like web requests that
  enqueue asynchronous tasks to be processed.\n- Events, which denote a point in time
  occurrence. These can be useful for recording data about a span such as when an
  exception was thrown, or to emit structured logs into the span tree.\n\nA trace
  is made up of multiple spans. Tracing vendors such as Zipkin, Jaeger, Honeycomb,
  Datadog, Lightstep, etc. use the metadata from each span to reconstruct the relationships
  between them and generate a trace diagram.\n\n### Context\n\nIn order for OpenTelemetry
  to work, it must store and propagate important telemetry data. For example, when
  a request is received and a span is started it must be available to component which
  want to create child spans. To solve this problem, OpenTelemetry stores the span
  in a data structure called `Context`. \n\nA `Context` is an specialized map structure
  structure that can store values of arbitrary types. As your code executes, the current
  active span will be stored in the `Context`. Creating new spans requires a `Context`,
  which is used to determine the parent span for the newly created span (if a parent
  exists). At the outermost edges of your \"complete unit of work\" that you choose
  to instrument, you can start with an empty context in order to create a root span.\n\n###
  Exporting\n\nOnce you have an application that is instrumented to track interesting
  data about the lifecycle and execution of your units of work, you need to send them
  somewhere! OpenTelemetry has the concept of an `Exporter`, which is an interface
  that receives a set of spans that have completed, and outputs them to a target of
  your choosing. Different vendors provide a number of useful tools for using exported
  span\ndata to understand and monitor how your system is behaving in production.\n\nSee
  the main project README for a list of supported exporters.\n\n### Sampling\n\nIn
  large production systems, it is often not desirable to perform tracing for every
  request\nthat comes through the system.  Sampling is a way to reduce the amount
  of data you send to OpenTelemetry without a significant reduction in the quality
  of your data. It’s like getting samples of food: you can taste all the important
  bits without getting full.\n\nSampling is a process that restricts the amount of
  traces that are generated by a system. The exact sampler you should use depends
  on your specific needs, but in general you should make a decision at the start of
  a trace, and allow the sampling decision to propagate to other services.\n\nTypically,
  the way traces are sampled works like this: when the root span is being processed,
  a random sampling decision is made. If that span is decided to be sampled, it is
  exported and also propagates that decision out to the descendent spans, who follow
  suit, usually via injected HTTP headers signifying that the trace is selected to
  be sampled. That way, all the spans for a particular trace are preserved.\n\n###
  Processing\n\n\n### Tracer\n\nThe OpenTelemetry Tracing API uses a data type called
  a `Tracer` to create traces. These `Tracer`s are designed to be associated with
  one instrumentation library. That way, telemetry they produce can be understood
  to come from the library or portion of your code base that it instruments.\n\nA
  `Tracer` is constructed by calling the `makeTracer` function, which requires a `TracerProvider`
  and `TracerOptions`, which we'll discuss next.\n\n### TracerProvider\n\nA `TracerProvider`
  is key to using OpenTelemetry tracing. It is the data structure responsible for
  designating how spans are processed and exported\nto external systems.\n\n## Install
  Dependencies\n\nAdd `hs-opentelemetry-sdk` to your `package.yaml` or Cabal file.\n\n##
  Trace Your Code\n\n### Initialization\nGet started by importing the `OpenTelemetry.Trace`
  module. It exports most of what you need to instrument your application.\n\n```
  haskell\nimport OpenTelemetry.Trace\n```\n\nInstall a global `TracerProvider` for
  your code. Instrumentation libraries and directly instrumented\nsystems will generally
  use `getGlobalTracerProvider` to create their `Tracer`s, since there is often a
  constraint that function signatures should not make breaking changes. The `getGlobalTracerProvider`
  allows OpenTelemetry to smuggle in the ability to emit tracing details without breaking
  existing APIs for users that aren't even using OpenTelemetry.\n\n``` haskell\nmain
  :: IO ()\nmain = withTracer $ \\tracer -> do\n  -- your existing code here...\n
  \ pure ()\n  where\n    withTracer :: ((TracerOptions -> Tracer) -> IO c) -> IO
  c\n    withTracer f = bracket \n      -- Install the SDK, pulling configuration
  from the environment\n      initializeGlobalTracerProvider\n      -- Ensure that
  any spans that haven't been exported yet are flushed\n      shutdownTracerProvider\n
  \     -- Get a tracer so you can create spans\n      (\\tracerProvider -> f $ makeTracer
  tracerProvider \"your-app-name-or-subsystem\")\n```\n\nThe primary configuration
  mechanism for `initializeGlobalTracerProvider` is via the environment variables
  listed in the official [OpenTelemetry specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/6ad485b743553099476d676f1f0369bae0304547/specification/sdk-environment-variables.md).\n\n<hr/>\n⚠️
  <b>Caution</b> ⚠️\n\nThese environment variables provide extensive configuration
  options for the samplers and exporters to use. Not all of the environment variables
  listed are fully supported yet (contributions welcome!), so make sure to validate
  in a development context that your configuration settings are behaving as expected.\n<hr/>\n\n\n###
  Start Tracing\n\nIn order to create some spans, you'll need a `Tracer`. It's usually
  a good idea to make your tracer\navailable in whatever monadic contexts you frequently
  use:\n\n``` haskell\nimport OpenTelemetry.Trace hiding (inSpan)\nimport OpenTelemetry.Trace.Monad\n\ninstance
  MonadTracer YourMonadHere where\n  getTracer = ...\n```\n\nNow you can get a `Tracer`
  when you need it! Now, find a function towards the outer edges of your unit of work
  that you want to instrument:\n\n``` haskell\nhandleWebRequest :: Request -> IO Response\nhandleWebRequest
  req = makeResponse\n  where\n    makeResponse = ...\n```\n\n... and use one of the
  `inSpan` variants to wrap it like this:\n\n``` haskell\nhandleWebRequest :: Request
  -> IO Response\nhandleWebRequest req = inSpan' (requestPath req) spanArgs $ \\webReqSpan
  -> do\n  resp <- makeResponse\n  addEvent $ NewEvent\n    { name = \"made a response\"\n
  \   , newEventAttributes = []\n    , newEventTimestamp = Nothing -- will be auto-generated
  if not supplied\n    }\n  annotateResponseInfo webReqSpan resp\n  pure resp\n  where\n
  \   makeResponse = ...\n    spanArgs = defaultSpanArguments\n      { attributes
  =\n          [ (\"user.id\", toAttribute (1 :: Int))\n          , (\"http.request.headers.idempotency-key\",
  toAttribute $ fromMaybe \"\" $ lookupIdempotencyKey req)\n          ]\n      }\n
  \   annotateResponseInfo webReqSpan resp = addAttributes webReqSpan\n      [ (\"http.status_code\",
  toAttribute $ responseStatus resp)\n      ]\n```\n\n`inSpan` looks up the current
  parent span from the thread-local[^thread-local-state] `Context` if one exists,
  and uses it to create a span that is appropriately tied to the rest of the trace.
  It will record and rethrow any unhandled synchronous exceptions, and when the code
  executing in the passed in function completes,\nthe span is completed for final
  processing and export to your configured exporter. Once the `inSpan` execution completes,
  it will restore the thread-local `Context` to the state it had prior to execution.\n\n`defaultSpanArguments`
  allows for adding starting attributes to a span, as well as providing links to\nrelated
  spans, and specifying the `SpanKind`.\n\n`addAttributes` can be used to progressively
  enrich spans with data as execution proceeds, so you can fully capture the outcome
  of code as it executes.\n\nThis just scratches the surface of the capabilities that
  OpenTelemetry tracing provides for understanding your systems in production. See
  the `OpenTelemetry.Trace` module for more of the functionality available to you.\n\n###
  Launch your app!\n\nOut of the box, your instrumented app will attempt to send trace
  information to localhost. We recommend running an instance of the\n[OpenTelemetry
  Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) locally where possible, but
  can also set environment variables to configure your application to use different
  exporters, endpoints, and more: \n\n``` shell\nOTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=\"https://api.vendor.xyz\"
  OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=\"x-vendor-api-key=$YOUR_API_KEY,x-vendor-dataset=$YOUR_VENDOR_DATASET_NAME\"
  stack exec yesod-minimal\n```\n\nSee the environment variable mentioned earlier
  in the README for the full list. \n\n<hr/>\n✅ <b>Before you go...</b> ✅\n\nExamples
  of instrumented systems are available here: [Instrumentated application examples](https://github.com/iand675/hs-opentelemetry/blob/main/examples/README.md).\n\nVisit
  the [GitHub project](https://github.com/iand675/hs-opentelemetry#readme) for a list
  of provided instrumentation libraries. We support several packages like `wai`, `persistent`,
  and `yesod` already, and want to provide official instrumentation for as much of
  the Haskell ecosystem as possible. We'd love to also have you contribute instrumentation
  packages to the project if you wrap any public packages yourself.\n\n<hr/>\n\n###

  Thread-local here meaning that the state is scoped to the current Haskell green
  thread. If you do anything concurrently via e.g. `forkIO`, you'll need to use `OpenTelemetry.Context.ThreadLocal`
  to attach the `Context` to your new thread.\n"
