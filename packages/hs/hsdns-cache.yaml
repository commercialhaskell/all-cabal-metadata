  Caching asynchronous DNS resolver built on top of
  GNU ADNS <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ian/adns/>.

  * Resolves several IP addresses for one host (if available)
  in round-robin fashion.

  * Throttles number of parallel requests (so DNS resolving continues to work
  even under heavy load).

  * Errors are cached too (for one minute).

  * Handles CNAMEs (@hsdns@ returns error for them).

  This cache is tested in a long running web-crawler
  (used in <https://bazqux.com>) so it should be safe to use it in real world
  applications.
