  # HsQML

  [![Tests](https://github.com/prolic/HsQML/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/prolic/HsQML/actions?query=workflow%3ATests)
  [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/prolic/HsQML?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/prolic/hsqml)

  HsQML is a Haskell binding to Qt Quick, a cross-platform framework for creating
  graphical user interfaces. For further information on installing and using it,
  please see the project's web site.

  **Home Page:** http://www.gekkou.co.uk/software/hsqml/
  **Original Darcs Repository (outdated):** http://hub.darcs.net/komadori/HsQML

  ## Notes
  - I made some changes, so this library works on newer GHC / cabal versions and has been tested on Qt5.
  - This library has been tested with cabal 3.10.3.0, due to its custom Setup.hs, not all versions of cabal are supported.
  - **Current Status:** This is a maintained fork of the original HsQML project.
