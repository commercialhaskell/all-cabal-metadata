  Haskell interface to the FLTK window toolkit

  * Built using Cabal with hacks.
  * For more information about FLTK see www.fltk.org
  * Porting to windows should be possible, but I don't have the resources to do it.

  Dependencies

  * A very recent version of Cabal is needed
    * 17.11. support for C-Sources in subdirs
    *  6.12. Extra-Lib-Dirs support - not necessary on all platforms.
  * Works with both GHC 6.2 and the CVS version of GHC.
  * FLTK 1.1 headers and library
  * No direct dependency on libstdc++ although libfltk does depend on it.
    This is to avoid issues with linkers doing nasty things.

  Building

  * Download and unpack.
  * Build and install through Cabal as for other Haskell packages:

        runhaskell Setup configure --user --prefix=$HOME
        runhaskell Setup build
        runhaskell Setup install --user

  (You may want to remove the --user flag when installing as root.)

  * see example/
  * library errors are most likely due to missing symlinks
    e.g. libfltk.so -> libfltk.so.1, if someone knows how to fix this
    with Cabal please tell.

  TODO

  * GHCI support is broken due to GHC not supporting weak (W) symbols properly.
  * The Hugs Debian package is not usable.
