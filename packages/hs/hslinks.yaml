description: |-
  A simple utility program that resolves links to Haskell identifiers in Markdown-style text.
  This is useful if you want to maintain documentation of a Haskell program or library outside
  the source code but still have links the Haddock-generated API documentation.

  For usage, see <https://github.com/hanshoglund/hslinks>
