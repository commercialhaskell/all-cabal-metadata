  time is now only included in the test summary if run with\n   `--print-cpu-time`.\n\n##
  Changes in 1.4.0\n - We now have a manual at http://hspec.github.io/.  The sources
  are in\n   `doc/`.  It's still work in progress.  Contributions are very welcome!\n
  - The Haddock documentation now indicates the stability of each exposed\n   module.
  \ `Test.Hspec` is now considered stable.\n - `hspec` now supports command-line options\n
  \  - `--color` can be used to enable/disable colored output\n   - `--format` can
  be used to pick a specific formatter\n   - `--html` can be used to produce an HTML
  report\n   - `--maximum-generated-tests` can be used to specify QuickCheck's\n     `maxSuccess`\n
  \  - `--match` only runs spec items that match a given string\n   - `--re-run` only
  runs spec items that previously failed.  This is\n     undocumented,\n     experimental
  and only works within GHCi (use `:reload` / `:main`)!\n - Runner functions exported
  from `Test.Hspec.Runner` new expect a monadic\n   spec.\n - `fromHUnitTest` has
  been added.  It can be used to run existing HUnit test\n   suites with Hspec.\n
  - The `Example` instance for HUnit `Test`s has been deprecated.\n   `fromHUnitTest`
  can be used instead.  The primary motivation is, that\n   `fromHUnitTest` gives
  more detailed reporting for nested HUnit test suites.\n - `Test.Hspec.Monadic` has
  been deprecated, all functionality is available\n   through one of `Test.Hspec`,
  `Test.Hspec.Core` or `Test.Hspec.Runner`.\n - More of Hspec's internals are now
  exposed from `Test.Hspec.Core`\n - All runner functions for the core spec type (aka
  as non-monadic spec) have\n   been deprecated, use e.g. `Test.Hspec.hspec . fromSpecList`
  instead.  The\n   motivation is to provide an API that does not expose colliding
  names.\n - Some other stuff from `Test.Hspec.Core` that collides with other parts
  of\n   the API has been deprecated.  Compatible alternatives are given in each\n
  \  deprecation message.\n - The default formatter now produces less whitespace (#73)
  + other minor\n   improvements\n - The formatter API has been revamped.\n - The
  exception type is now printed if an example fails due to an exception\n   (#50)\n
  - The number of pending examples is now printed after each test run (#85)\n - `--verbose`
  has been added (#87)\n\n## Changes in 1.3.0\n\n - `Test.Hspec` now re-exports the
  monadic API.  If you still use the\n   non-monadic API, you can use `Test.Hspec.Core`
  as a drop-in replacement.\n\n - `hspec-expectations`, a set of combinators that
  allow to express\n   expectations about the outcome of code examples, is now included
  with Hspec.\n   Have a look at the [README of `hspec-expectations`]\n   (https://github.com/sol/hspec-expectations#readme)\n
  \  for a short introduction.\n\n - `hspec-discover`, a mechanism for automatic spec
  discovery, is now an\n   official part of Hspec.\n   Have a look at [`hspec-discover`'s
  README]\n   (https://github.com/hspec/hspec/tree/master/hspec-discover#readme)\n
  \  for a short introduction.\n\n## Changes in 1.2.0\n\n - `hspec` has been removed,
  and `hspecX` has been renamed to `hspec` (see\n   [#71](https://github.com/hspec/hspec/issues/71))\n\n
  - `hHspec` now returns a summary of the test run.\n\n - The time reporting after
  a test run is not colored anymore.\n\n## Changes in 1.1.3\n\n - `Test.Hspec` warns
  now about future changes: It will re-export\n   `Test.Hspec.Monadic` in the future.
  \ If you still use the non-monadic API,\n   you can either use `Test.Hspec.Core`
  as a drop-in replacement, or migrate your\n   code to the monadic API.\n\n   The
  monadic API is more stable and easier to use.  Now is a good time to\n   switch!\n\n
  - `Test.Hspec.Core` is now a proper superset of `Test.Hspec`\n\n## Changes in 1.1.2\n\n
  * All descriptions of nested examples are now included in summary for failing\n
  \  examples\n\n * `context` is now an alias for `describe`\n\n## Changes in 1.1.1\n\n
  * Specs from Test.Hspec.Monadic has been renamed to Spec.  For backward\n   compatibility
  Specs is still kept as an alias.\n\n## Changes in 1.1.0\n\n### The reason for pending
  examples is now optional\n\nWith this change, both of the following code snippets
  work.\n\n```haskell\nit \"some behavior\" $\n  pending  -- no reason given\n```\n\n```haskell\nit
  \"some other behavior\" $\n  pending \"some reason\"\n```\n\n### Hspec does not
  rely on ExistentialQuantification anymore\n\n### The type used to represent specs
  is now abstract\n\nThis should give more useful error messages when adapting old
  specs that use\nthe non-monadic API for `hspec-1.0`/`hspec-1.1`.\n\n### Several
  internal types and functions have been deprecated\n\nThose are internal functions,
  and they will be removed/hidden with the next\nrelease.  If you use any of those,
  update your code.  If you really need them,\n[open a ticket](https://github.com/hspec/hspec/issues)
  and describe your use\ncase.\n\n## Changes in 1.0.0\n\n### Hspec now re-uses QuickCheck's
  property function\n\n`Test.Hspec.QuickCheck.property` is now simply a re-exports
  of\n`Test.QuickCheck.property`.  This has the advantage that you do not get a name\ncollision
  if you import both, `Test.Hspec.QuickCheck` and `Test.QuickCheck`.\n\n### Better
  support for nested specs\n\n*NOTE: This is a breaking change to the non-monadic
  API.  The monadic API is\nnot affected.*\n\nIn some situations parent descriptions
  for nested specs were not included in\nthe generated report.  Solving this required
  a change to the data structure\nthat is used to represent specs (it was not a proper
  tree, now it is).\n\n#### Updating specs that use the non-monadic API\n\nThe runner
  functions (`hspec`, `hspecB` and `hspecX`) now take a list of\ndescriptions.\n\nThe
  following works with `hspec-0.9`, but not with `hspec-1.0`.\n\n```haskell\nmain
  = hspecX $\n  describe \"reverse\" [\n    it \"reverses a list\" $\n      reverse
  [1, 2, 3] == [3, 2, 1],\n\n    it \"gives the original list, if applied twice\"
  $ property $\n      \\xs -> reverse (reverse xs) == (xs :: [Int])\n  ]\n\n```\n\nFor
  `hspec-1.0`, you need to wrap it into a list.\n\n```haskell\nmain = hspecX [\n    describe
  \"reverse\" [\n      it \"reverses a list\" $\n        reverse [1, 2, 3] == [3,
  2, 1],\n\n      it \"gives the original list, if applied twice\" $ property $\n
  \       \\xs -> reverse (reverse xs) == (xs :: [Int])\n    ]\n  ]\n```\n\nSpecs
  consisting of several *desribes*, combined with `descriptions`, continue\nto work
  unchanged.  But `descriptions` is now a noop, and it will be removed in\na future
  release.  So it is a good idea to drop it.\n\nThe following works with both `hspec-0.9`
  and `hspec-1.0`.\n\n```haskell\nmain = hspecX $ descriptions [  -- descriptions
  is redundant\n    describe \"Foo\" [\n      it \"has some behavior\" True\n    ]\n
  \ , describe \"Bar\" [\n      it \"has some behavior\" True\n    ]\n  ]\n```\n\nBut
  the following is recommended instead.\n\n```haskell\nmain = hspecX [\n    describe
  \"Foo\" [\n      it \"has some behavior\" True\n    ]\n  , describe \"Bar\" [\n
  \     it \"has some behavior\" True\n    ]\n  ]\n```\n\n### A new monadic API for
  custom Formatters\n\nFor all the details, have a look at the [docs]\n(http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/hspec/latest/doc/html/Test-Hspec-Formatters.html).\n\n\n###
  The total time required to run a spec is now included in the summary\n\nIn addition
  to the used CPU time, the total time required to run a spec is now\ninclude in the
  summary.  This is useful for specs that do non-CPU-intensive\nstuff, or fork subprocesses.\n"
