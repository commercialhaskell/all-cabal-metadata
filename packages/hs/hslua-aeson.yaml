  # Changelog

  `hslua-aeson` uses [PVP Versioning][].

  ## hslua-aeson-2.3.0.1

  Released 2023-03-13.

  -   Relax upper bound for hslua-marshalling, allow version 2.3.

  ## hslua-aeson-2.3.0

  Released 2023-02-21.

  -   The `peekValue` peeker now checks for a `__toaeson` metafield
      or `__tojson` metamethod and uses them to compute the `Value`
      of an object:

      The `__toaeson` metafield, if set, must be a function pushed
      via `pushToAeson`. That function is called on a given object,
      and the returned *Value* becomes the result of calling
      `peekValue`.

      Likewise, the `__tojson` metamethod must be a function that
      returns a valid JSON string. The result in that case is the
      decoded string.

      If both, `__toaeson` and `__tojson` are set, then `__toaeson`
      takes precedent.

  -   The test suite now has *tasty-hunit* as an additional
      dependency.

  ## hslua-aeson-2.2.1

  Released 2022-06-23.

  -   Export `jsonarray`, which is the name of the registry slot
      holding the metatable given to array tables. Setting the
      corresponding registry value will affect all newly created
      array values.

  ## hslua-aeson-2.2.0.1

  Released 2022-06-16.

  -   Relaxed upper bound for mtl, allowing mtl-2.3.

  -   Relaxed upper bound for aeson, allowing aeson-2.1.

  ## hslua-aeson-2.2.0

  Released 2022-02-19.

  -   Relaxed upper bound for hslua-core and hslua-marshalling,
      allowing version 2.2 of both packages.

  ## hslua-aeson-2.1.0

  Released 2022-01-29.

  -   Update to hslua 2.1.

  -   Encode `null` as light userdata: The `NULL` pointer wrapped
      into a light userdata is used to encode the JSON null value.

      The `pushNull` function has been removed; use
      `pushValue Null` instead.

  -   Types that are instances of `ToJSON` and `FromJSON` can be
      marshalled/unmarshalled by using the new functions
      `pushViaJSON` and `peekViaJSON`, respectively.

  -   The functions `peekVector`, `pushVector`, `peekScientific`,
      `pushScientific`, `peekKeyMap`, and `pushKeyMap` are
      considered an implementation detail and are no longer
      exported.

  -   Array elements are now marked with a metatable. This avoids
      the need for an extra `0` element in the table and offers
      flexibility for users who want to give special behavior to
      lists. The newly exported value `jsonarray` contains the name
      of the registry slot under which the metatable is stored. The
      table can be modified or replaced as required.

  ## hslua-aeson-2.0.1

  Released 2021-12-28.

  -   Restored compatibility with aeson 1.5.

  ## hslua-aeson-2.0.0

  Released 2021-12-17.

  -   Changed module name from `Foreign.Lua.Aeson` to
      `HsLua.Aeson`.

  -   The Peekable and Pushable instances have been removed. The
      package no longer defines orphaned instances.

  -   Updated hslua and aeson to the respective 2.0 version.

  ## hslua-aeson-1.0.3.1

  Released 2020-10-16.

  -   Allow hslua-1.3.\*.

  ## hslua-aeson-1.0.3

  Released 2020-08-15.

  -   Relaxed version constraint for hslua, allowing `hslua-1.2.*`.

  ## hslua-aeson-1.0.2

  Released 2020-05-28

  -   Relaxed version constraint for aeson, allowing `aeson-1.5.*`.

  -   Update CI tests to check with GHC versions 8.0 through 8.10.
      Compilation with GHC 7.10 is no longer tested.

  -   Bump to stackage LTS-14.

  ## hslua-aeson-1.0.1

  Released 2020-04-03

  -   Relax version constraint for packages hashable and hslua,
      allow `hashable-1.3` and `hslua-1.1.*`.

  ## hslua-aeson-1.0.0

  Released 2019-09-24.

  -   Update to hslua 1.0.0

  -   Function `registerNull` has been replaced by `pushNull`.

      Using `pushNull` has the advantage that users wonâ€™t have to
      remember to register a special variable. Users who need a
      global variable can set it by running

            pushNull
            setglobal "HSLUA_AESON_NULL"

  ## hslua-aeson-0.3.0

  Released 2017-08-18.

  -   Update to hslua 0.8.0.

  ## hslua-aeson-0.2.0

  Not publicly released.

  -   Update to hslua 0.6.0.

  ## hslua-aeson-0.1.0.4

  Released 2017-04-17.

  -   Ensure compatibility with hslua 0.5.0.

  ## hslua-aeson-0.1.0.0

  Released 2017-02-03.

  -   Initial release.

  hslua-aeson
  ===========

  [![MIT License]](./LICENSE)

  Pushes and retrieves aeson `Value`s to and from the Lua stack.

  - `Null` values are encoded as light userdata containing the
    @NULL@ pointer.

  - Objects are converted to string-indexed tables.

  - Arrays are converted to sequence tables and are given a
    metatable. This makes it possible to distinguish between empty
    arrays and empty objects. The metatable is stored in the
    registry under key `HsLua JSON array`.

  - JSON numbers are converted to Lua numbers, i.e., `Lua.Number`;
    the exact C type may vary, depending on compile-time Lua
    configuration.
