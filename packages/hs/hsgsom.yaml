  = README

  This is the README file of hsgsom, a haskell library implementing the
  growing self organising map clustering algorithm.

  == The Algorithm

  The growing self organising map (GSOM) algorithm is a clustering algorithm
  working on a set of n-dimensional numeric input vectors. It's output is a
  network of nodes laid out in two dimensions where each node has a weight
  vector associated with it. This weight vector has the same dimension as the
  input vectors and is meant to be intepreted as a cluster center, i.e. it
  represents those input vectors whose distance to the node's weight vector
  is minimal when compared to the distance to the other nodes weight vectors.
  See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSOM> for an explanation of the algorithm.
  The algorithm was introduced in:

    Alahakoon, D., Halgamuge, S. K. and Sirinivasan, B. (2000)
    Dynamic Self Organizing Maps With Controlled Growth
    for Knowledge Discovery,
    IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks,
    Special Issue on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 11, pp 601-614.

  == License

  This package and its contents are licensed under the BSD 3 clause license.
  You should have received a file called LICENSE containing said license
  along with this package.

  == Versioning

  This README correponds to version 0.1.0 of hsgsom, so as you can see it is
  a very early version.
  Version numbers follow the pattern X.Y.Z and have the following meaning:

    - a change in Z corresponds to minor changes as in documentation changes
      or changes to the underlying implementation

    - a change in Y correponds to added functionality and/or backwards
      compatible interface changes/additions.

    - a change in X correpsonds to a major implementation change either
      drastically changing the algorithm behaviour or performance or
      changing the interface in a possibly not backwards compatible way.

  == Questions, Bugs, etc...

  If you think you have found a bug, or you have questions or suggestions
  or really anything to say about the package it would be greatly appreciated
  if you would drop me a note or an email.
  This is my very firt attempt at packaging and releasing a substantial amount
  my own code to the public and I'm eager to learn how to do thinks better.

  Thanks for using/looking at this package and have a nice day.
