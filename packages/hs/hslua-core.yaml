  # Changelog

  `hslua-core` uses [PVP Versioning][].

  ## hslua-core-2.3.2

  Released 2024-01-18.

  -   Relaxed upper bound for text, and bytestring, allowing
      text-2.1, and bytestring-0.12.

  ## hslua-core-2.3.1

  Released 2023-03-17.

  -   New module *HsLua.Core.Debug*: the module provides bindings to
      a subset of functions of the Lua debug interface. Currently
      the module only exports `getupvalue` and `setupvalue`, both of
      which are also re-exported from *HsLua.Core*.

  ## hslua-core-2.3.0

  Released 2023-03-13.

  -   The functions `loadfile`, `dofile`, and `dofileTrace` now
      expect the argument to be of type `Maybe FilePath`. The
      functions load from *stdin* when the argument is `Nothing`.

  -   Added `setwarnf'` for simple warning messgae handling: The
      built-in method of setting a warn function is flexible but not
      straight-forward to use. The new `setwarnf'` function allows
      to set a Haskell action as a warning hook: the default warning
      behavior is kept in place, but, in addition to the default
      action, the hook is called on the concatenated warning
      messages. This can be used to plug Lua warnings into an
      application specific Haskell reporting system.

  -   Export `GCManagedState`, `newGCManagedState`,
      `closeGCManagedState`, and `withGCManagedState` from
      `HsLua.Core`.

  ## hslua-core-2.2.1

  Released 2022-06-19.

  -   Ensure that loadfile works with umlauts in filepath: The OS
      does not necessarily expect filenames to be UTF-8 encoded,
      especially Windows. On non-Windows systems, the current file
      system encoding is now used to convert filenames to C
      strings. On Windows, the `CP_ACP` codepage is used, as
      required by the Windows API.

  -   GC managed Lua state: Add new type `GCManagedState` and
      functions `newGCManagedState`, `closeGCManagedState`, and
      `withGCManagedState`. These allow to create and use a Lua
      state in flexible ways in that it does not require the state
      to be closed explicitly. The state will be closed when the
      respective variable is collected.

  -   Require lua-2.2.1.

  -   Relax upper bound for mtl, allow mtl-2.3.

  ## hslua-core-2.2.0

  Released 2022-02-19.

  -    Use lua-2.2.0, which requires Lua 5.4.

  -    Rename `newuserdata` to `newuserdatauv` and let it take the
       number of associated uservalues as an additional argument.

       Similarly, `newhsuserdata` is now `newhsuserdatauv`.

  -    Rename `getuservalue` and `setuservalue` to `getiuservalue`
       and `setiuservalue`, respectively. Like both functions now
       take an extra argument specifying the number of the uservalue
       that should be retrieved or set.

       It is now possible for `setiuservalue` to fail, so it returns
       a boolean to indicate whether the action was successful.

  -    The `GCControl` type has been updated to match the new gc
       control:

       -   The GCStep constructor takes an argument "stepsize";
       -   constructors GCGen and GCInc have been added;
       -   constructors GCSetPause and GCSetStepMul have been removed.

  ## hslua-core-2.1.0

  Released 29-01-2022.

  -   The functions `rawget`, `rawgeti`, and `getref` now return the
      type of the value that was pushed to the stack.

  -   A new function `checkstack'` is added to HsLua.Core.Auxiliary
      and exported from the main HsLua.Core module. The function
      throws an exception if the stack cannot be grown to
      accommodate a given number of elements; it is similar to
      `luaL_checkstack`.

  -   Added function `requiref`, which safely wraps the unsafe
      `luaL_requiref` function.

  -   New functions `pcallTrace`, `callTrace`, `dostringTrace`, and
      `dofileTrace`: behaves like the respective unsuffixed
      functions, but use a message handler that creates a stack
      traceback on error.

  -   Added function `rotate`, wrapping `lua_rotate`.

  -   Package helper `requirehs` signature changed to

      ``` haskell
      requirehs :: LuaError e
                => Name                 -- ^ modname
                -> (Name -> LuaE e ())  -- ^ openf
                -> LuaE e ()
      ```

      The function creating and pushing the module value now takes
      the module name as an argument. It also behaves more like
      `luaL_requiref` in that it reloads the module if the value in
      the LOADED table is falsy.

  ## hslua-core-2.0.0.2

  Released 2021-11-03.

  -   Fixed output of `pushTypeMismatchError` when there is no value
      at the given index. Previously the function would report the
      value as type `string` and now reports it as `no value`.

  ## hslua-core-2.0.0.1

  Released 2021-10-29.

  -   Fixed bug in pushTypeMismatchError. The function did not use
      an absolute stack index in one place, which sometimes lead to
      incorrect actual types being reported.

  ## hslua-core-2.0.0

  Released 2021-10-21.

  -   Error handling has been reworked completely. The type of
      exceptions used and handled by HsLua is now exposed to the
      type system. The type `Lua` makes use of a default error type.
      Custom error handling can be implemented by using the `LuaE`
      type with an exception type that is an instance of class
      `LuaError`.

  -   Added new module HsLua.Core.Userdata. It contains thin
      wrappers around the functions available for creating
      Haskell-value-wrapping userdata objects.

  -   Added new module HsLua.Core.Closures, containing functions to
      expose Haskell functions to Lua.

  -   Reverted to using the auxlib `luaL_loadfile` function to load
      a Lua file. Previously files were opened and read in Haskell,
      but some functionality of the auxlib function was missing.

  ## hslua-core-1.0.0

  Released 2021-02-27.

  ==========

  Basic building blocks to interface Haskell and Lua in a
  Haskell-idiomatic style.

  Overview
  --------

  [Lua][] is a small, well-designed, embeddable scripting language.
  It has become the de-facto default to make programs extensible and
  is widely used everywhere from servers over games and desktop
  applications up to security software and embedded devices. This
  package provides the basic building blocks for coders to embed Lua
  into their programs.

  This package is part of [HsLua][], a Haskell framework built
  around the embeddable scripting language [Lua][].

  Interacting with Lua
  --------------------

  HsLua core provides the `Lua` type to define Lua operations. The
  operations are executed by calling `run`. A simple “Hello, World”
  program, using the Lua `print` function, is given below:

  ``` haskell
  import HsLua.Core.Lua as Lua

  main :: IO ()
  main = Lua.run prog
    where
      prog :: Lua ()
      prog = do
        Lua.openlibs  -- load Lua libraries so we can use 'print'
        Lua.getglobal "print"            -- push print function
        Lua.pushstring "Hello, World!"   -- push string argument
        Lua.call
          (NumArgs 1)    -- number of arguments passed to the function
          (NumResults 0) -- number of results expected
                         -- as return values
  ```

  ### The Lua stack

  Lua’s API is stack-centered: most operations involve pushing
  values to the stack or receiving items from the stack. E.g.,
  calling a function is performed by pushing the function onto the
  stack, followed by the function arguments in the order they should
  be passed to the function. The API function `call` then invokes
  the function with given numbers of arguments, pops the function
  and parameters off the stack, and pushes the results.

      ,----------.
      |  arg 3   |
      +----------+
      |  arg 2   |
      +----------+
      |  arg 1   |
      +----------+                  ,----------.
      | function |    call 3 1      | result 1 |
      +----------+   ===========>   +----------+
      |          |                  |          |
      |  stack   |                  |  stack   |
      |          |                  |          |

  This package provides all basic building blocks to interact with
  the Lua stack. If you’d like more comfort, please consider using
  the `hslua-packaging` and `hslua-classes` packages.

  Error handling
  --------------

  Errors and exceptions must always be caught and converted when
  passing language boundaries. The exception type which can be
  handled is encoded as the type `e` in the monad `LuaE e`. Only
  exceptions of this type may be thrown; throwing different
  exceptions across language boundaries will lead to a program
  crash.

  Exceptions must support certain operations as defined by the
  `LuaError` typeclass. The class ensures that errors can be
  converted from and to Lua values, and that a new exception can be
  created from a String message.
