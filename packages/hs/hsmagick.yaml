description: "This is an incomplete set of FFI bindings for the GraphicsMagick\nlibrary.
  You will need to install GraphicsMagick first -- see:\n   \n   http://www.graphicsmagick.org/\n\n\nI
  have tested these bindings with GraphicsMagick 1.2, which is\navailable as a \"snapshot\"
  from the above URL. The library will not\nbuild with GraphicsMagick 1.1.10 or 1.1.11
  (the most recent\nreleased version as of this writing). If it's important to you
  to\nbe able to use this library with a stable released version of\nGraphicsMagick,
  let me know.\n\nThe Haddock documentation only includes type signatures so far,
  and\nthat's not good enough. However, the API calls should mostly map onto\nthose
  documented at:\n\n   http://www.graphicsmagick.org/www/api.html\n\nTests can be
  found in:\n   Graphics.Transform.Magick.Test\nHowever, right now all tests are commented
  out since I didn't have\ntime to change them to use non-hard-wired file names. I
  hope it should\nbe obvious what my intentions were. A less ad hoc test framework
  would\nbe better yet.\n\nPlease submit bug reports, questions, feedback, complaints,
  praise,\nand especially patches (including documentation patches) to the \nmaintainer
  at:\n\n     vincent_AT_xenbox.fr\n\nI did a lot of this work during the second Haskell
  Hackathon (Hac II\n'07) in Freiburg in September 2007. I'd like to thank all the\nattendees
  at Hac II for their moral support, particularly Duncan\nCoutts for help with the
  FFI, as well as: Mark Jones, the members of\nthe Portland Functional Programming
  Study Group, and David MacIver,\nfor their encouragement.\n\n  -- Tim Chevalier\n
  \    Portland, Oregon\n     April 6, 2008\n\n=== Contributors ===\n\nThanks to \"nonowarn\",
  \"Steffen Siering\" for contributing patches.\n\n"
