  # I2C access for Haskell and Linux
  ![I2C interface](https://i.imgur.com/MSWScyV.jpg)

  This library provides a Haskell interface to I2C buses
  on Linux via  /dev/i2c-[n].
  It wraps the libi2c c-library, which is included as c-source,
  and works with every I2C interface that is supported by the Linux kernel.

  ## Disclaimer
  PCs and laptops use internal I2C buses to control various hardware functions.
  Incorrect use of the I2C interface can cause irreversible damage to
  your PC or laptop.
  Use this library with an external I2C interface (e.g. USB dongle)
  and double-check, that the /dev/i2c-[n] file belongs to that external interface.

  ## Hardware
  This library should work with every I2C interface
  that is supported by the Linux kernel.
  I test and use this library with an external I2C-Tiny-USB adapter.
  The [I2C-Tiny-USB](https://github.com/harbaum/I2C-Tiny-USB)
  project consists of an AVR based hardware, an AVR firmware
  and a Linux kernel driver.
  The popular USBASP AVR programmers, that are available for ca $2,
  are compatible with I2C-Tiny-USB hardware.
  A firmware update is all that is needed to turn a USBASP AVR programmer
  into an I2C-Tiny-USB interface.
  (Note that the i2c_tiny_usb Linux kernel driver is broken in Linux 4.9 and Linux 4.11. But it works with this [patch](https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9711919).

  ##Examples
  The library contains an example for reading barometer and compass data
  from an IMU (inertial measurement unit).
  Note that this example DOES NOT WORK unless you have the this specific
  IMU hardware device connected to your I2C bus.
