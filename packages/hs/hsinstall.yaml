  # hsinstall


  ## Synopsis

  Pack a haskell project into a deployable directory structure


  ## Description

  ### OVERVIEW

  hsinstall is a tool for installing a Haskell software project into a directory
  structure for deployment. It builds upon the `stack install` command and adds
  these features:

  - Copies the `LICENSE` file into `<PREFIX>/share/<PROJECT-NAME>/doc`
  - Copies the contents of a static directory stucture in your project (named
    `hsinstall`) into the destination prefix directory. This can contain
    additional binaries or scripts, resources, documentation, etc. (more on this
    later in TEMPLATE DIRECTORY)
  - Optionally builds an AppDir directory structure for the project and produces
    an [AppImage](https://appimage.org/) binary

  To use hsinstall, it will be necessary to have the Haskell stack tool on your PATH:
  https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/

  If the AppImage features are desired, you must have these tools on your PATH:
  linuxdeploy: https://github.com/linuxdeploy/linuxdeploy/releases,
  linuxdeploy-plugin-appimage: https://github.com/linuxdeploy/linuxdeploy-plugin-appimage/releases

  Running hsinstall on a project for the first time and with no arguments will produce this in . :

      AppDir/
        usr/
          bin/  <-- All binaries in the project
          share/
            <PROJECT-NAME>/
              doc/
                LICENSE

  The -p,--prefix switch allows you to set a prefix other than `AppDir/usr`. This
  could be anywhere, like `myproject-2.3` or `/usr/local` or `/opt`

  In addition, if an `hsinstall` directory exists, its contents will be copied
  into the prefix before build and install. See TEMPLATE DIRECTORY below for more
  info on this.

  ### APPIMAGE CREATION

  The -i,--mk-appimage switch will change the default prefix to `EXE.AppDir/usr`
  and only the specified EXE will be installed into `<PREFIX>/bin`, AppImages are
  intended to be made for exactly one binary.

  If .desktop and .svg files are not found in the hsinstall directory, defaults
  will be created for you and placed in the correct subdirs. Check these files
  into source control for future builds.

  The default `.desktop` file Categories will be populated with 'Utility;'. We
  recommend adjusting this using the XDG list of registered categories:
  https://specifications.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/apa.html

  If your application is a command-line program, append a line containing this to
  the end of the default `.desktop` file: 'Terminal=true'

  If your application isn't a command-line program, we recommend using a proper
  icon instead of the hsinstall default, which is a command shell icon.

  For more info on AppImage: https://appimage.org/

  ### TEMPLATE DIRECTORY

  If present, hsinstall will copy the contents of the `hsinstall` template
  directory into `<PREFIX>`. Here's an explanation of the hsinstall directory
  contents:

      hsinstall/
        bin/  <-- Put additional binaries and scripts to be deployed here
        share/
          applications/  <-- Only for AppImage
            <EXE>.desktop  <-- Will be generated by first-time AppImage creation attempt
          <PROJECT-NAME>/  <-- Only needed if you have resources
            resources/  <-- Put data files your software will need at runtime here
          icons/  <-- Only for AppImage
            hicolor/
              scalable/
                apps/
                  <EXE>.svg  <-- Will be generated by first-time AppImage creation attempt

  In order to locate data files at runtime, including resources, the hsinstall
  project includes a library to construct the share path relative to the
  executable. See [this source code](https://github.com/dino-/hsinstall/blob/master/src/lib/HSInstall/Paths.hs)
  for help with integrating this into your app.


  ## Development

  Browse [the source](https://github.com/dino-/hsinstall)

  Get source with git and build

      $ git clone https://github.com/dino-/hsinstall.git
      $ cd hsinstall
      $ stack build
      $ stack haddock --no-haddock-deps hsinstall

  If you have the abovementioned `linuxdeploy-*` programs on your path, we can do
  something *really* cool. Use this freshly-built hsinstall to package itself
  into an AppImage:

      $ stack exec hsinstall -- --mk-appimage hsinstall

  And you should see an `hsinstall-y.z-x86_64.AppImage` binary in `.`

  Tip: Use `git clean -df` to blow away untracked things like the AppDir and
  AppImage artifacts.
