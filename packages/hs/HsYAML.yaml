  ## 0.2.0.0

  This release incorporates the work from [Vijay Tadikamalla's GSOC 2019 Project](https://vijayphoenix.github.io/blog/gsoc-the-conclusion/).
  Highlights of this major release include support for emitting YAML as
  well as providing direct access to source locations throughout the
  parsing pipeline for improved error reporting.

  * Changes in `Data.YAML` module
      * YAML 1.2 Schema encoders ([#21](https://github.com/haskell-hvr/HsYAML/pull/21))
      * New `ToYAML` class for encoding Haskell Data-types from which YAML nodes can be constructed ([#20](https://github.com/haskell-hvr/HsYAML/pull/20))
          * New functions like `encodeNode`, `encodeNode'` for constructing AST
          * New functions like `encode`, `encode1`, `encodeStrict`, `encode1Strict` for supporting typeclass-based dumping
          * Some ToYAML instances and other api
      * Modify `typeMismatch` function to show error source location in error messages ([#19](https://github.com/haskell-hvr/HsYAML/pull/19))
      * Provide location-aware 'failAtNode' alternative to 'fail'

  * Changes in `Data.YAML.Event` module
      * Preserve and round-trip Comments at Event level([#24](https://github.com/haskell-hvr/HsYAML/pull/24))
          * New  `Comment` Event to preserve comments while parsing
          * Some additional implementations to preserve and round-trip comments
      * Fix issue [#22](https://github.com/haskell-hvr/HsYAML/issues/22)
      * New `EvPos` type for recording event and their corresponding position ([#19](https://github.com/haskell-hvr/HsYAML/pull/19))
      * Preserve Flow Mapping and Flow sequence ([#18](https://github.com/haskell-hvr/HsYAML/pull/18))
      * Features to preserve Literal/Folded ScalarStyle ([#15](https://github.com/haskell-hvr/HsYAML/pull/15))
          * New `Chomp` type denoting Block Chomping Indicator
          * New `IndentOfs` type denoting Block Indentation Indicator
      * New `NodeStyle` type denoting flow/block style
      * `Event(SequenceStart,MappingStart)` constructors now record `NodeStyle`
      * `Style` type renamed to `ScalarType`
      * New `writeEvents` and `writeEventsText` function
      * `Event(DocumentStart)` now records YAML directive
      * Event parser now rejects duplicate/unsupported YAML/TAG
        directives as mandated by the YAML 1.2 specification

  * Move some schema related definitions from `Data.YAML` into the new `Data.YAML.Schema` module

  * Make `decode`, `decode1`, `decodeStrict`, `decode1Strict`, `decodeNode`, and `decodeNode'` treat
    duplicate keys (under the respective YAML schema) in YAML mappings
    as a loader-error (controllable via new
    `schemaResolverMappingDuplicates` schema property)

  * Define `Generic` and `NFData` instances for most types

  * Fix `X38W` testcase ([#13](https://github.com/haskell-hvr/HsYAML/issues/13), [#14](https://github.com/haskell-hvr/HsYAML/issues/14))

  ### 0.1.1.3

  * Fix bug in float regexp being too lax in the JSON and Core schema ([#7](https://github.com/hvr/HsYAML/issues/7))
  * Remove dependency on `dlist`

  ### 0.1.1.2

  * Tolerate BOM at *each* `l-document-prefix` (rather than only at the first one encountered in a YAML stream)
  * Workaround broken `mtl-2.2.2` bundled in GHC 8.4.1 ([#1](https://github.com/hvr/HsYAML/issues/1))
  * Relax to GPL-2.0-or-later

  ### 0.1.1.1

  * Reject (illegal) non-scalar code-points in UTF-32 streams
  * Tolerate BOM at start of stream
  * Disambiguate choice in `l-any-document` production regarding token separation of `c-directives-end`
  * Fix `c-indentation-indicator(n)` grammar production when
    auto-detecting indentation in the presence of empty leading lines;
    also reject (illegal) auto-indent-level scalars with leading
    more-indented all-space lines
  * Complete character escape rules for double-quoted scalars
  * Minor optimizations

  ### 0.1.1.0

  * `Data.YAML` module promoted from `TrustWorthy` to `Safe`
  * Add `FromYAML Natural` instance
  * Add `MonadFail`, `Alternative`, and `MonadPlus` instances for `Data.YAML.Parser`
  * Add `Data.YAML.decodeStrict` function
  * Export `Data.YAML.typeMismatch` helper function

  ## 0.1.0.0

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  @HsYAML@ is a [YAML 1.2](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) processor, i.e. a library for parsing and serializing YAML documents.

  Features of @HsYAML@ include:

  * Pure Haskell implementation with small dependency footprint and emphasis on strict compliance with the [YAML 1.2 specification](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html).
  * Direct decoding to native Haskell types via (@aeson@-inspired) typeclass-based API (see "Data.YAML").
  * Allows round-tripping while preserving ordering, anchors, and comments at Event-level.
  * Support for constructing custom YAML node graph representation (including support for cyclic YAML data structures).
  * Support for the standard (untyped) /Failsafe/, (strict) /JSON/, and (flexible) /Core/ \"schemas\" providing implicit typing rules as defined in the YAML 1.2 specification (including support for user-defined custom schemas; see "Data.YAML.Schema").
  * Support for emitting YAML using /Failsafe/, (strict) /JSON/, and (flexible) /Core/ \"schemas\" (including support for user-defined custom encoding schemas; see "Data.YAML.Schema").
  * Event-based API resembling LibYAML's Event-based API (see "Data.YAML.Event").
  * Low-level API access to lexical token-based scanner (see "Data.YAML.Token").

  See also the <//hackage.haskell.org/package/HsYAML-aeson HsYAML-aeson> package which allows to decode and encode YAML by leveraging @aeson@'s 'FromJSON' and 'ToJSON' instances.
