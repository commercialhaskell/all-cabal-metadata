  HSNTP - Haskell Simple Network Time Protocol

  Simple Network Time Protocol is a simple subset of NTP. This package
  includes Haskell libraries to use SNTP Protocol and small client and
  server implementations. The package contains everything needed for a compilation.

  Compiling and installation

     Download and unpack.
     Build and install through Cabal as for other Haskell packages:

          runhaskell Setup configure --user --prefix=$HOME
          runhaskell Setup build
          runhaskell Setup install --user

    (You may want to remove the --user flag when installing as root.)


  Dependencies

  The library depends on GHC, but porting should not be too hard as the
  code is quite short.


  sntpdate server

  Sntpdate fetches the date from an (s)ntp-server and tries
  to set the local clock.


  sntpd

  Sntpd serves the local clock to interested (s)ntp clients.
  The program forks into the background. Needs a wrapper
  for non-root operation as ntp runs in a privileged port.
