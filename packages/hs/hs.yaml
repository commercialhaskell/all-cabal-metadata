  # hs: a Haskell installation-manager broker

  Build managers like `cabal-install` and `stack` need access to installed toolchains managed by
  installation managers like `stack` and `ghcup`. `hs` keeps track of the toolchains installed by
  the managers and locates them on request for the build managers.

  ```bash
  $ hs whereis ghc-8.10.4
  /Users/chris/.stack/programs/x86_64-osx/ghc-8.10.4
  ```

  We have a prototype integration for `stack` (watch this space) and a collection of wrappers for
  each tool that `cabal-install` can use, like the following for ghc-pkg-8.10.4:

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  hs run ghc-pkg-8.10.4 --ask-install -- "$@"
  ```

  Used in this way, `hs` will try to locate `ghc-pkg-8.10.4`, asking the user if to proceed with an
  installation with the preferred installation manager (`stack` or `ghcup`) if it cannot locate the
  installation.

  To list the installation in your development environment try this:

  ```
  $ stack list
  8.6.5      stack /Users/chris/.stack/programs/x86_64-osx/ghc-8.6.5
  8.8.3      stack /Users/chris/.stack/programs/x86_64-osx/ghc-8.8.3
  8.8.4      stack /Users/chris/.stack/programs/x86_64-osx/ghc-8.8.4
  8.10.4     stack /Users/chris/.stack/programs/x86_64-osx/ghc-8.10.4
  8.10.5     ghcup /Users/chris/.ghcup/ghc/8.10.5
  9.0.1      ghcup /Users/chris/.ghcup/ghc/9.0.1
  ```

  To configure the defaults you can do these.

  ```bash
  # ghcup to carry out installations requested from the build tools
  $ hs use ghcup stack
  # ask before installing any missing toolchains
  $ hs use-install-mode ask-install
  # specify the deafult toolchain when no version specified
  $ hs use-compiler 8.10.4
  ```

  To dump a new set of wrappers into `~/.hs/bin` with your preferred `ask-install` installation
  option:

  ```bash
  $ hs dump-ghc-wrappers ask-install
  ```

  With the path set up right your stack and cabal-install projects should play nicely together.

  Share and Enjoy!
