  Fast TagSoup parser. Speeds of 20-200MB/sec were observed.

  Works only with strict bytestrings.

  This library is intended to be used in conjunction with the original @tagsoup@ package:

  > import Text.HTML.TagSoup hiding (parseTags, renderTags)
  > import Text.HTML.TagSoup.Fast.Utf8Only

  Besides speed @fast-tagsoup@ correctly handles HTML @\<script\>@ and @\<style\>@ tags and converts tags to lower case.
  This fork purposefully removes support for parsing non-utf8 documents, to avoid dependency on text-icu.
  If you need to handle other encodings, refer to the original <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/fast-tagsoup>

  This parser is used in production in BazQux Reader feeds and comments crawler.
