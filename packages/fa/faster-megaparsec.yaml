changelog: "# Changelog for `faster-megaparsec`\n\n## 0.1.0.1\n\nTest suite comparing
  `SimpleParser` against `Parsec`.\n\n# 0.1.1\n\nChanged the definition of `takeP_`
  to honour the spec\n(fail if the input stream is shorter than requested). \n\nRe-factored
  the test suite to include a benchmark.\n\n# 0.1.2\n\nIncluded a benchmark for CSV
  parsing. \nSpeedup on 100000 lines is roughly \n0.7x against ParsecT and \n0.6x
  against Cassava \nwhen decoding only few columns of a broad table.\n"

description: "# faster-megaparsec\n\nThis package defines a MonadParsec instance for
  \n(a type isomorphic to) `StateT s Maybe`\nwhere `s` is a Megaparsec Stream type
  such as `String`, `Text` or `ByteString`.\nThis parser can be faster than Cassava
  for csv parsing \nbut at the cost of no error information whatsoever. \n\nIf, however,
  you construct your parser in a generic `MonadParsec` fashion, \nthen with the help
  of `Text.Megaparsec.Simple.tryFast` \nyou can first attempt to specialize and run
  the fast parser \nsupplied by this package and only on parse error specialize \nthe
  parser to `ParsecT` and parse again, yielding an informative \nerror message.  \nThis
  buys you speed in the smooth case of successful parsing \nat the cost of double
  parse when something goes wrong. \n\nBeware that the behaviour of a `SimpleParser`
  can differ from its `Parsec` sibling \nbecause \n\n * `SimpleParser` is always backtracking
  since it does not know whether it has consumed tokens,\n * any fancy parsing that
  relies on inspecting parser state components such as offset will not work as intended.\n\n"
