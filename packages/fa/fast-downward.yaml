changelog: |
  # 0.2.0.0 -- 2019-11-29

  * Support GHC 8.8
  * Improve FastDownward.Exec to support predefining evaluators
  * Added FastDownward.Exec.bjqlp, which is a good starting point for configuring
    Fast Downward.
  * Add FastDownward.requiresAxioms, to see if a Test requires a search engine
    with axiom support.
  * Rewrite the `Effect` type to be considerably faster. The new implementation
    uses continuations to minimally compute the set of all concrete effects.
  * Enforce `writeVar v >=> readVar v === return`

  # 0.1.1.0 -- 2019-01-09

  * Support `containers-0.6`.
  * Added `instance MonadFail Effect`
  * Bumped `base` upper bound to `< 4.13`
  * Bumped `list-t` lower bound to `>= 1.0.2` (this is necessary for internal
    reasons related to generalised newtype deriving)

  # 0.1.0.1 -- 2019-01-02

  * Removed a stray `putStrLn`.

  # 0.1.0.0

  * Initial release!
