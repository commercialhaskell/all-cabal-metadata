description: |2-

  Fast TagSoup parser. Speeds of 20-200MB/sec were observed.

  Works only with strict bytestrings.

  This library is intended to be used in conjunction with the original @tagsoup@ package:

  > import Text.HTML.TagSoup hiding (parseTags, renderTags)
  > import Text.HTML.TagSoup.Fast

  Besides speed @fast-tagsoup@ correctly handles HTML @\<script\>@ and @\<style\>@ tags, converts tags to lower case and can decode non UTF-8 XML for you.

  This parser is used in production in BazQux Reader feeds and comments crawler.
