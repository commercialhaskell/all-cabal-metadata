description: ! "# fast-combinatorics\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vmchale/fast-combinatorics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vmchale/fast-combinatorics)\n\nThis
  is a library for fast combinatorics using ATS. As such, make sure\na C compiler
  is installed, however it may not work on windows.\n\nCurrently it is a work-in-progress,
  being somewhat constrained by the fact that I have\nyet to figure out how to share
  arbitrary-precision types between ATS and Haskell.\n\n## Benchmarks\n\n| Computation
  | Version (ATS/Haskell) | Time |\n| ----------- | --------------------- | ---- |\n|
  `12!` | ATS | 9.301 ns |\n| `12!` | Haskell | 27.84 ns |\n| ``13 `choose` 4`` |
  ATS | 12.28 ns |\n| ``13 `choose` 4`` | Haskell | 28.38 ns |\n| `isPrime 2017` |
  ATS | 118.9 ns |\n| `isPrime 2017` | Haskell | 497.3 ns |\n| `3 ^ 7` | ATS | 9.050
  ns |\n| `3 ^ 7` | Haskell | 37.02 ns |\n\n## Building\n\nThe Haskell library comes
  with the C bundled, however you may wish to build from\nsource if you are hacking
  on the library. To that end, you can install\n[stack](http://haskellstack.org/),
  [patscc](http://www.ats-lang.org/Downloads.html), and\n[pats-filter](https://github.com/Hibou57/PostiATS-Utilities)
  and build with\n\n```bash\n $ ./shake.hs\n```\n\nYou will also likely want to install\n[GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download.html)
  as well as\n[cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/).\n\n## Documentation\n\n###
  Using the ATS library\n\nOne of the nice things about a Haskell wrapper is that
  some of Haskell's\ntooling/libraries may be used. You may want to try the REPL:\n\n```bash\n
  $ cabal new-repl\n```\n\n### Using the Haskell library\n\nYou may wish to read the
  ATS source code for an indication of what sorts of\nthings ATS allows us to prove
  things about our programs, particularly proofs of\ntermination.\n\nThere are also
  a few caveats: note that all results and arguments\nmust be of the `Int` type. This
  unfortunate constraint will hopefully be fixed\nin the future, but right now it
  limits the usefulness of the library.\n"
