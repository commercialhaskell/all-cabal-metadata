  # fast-combinatorics

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vmchale/fast-combinatorics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vmchale/fast-combinatorics)

  This is a library for fast combinatorics using ATS. As such, make sure
  a C compiler is installed. It may not work on windows, so if you run into bugs
  building this please open an issue.

  ## Benchmarks

  | Computation | Version (ATS/Haskell) | Time |
  | ----------- | --------------------- | ---- |
  | `isPrime 2017` | ATS | 118.9 ns |
  | `isPrime 2017` | Haskell | 497.3 ns |
  | `φ(2016)` | ATS | 5.574 μs |
  | `φ(2016)` | Haskell | 177.3 μs |
  | `τ(3018)` | ATS | 7.962 μs |
  | `τ(3018)` | Haskell | 35.87 μs |

  ## Building

  The Haskell library comes with the C bundled, however you may wish to build from
  source if you are hacking on the library. To that end, you can install
  [stack](http://haskellstack.org/), [patsopt](http://www.ats-lang.org/Downloads.html), and
  [pats-filter](https://github.com/Hibou57/PostiATS-Utilities) and build with

  ```bash
   $ ./shake.hs
  ```

  You will also likely want to install
  [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download.html) as well as
  [cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/).

  ## Documentation

  ### Using the ATS library

  One of the nice things about a Haskell wrapper is that some of Haskell's
  tooling/libraries may be used. You may want to try the REPL:

  ```bash
   $ cabal new-repl
  ```

  ### Using the Haskell library

  You may wish to read the ATS source code for an indication of what sorts of
  things ATS allows us to prove things about our programs, particularly proofs of
  termination.
