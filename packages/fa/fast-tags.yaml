synopsis: Fast incremental vi and emacs tags.
changelog: ! '1.2.1


  * Minor updates to cabal file, comments, etc.


  1.2


  * Speedup thanks to <https://github.com/elaforge/fast-tags/pull/22>.

  Also many tags previously incorrectly marked as ''p'' Pattern are now

  correctly ''f'' Function.


  1.1.2:


  * Implement `--no-module-tags` command line parameter to optionally avoid

  tagging modules.


  1.1.1:


  * fix ''format'' output for vim


  1.1:


  * Decode UTF8 leniently, so non-UTF8 will no longer cause a crash.  Removed

  the --ignore-encoding-errors flag, since that''s the default behaviour now.


  1.0:


  * Merged a whole bunch of patches from Sergey Vinokurov.  Copy paste from

  <https://github.com/elaforge/fast-tags/pull/6>:


  * recognize more syntactic constructs (consider tests as specification of

  what''s handled)


  * add more tests


  * use tasty to organize tests


  * ability to produce emacs tags


  * handling of literate files


  * new mode to recursively traverse directory tree and search for haskell files


  * optionally ignore encoding errors during reading and skip offending files


  * ability to read \n-separated or \0-separated list of files from stdin

  and blazing-fast speed of tag generation is presevred


  0.0.6:


  * fix bug where class context in a class''s methods would be confused for the

  context of the class itself


  0.0.5:


  * Tags with the same name are sorted by their type: Function, Type,

  Constructor, Class, Module.


  0.0.4:


  * Fixed bug that prevented old tags from being filtered out.


  0.0.3:


  * Lots of speed ups, especially when given lots of files at once.


  * Support for type families and GADTs.


  * Support infix operators, multiple declarations per line, and fix various

  other bugs that missed or gave bad tags.
