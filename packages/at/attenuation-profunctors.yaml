  # attenuation-profunctors

  Attenuation support for `profunctors`.

  ## Overview

  This package provides functions for lifting `Attenuation`s across
  `Profunctor`s, along with entailments for obtaining the related instances.

  This is in a separate package from the rest of `attenuation` because
  `profunctors` is a very heavy dependency, and the core functionality doesn't
  need it.
