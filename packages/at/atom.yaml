description: |-
  Atom is a Haskell EDSL for designing hard realtime embedded software.
  Based on guarded atomic actions (similar to STM), Atom enables
  highly concurrent programming without the need for mutex locking.
  In addition, Atom performs compile-time task scheduling and generates code
  with deterministic execution time and constant memory use, simplifying the
  process of timing verification and memory consumption in hard realtime
  applications.
  Without mutex locking and run-time task scheduling, Atom eliminates
  the need and overhead of RTOSes for many embedded applications.
