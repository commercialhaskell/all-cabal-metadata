synopsis: Fast combinator parsing for bytestrings and text
changelog: ! "0.13.2.1\n\n* Improved performance of `Data.Attoparsec.Text.asciiCI`\n\n0.13.2.0\n\n*
  `pure` is now strict in `Position`\n\n0.13.1.0\n\n* `runScanner` now correctly returns
  the final state\n  (https://github.com/bos/attoparsec/issues/105).\n* `Parser`,
  `ZeptoT`, `Buffer`, and `More` now expose `Semigroup` instances.\n* `Parser`, and
  `ZeptoT` now expose `MonadFail` instances.\n\n0.13.0.2\n\n* Restore the fast specialised
  character set implementation for Text\n* Move testsuite from test-framework to tasty\n*
  Performance optimization of takeWhile and takeWhile1\n\n0.13.0.1\n\n* Fixed a bug
  in the implementations of inClass and notInClass for\n  Text (https://github.com/bos/attoparsec/issues/103)\n\n0.13.0.0\n\n*
  Made the parser type in the Zepto module a monad transformer\n  (needed by aeson's
  string unescaping parser).\n\n0.12.1.6\n\n* Fixed a case folding bug in the ByteString
  version of stringCI.\n\n0.12.1.5\n\n* Fixed an indexing bug in the new Text implementation
  of string,\n  reported by Michel Boucey.\n\n0.12.1.4\n\n* Fixed a case where the
  string parser would consume an unnecessary\n  amount of input before failing a match,
  when it could bail much\n  earlier (https://github.com/bos/attoparsec/issues/97)\n\n*
  Added more context to error messages\n  (https://github.com/bos/attoparsec/pull/79)\n\n0.12.1.3\n\n*
  Fixed incorrect tracking of Text lengths\n  (https://github.com/bos/attoparsec/issues/80)\n\n0.12.1.2\n\n*
  Fixed the incorrect tracking of capacity if the initial buffer was\n  empty (https://github.com/bos/attoparsec/issues/75)\n\n0.12.1.1\n\n*
  Fixed a data corruption bug that occurred under some circumstances\n  if a buffer
  grew after prompting for more input\n  (https://github.com/bos/attoparsec/issues/74)\n\n0.12.1.0\n\n*
  Now compatible with GHC 7.9\n\n* Reintroduced the Chunk class, used by the parsers
  package\n\n0.12.0.0\n\n* A new internal representation makes almost all real-world
  parsers\n  faster, sometimes by big margins.  For example, parsing JSON data\n  with
  aeson is now up to 70% faster.  These performance improvements\n  also come with
  reduced memory consumption and some new capabilities.\n\n* The new match combinator
  gives both the result of a parse and the\n  input that it matched.\n\n* The test
  suite has doubled in size.  This made it possible to switch\n  to the new internal
  representation with a decent degree of\n  confidence that everything was more or
  less working.\n\n* The benchmark suite now contains a small family of benchmarks
  taken\n  from real-world uses of attoparsec.\n\n* A few types that ought to have
  been private now are.\n\n* A few obsolete modules and functions have been marked
  as deprecated.\n  They will be removed from the next major release.\n\n0.11.3.0\n\n*
  New function scientific is compatible with rational, but parses\n  integers more
  efficiently (https://github.com/bos/aeson/issues/198)\n\n0.11.2.0\n\n* The new Chunk
  typeclass allows for some code sharing with Ed\n  Kmett's parsers package: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsers\n\n*
  New function runScanner generalises scan to return the final state\n  of the scanner
  as well as the input consumed.\n\n\n0.11.1.0\n\n* New dependency: the scientific
  package.  This allows us to parse\n  numbers much more efficiently.\n\n* peekWord8',
  peekChar': new primitive parsers that allow\n  single-character lookahead.\n"
