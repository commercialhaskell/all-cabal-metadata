  ## 0.8.5 [2024.02.17]
  * Allow building with GHC 9.10.

  ## 0.8.4 [2020.10.03]
  * Allow building with `base-4.15` (GHC 9.0).

  ## 0.8.3 [2019.05.02]
  * Allow the tests to build with `base-4.13` (GHC 8.8).
  * Require GHC 7.10 or later.

  ## 0.8.2 [2018.03.08]
  * Allow building with `base-4.11`.

  ## 0.8.1.1 [2017.12.10]
  * Bundle `testing/Fetch.hs` with the package tarball

  ## 0.8.1
  * Simplify `Setup.hs` to support `Cabal-2.0`/GHC 8.2
  * Properly link `store_load_barrier` and friends against the GHC RTS on Windows
    when using GHC 8.2 or later

  ## 0.8.0.4
  * Internal changes to support forthcoming GHC 8.0

  ## 0.8
  * Implements additional fetch primops available in GHC 7.10

  ## 0.7
  * This release adds support for GHC 7.10 and its expanded library of (now inline) primops.

  ## 0.6.1
  * This is a good version to use for GHC 7.8.3.  It includes portability and bug fixes
    and adds atomicModifyIORefCAS.

  ## 0.6.0.5
  * fix for GHC 7.8

  ## 0.6.0.1
  * minor ghc 7.8 fix

  ## 0.6
  * add atomicModifyIORefCAS, and bump due to prev bugfixes

  ## 0.5.0.2
  * IMPORTANT BUGFIXES - don't use earlier versions.  They have been marked deprecated.

  ## 0.5
  * Nix Data.Atomics.Counter.Foreign and the bits-atomic dependency.

  ## 0.4.1
  * Add advance support for GHC 7.8

  ## 0.4
  * Further internal changes, duplicate 'cas' routine well as barriers.
  * Add `fetchAddByteArrayInt`
  * Add an `Unboxed` counter variant that uses movable "ByteArray"s on the GHC heap.

  ## 0.3
  * Major internal change.  Duplicate the barrier code from the GHC RTS and thus
    enable support for executables that are NOT built with '-threaded'.

  ## 0.2.2.1
  * Minor, add warning.

  ## 0.2.2
  * Add more counters

  ## 0.2
  * Critical bugfix and add Counter.

  ## 0.1.0.2
  * disable profiling

  ## 0.1.0.0
  * initial release

description: |2-
   After GHC 7.4 a new `casMutVar#` primop became available, but it's
   difficult to use safely, because pointer equality is a highly
   unstable property in Haskell.  This library provides a safer method
   based on the concept of "Tickets".
  .
   Also, this library uses the "foreign primop" capability of GHC to
   add access to other variants that may be of
   interest, specifically, compare and swap inside an array.
  .
   Note that as of GHC 7.8, the relevant primops have been included in GHC itself.
   This library is engineered to work pre- and post-GHC-7.8, while exposing the
   same interface.
