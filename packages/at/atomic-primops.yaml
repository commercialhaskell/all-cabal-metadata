synopsis: A safe approach to CAS and other atomic ops in Haskell.
changelog: ! "## 0.8.2 [2018.03.08]\n* Allow building with `base-4.11`.\n\n## 0.8.1.1
  [2017.12.10]\n* Bundle `testing/Fetch.hs` with the package tarball\n\n## 0.8.1\n*
  Simplify `Setup.hs` to support `Cabal-2.0`/GHC 8.2\n* Properly link `store_load_barrier`
  and friends against the GHC RTS on Windows\n  when using GHC 8.2 or later\n\n##
  0.8.0.4\n* Internal changes to support forthcoming GHC 8.0\n\n## 0.8\n* Implements
  additional fetch primops available in GHC 7.10\n\n## 0.7\n* This release adds support
  for GHC 7.10 and its expanded library of (now inline) primops.\n\n## 0.6.1\n* This
  is a good version to use for GHC 7.8.3.  It includes portability and bug fixes\n
  \ and adds atomicModifyIORefCAS.\n\n## 0.6.0.5\n* fix for GHC 7.8\n\n## 0.6.0.1\n*
  minor ghc 7.8 fix\n\n## 0.6\n* add atomicModifyIORefCAS, and bump due to prev bugfixes\n\n##
  0.5.0.2\n* IMPORTANT BUGFIXES - don't use earlier versions.  They have been marked
  deprecated.\n\n## 0.5\n* Nix Data.Atomics.Counter.Foreign and the bits-atomic dependency.\n\n##
  0.4.1\n* Add advance support for GHC 7.8\n\n## 0.4\n* Further internal changes,
  duplicate 'cas' routine well as barriers.\n* Add `fetchAddByteArrayInt`\n* Add an
  `Unboxed` counter variant that uses movable \"ByteArray\"s on the GHC heap.\n\n##
  0.3\n* Major internal change.  Duplicate the barrier code from the GHC RTS and thus\n
  \ enable support for executables that are NOT built with '-threaded'.\n\n## 0.2.2.1\n*
  Minor, add warning.\n\n## 0.2.2\n* Add more counters\n\n## 0.2\n* Critical bugfix
  and add Counter.\n\n## 0.1.0.2\n* disable profiling\n\n## 0.1.0.0\n* initial release\n"

description: ! 'After GHC 7.4 a new `casMutVar#` primop became available, but it''s

  difficult to use safely, because pointer equality is a highly

  unstable property in Haskell.  This library provides a safer method

  based on the concept of "Tickets".


  Also, this library uses the "foreign primop" capability of GHC to

  add access to other variants that may be of

  interest, specifically, compare and swap inside an array.


  Note that as of GHC 7.8, the relevant primops have been included in GHC itself.

  This library is engineered to work pre- and post-GHC-7.8, while exposing the

  same interface.'
