description: ! "# attomail [![Hackage version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/attomail.svg?label=Hackage)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/attomail)\n\nMinimal
  mail delivery agent (MDA) for local mail with maildir support - a Haskell re-implementation
  of femtomail\n\n## quick installation\n\n~~~\n$ stack install attomail && sudo cp
  ~/.local/bin/attomail /usr/local/bin\n$ cat << EOF | sudo tee -a /etc/attomail.conf\nmailDir
  = /path/to/my/home/dir/Maildir/new \nuserName = myuserid\nEOF\n$ mkdir -p /path/to/my/home/dir/Maildir/new\n~~~\n\n##
  prerequisites\n\n- Haskell \n- unlikely to work properly on anything but a Linux
  system\n\n## purpose\n\nActs as a minimal (local delivery only, many features un-implemented)
  mail\ndelivery agent, or MDA, delivering mail to a local `maildir` format spool.\nHandy
  when you don't want to install an MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) or\nfuller-featured
  MDA - you just want a program which accepts \n`sendmail`-style delivery of messages
  from local programs, and dumps them\nsomewhere you can read them. \n\nIt is a port
  of [femtomail](<https://git.lekensteyn.nl/femtomail/>) to Haskell.\n(See this [StackExchange](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/82093/minimal-mta-that-delivers-mail-locally-for-cron)
  posting for femtomail's inception.)\n\n## configuration\n\nBy default, uses `/etc/attoparse.conf`
  as a configuration file.\n\n`/etc/attoparse.conf` needs to contain two lines, specifying
  the path to\na directory where messages should be delivered, and the userid of the\nperson
  who owns that directory.\n\ne.g.:\n\n~~~\nmailDir = /path/to/my/home/dir/Maildir/new
  \nuserName = myuserid\n~~~\n\nSo that other programs can find it, you probably want
  to install\n`attomail` somewhere on the system path - e.g. in `/usr/local/bin/attomail`.
  \n\n`attomail` needs to be either run by the user specified in the config file,
  or\n(more likely, if being called by, say, some cron job) root\n(or some other account\nwith
  permission to change uid, etc.).\nThis is because it makes use of the `setresgid`
  and `setresuid` C functions to change its uid etc to that user, and ability to do
  that is normally restricted.\n\nTo use some other location for the configuration
  file, define CONF_PATH as a\nmacro when running ghc.\n\ne.g.:\n\n~~~   \nstack build
  --ghc-options -optP-DCONF_PATH=/some/dir/my.conf \n~~~\n\nor\n\n~~~\ncabal build
  --ghc-option=-optP-DCONF_PATH=/some/dir/tmp.conf  \n~~~\n\nNo claims that this program
  is at all secure, use at your own risk.\n\n## command-line arguments\n\nUsage: \n\n*
  \  `attomail [-f ADDRESS] [-F NAME] [-b MODE] [-i] [-o ARG] [-O ARG] [-B ARG]\n
  \   [-q ARG] [-v] RECIPIENTS...`\n\nArguments that are actually processed:\n\n      -bm
  \        Read input from stdin, deliver mail in the usual way (default).\n      -Ffullname
  \ Set the full name of the sender.\n      -fname      Sets the name of the `from'
  person (i.e., the sender of the mail put on the enevelope)\n\nVarious ignored options,
  included only for compatibility with `sendmail`: `-i`, `-o`, `-O`, `-B`, `-q`, `-v`.\n\n##
  testing \n\n-   If you have a `mail` program installed, just use that for testing
  the\n    installation. Messages to any address at all, local or remote, should go\n
  \   to the mail spool specified.\n\n-   Alternatively:\n\n    ~~~\n    $ cat | sendmail
  a@b.com << EOF \n    To: someone@somewhere\n    Subject: mysubject\n    \n    some
  body\n    EOF\n    ~~~\n\n    *`<ctrl-d>`*\n\n## portability\n\nProbably won't work
  on anything but Linux systems.\n\n## API\n\nNone, yet, there's only an executable,
  not a library. But (*sssh*) take a peek\n[here](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/attomail-0.1.0.2/docs)
  if you like, there should be some minimal documentation of the internal modules.\n\n"
