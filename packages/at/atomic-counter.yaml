  # 0.1.2.3

  - Remove internal ‘test-utils’ library which wasn’t supposed to be used by clients anyway but was confusing cabal dependency resolution

  # 0.1.2.2

  - Lower minimum supported GHC to 8.6 and base to 4.12
  - Improve generated documentation
  - Faster `stg_newCounterzh`

  # 0.1.2.1

  - Disable cmm on 32 bit x86 architecture

  # 0.1.2

  - Add compare and swap operation
  - Add flag to force non-CMM implementation (`no-cmm`), not that users should use it normally

  # 0.1.1

  - On non-javascript platforms the counter is implemented directly in
    CMM instead of using singleton primitive array. Likely to occupy
    less memory and perform faster (https://github.com/sergv/atomic-counter/pull/3).

  # Synopsis

  Mutable cells that hold an integer value and can be safely modified from
  multiple threads. Support only few operations: read, write, +, -, and
  bitwise and, or, xor and nand.

  Good use case is a shared counter that multiple threads increment.

  Operations translate to atomic CPU instructions which involve memory
  barrier. For limited set of operation this package provides in
  concurrent setting they tend to be faster than atomic modify operation
  on `IORef`s and other shared var types. Value inside the `Counter`
  type is unboxed which contributes to outperforming all other shared
  vars because they box the value they store. For integers boxing is
  especially bad.

  For single-threaded use case this package will likely not outperform
  vanilla `IORef`s or `STRef`s (it depends on whether GHC adds memory
  barrier for them or not, cf
  https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/22764, if it does end up
  adding the same memory barrier then both this package and `IORef`
  should be equal). All in all, operations this package provides will
  incur guaranteed memory barrier which will serve no purpose in
  single-threaded settings so for that use case this package is probably
  not the best. The intended use of this package is in the concurrent
  setting where it does seem like a clear winner (please see benchmarks
  below).

  Still even is single-threaded scenario the `Counter` can serve as an
  efficient mutable integer cell that does not box the integer.

  # Benchmark

  ### Summary

  Depending on number of threads `Counter` from this package can be
  up to 10 times faster than next best `TVar` from the `stm` package.

  ### Details

  The benchmark is to spawn N threads each of which will increment the
  same counter by 1 for a number of iterations.

  Test setup: Intel i5-9600K CPU @ 3.70GHz, 6 cores, no hyperthreading, GHC 9.6.1.

  NB `IORef inconsistent` is the benchmark that just reads and writes
  `IORef` with the fastest functions the `IORef` supports. It gives
  wrong results when multiple threads access `IORef` this way since
  these reads and writes are not synchronized. It’s included only for
  speed comparison purposes. All others do proper synchronization of
  increments between the threads. Current package is shown as `Counter`.

  # Memory overhead

  In pure Haskell (i.e. with `no-cmm` flag enabled) each unlifted value of
  type `Counter` is a singleton mutable array from GHC primitives under
  the hood. Thus it occupies at least `platform integer size` + `array
  size` + `header` bytes which should typically be at least 3 machine
  words. Lifted values may occupy more depending on optimizations.

  By default CMM will be enabled which should save one word of overhead
  because there would be no array any more hence no need to store
  trivial size.
