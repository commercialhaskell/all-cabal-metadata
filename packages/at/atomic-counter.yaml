  # Synopsis

  Mutable cells that hold an integer value and can be safely modified from
  multiple threads. Support only few operations: read, write, +, -, and
  bitwise and, or, xor and nand.

  Good use case is a shared counter that multiple threads increment.

  Operations translate to atomic CPU instructions which make these cells
  way faster that even vanilla `IORef`. Value inside the cell is unboxed
  which contributes to outperforming all other shared vars because they
  box the value they store. For integers boxing is especially bad.

  # Benchmark

  ### Summary

  Depending on number of threads `Counter` from this package can be
  up to 10 times faster than next best `TVar` from the `stm` package.

  ### Details

  The benchmark is to spawn N threads each of which will increment the
  same counter by 1 for a number of iterations.

  Test setup: Intel i5-9600K CPU @ 3.70GHz, 6 cores, no hyperthreading, GHC 9.4.4.

  NB `IORef inconsistent` is the benchmark that just reads and writes
  `IORef` with the fastest functions the `IORef` supports. It gives
  wrong results when multiple threads access `IORef` this way since
  these reads and writes are not synchronized. It’s included only for
  speed comparison purposes. All others do proper synchronization of
  increments between the threads. Current package is shown as `Counter`.

  # Memory overhead

  Each unlifted value of type `Counter` is a singleton mutable array
  from GHC primitives under the hood. Thus it occupies at least
  `platform integer size` + `array size` + `header` bytes which should
  typically be at least 3 machine words. Lifted values may occupy more
  depending on optimizations.
