  @base@ provides

  @
  atomicModifyIORef :: IORef a -> (a -> (a, b)) -> IO b
  atomicModifyIORef2 :: IORef a -> (a -> (a, b)) -> IO (a, (a, b))
  @

  to modify the value in an @IORef@ and return a result (and, in the
  case of @atomicModifyIORef2@, also return the old value).

  In "Data.IORef.AtomicModify", we generalize this from pairs to arbitrary
  types for which the user can provide a function to extract the new
  value to store in the @IORef@.

  In "Data.IORef.AtomicModify.Generic", we offer a faster but more restricted
  version taking advantage of the fact that the primop used to implement
  @atomicModifyIORef2@ actually works for /somewhat/ more general record types
  than @atomicModifyIORef2@ accepts.
