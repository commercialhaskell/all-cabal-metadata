description: ! "arbtt, the Automatic Rule-Based Time Tracker\n============================================\n\n©
  2009 Joachim Breitner <mail@joachim-breitner.de>\n\nThe Automatic Rule-Based Time
  Tracker is a desktop daemon that runs in the\nbackground and, every minute, records
  what windows are open on your\ndesktop, what their titles are, which one is active.
  The accompanied\nstatistics program lets you derive information from this log file,
  i.e.\nwhat how much of your time have you been spending with e-Mail, or what\nprojects
  are your largest time wasters. The mapping from the raw window\ntitles to sensible
  „tags“ is done by a configuration file with an powerful\nsyntax.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou
  can build and install this program as any other Cabalized program:\n\n    $ runhaskell
  Setup.hs configure\n    $ runhaskell Setup.hs build\n    $ runhaskell Setup.hs install\n\nYou
  also need to make sure that arbtt-capture is started with your X\nsession. If you
  use GNOME or KDE, you can copy the file\n`arbtt-capture.desktop` to `~/.config/autostart/`.
  You might need to put the\nfull path to arbtt-capture in the `Exec` line there,
  if you did not do a\nsystem wide installation.\n\nIf you want to record samples
  at a different rate than one per minute, you\nwill have to pass the `--sample-rate`
  parameter to arbtt-capture.\n\nDocumentation\n------------\n\nFull documentation
  is now provided in the user manual in the doc/\ndirectory. If you have the docbook
  xsl toolchain installed, you can\ngenerate the HTML documentation by entering \"make\"
  in that directory.\nOtherwise, you can use the\n[online version of the User’s Guide](http://darcs.nomeata.de/arbtt/doc/users_guide/)\nBeware
  that this will also reflect the latest development version.\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nYou
  are very welcome to help the developement of arbtt. You can find the\nlatest source
  at the darcs repository at\n  http://darcs.nomeata.de/arbtt\n\nGit mirrors are available
  at\n\n * http://git.nomeata.de/?p=darcs-mirror-arbtt.git\n * https://github.com/nomeata/darcs-mirror-arbtt\n
  * https://bitbucket.org/nomeata/arbtt\n\nUser and Developer discussion happens on
  the arbtt mailing list:\n  arbtt@lists.nomeata.de\nTo subscribe to the list, visit:\n
  \ http://lists.nomeata.de/mailman/listinfo/arbtt\n\nThe issue tracker is hosted
  on bitbucket:\n  https://bitbucket.org/nomeata/arbtt/issues\nWhy Bitbucket and not
  GitHub? Why not, and we need diversitiy even in the\ncloud! (Don’t worry, you can
  use your GitHub account there.)\n\nSome of my plans or ideas include:\n\n * A graphical
  viewer that allows you to expore the tags in an appealing,\n   interactive way.
  Possibly based on the Charts haskell library.\n * Looking forward and backwards
  in time when writing rules. (Information\n   is already passed to the categorizing
  function, but not exposed to the\n   syntax).\n * `$total_idle` time, which is the
  maximum idle time until it is reset. This\n   would allow the user to catch the
  idle times more exactly.\n * Rules based on time of day, to create tags for worktime,
  weekend, late\n   at night. (Partially done)\n * Storing the current timezone in
  the tags, for the prevoius entry to be\n   more to be more useful.\n * Storing the
  hostname, in case a user has several. \n * Statistics based on time, to visualize
  trends.\n * Possibly more data sources?\n\nAny help cleaning, documenting or testing
  the current code is appreciated\nas well.\n\nCreating the Windows Installer\n------------------------------\n\nThe
  file `setup.iss` contains an installer script for Inno Setup and can be used\nto
  create the windows installer for arbtt. It can be used under wine. To build\narbtt
  under Windows, you need to install the Haskell Platform. Because the\nHaskell Platform
  ships an older version of the w32api package from mingw, you\nalso need to download
  `w32api-3.14-mingw32-dev.tar.gz` and copy at least the files\n`include/psapi.h`
  and `lib/libpsapi.a` over the files installed by the Haskell\nPlatform. For the
  `pcre-light` package, you need to install the `pcre` library.\nUnless you run a
  German version of Windows, you’ll need to adjust the path to\nthe `pcre3.dll` file
  in `setup.iss`. Install `Inno Setup`. Create the documentation\n(`make -C doc`)
  and configure arbtt with the `--with-ISCC-flag`:\n\n    $ wine runhaskell Setup.hs
  configure --with-ISCC='C:\\Programme\\Inno Setup 5\\ISCC.exe'\n\nagain adjusting
  the path if you do not have a German version of Windows. This\nwill put the version
  name into `setup.iss` and create the output file as\n`dist/arbtt-setup-<version>.exe.`\n\nDownload
