  ## Description
  This is a parser for ESRI/ArcInfo (ArcGrid) files. These are raster GIS files
  widely used by many geographics-related software to represent elevations or
  terrain features.

  Only ASCII GRID (.asc) files are supported at the moment.

  In `app/valley.asc` there is a test elevation model of a small valley area. It
  is parsed and printed by the `arcgrid-exe` if you do `stack exec arcgrid-exe`.

  ## Usage
  The library exports the `ArcGrid` datatype and its accessors:

  ``` haskell
  data ArcGrid = ArcGrid
                 { ncols :: Int
                 , nrows :: Int
                 , xllcorner :: Maybe Float
                 , yllcorner :: Maybe Float
                 , xllcenter :: Maybe Float
                 , yllcenter :: Maybe Float
                 , cellsize :: Float
                 , nodata_value :: Maybe Int
                 , vat :: [Int]
                 }
  ```

  The main interface for reading of grid files is `arcGridFromFile`, but the
  bytestring parser (to be used with Parsec) is also exported.

  ``` haskell
  arcGridFromFile :: String -> IO ArcGrid

  asciiGridParser :: Parser ArcGrid
  ```

  ## TODO:
  - unparsing
  - optimizations
  - support of proprietary binary formats?
