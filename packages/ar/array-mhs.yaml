  This is a copy of the array package adapted for MicroHs.

  In addition to providing the "Data.Array" module
  <http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/haskellch14.html as specified in the Haskell 2010 Language Report>,
  this package also defines the classes 'IArray' of
  immutable arrays and 'MArray' of arrays mutable within appropriate
  monads, as well as some instances of these classes.
