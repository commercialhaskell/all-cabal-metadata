description: |-
  A library providing tools and various schemes for encoding arbitrary datatypes
  as natural numbers.  The underlying theory is that of isomorphisms with the natural
  numbers (known as Godel numbering).  The library provides functionality for defining
  multiple such encodings for a given datatype, as well as a collection of stock
  encodings and combinators which can be used to build more complex encodings.

  This has various uses, among them binary serialization/deserialization and
  enumeration testing.
