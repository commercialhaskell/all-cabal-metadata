description: 'Boxed arrays cannot be allocated without initialization, because in
  that case the garbage collector would try to follow wild pointers. This is a source
  of inefficiency; quite a few operations must allocate a new array, initialize it,
  then overwrite the initial elements with the actually relevant data. This package
  provides low-level primitives for doing such operations without superfluous copying. '
