description: "# Simple viewer of ArcGrid geospatial data written in Haskell\n\n##
  Synopsis\nA simple viewer for ESRI/ArcInfo (ArcGrid) files. A user can pan, zoom
  and\nrotate the rendered dataset with keyboard and mouse (see _Controls_).\n\n\n![alt
  text](https://github.com/nbrk/arcgrid-viewer/blob/master/doc/scr_alps3.png \"Screenshot\")\n\n\nThe
  program uses shades of red (by default) normalized by minimum and maximum\nvalue
  in the VAT of the curent dataset. Black colour represents lower value than\nthe
  red one.\n\n## Installation\nThe program depends on `gloss` and `arcgrid` libraries.
  The easiest way is to\ninstall utulity `stack` and build the software from the source
  code.\n\nCurrently, as this:\n\n``` sh\n$ git clone https://github.com/nbrk/arcgrid.git\n$
  git clone https://github.com/nbrk/arcgrid-viewer.git\n$ cd arcgrid-viewer\n$ stack
  install\n# Usually stack will install the program binary in ~/.local/bin .\n# You
  can add it to PATH of you want.\n$ ~/.local/bin/arcgrid-viewer ../arcgrid/sample/alps_huge.asc\n```\n\n##
  Usage\nThe program supports rendering the dataset in few color schemes (red, black
  and\nwhite, a spectre) in both vector and raster modes. \n\n```\nUsage: arcgrid-viewer
  [OPTION...] <file>\n  -c MODE  --color=MODE  color scheme: red|bw|fancy\n  -r MODE
  \ --mode=MODE   rendering mode: vector|raster\n```\n\nThe defaults are to render
  **in raster** with **red gradient**.\nPlease keep in mind that big datasets take
  time and resources to parse and render!\n\nThere is some sample `.asc` elevation
  data from the Alps. It resides in `arcgrid`\nlibrary and is [located](https://github.com/nbrk/arcgrid/tree/master/sample)
  in `arcgrid/sample`.\n\n## Controls\nThe program uses `gloss` library for rendering
  and display. Therefore, the\ncontrols are:\n\n```\n* Quit\n  - esc-key\n\n* Move
  Viewport\n  - arrow keys\n  - left-click drag\n\n* Zoom Viewport\n  - page up/down-keys\n
  \ - control-left-click drag\n  - right-click drag\n  - mouse wheel\n\n* Rotate Viewport\n
  \ - home/end-keys\n  - alt-left-click drag\n\n* Reset Viewport\n  r-key\n```\n\n##
  TODO\n- Optimization. The viewer is too damn slow!\n- Maybe restrict display only
  to a selected rectangle.\n"
