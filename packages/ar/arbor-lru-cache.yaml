  # arbor-lru-cache

  A thread-safe LRU cache library.

  ## Example

  To use the cache:

  ```haskell
  main :: IO
  main = do
    -- Provide a configuration that includes how many simultaneous in
    -- flight requests are allowed and now many entries the cache can store
    let config = A.CacheConfig
          { A.maxRequestsInFlight = 1
          , A.maxOccupancy        = 1
          }

    -- Create a cache providing the config and functions that handle retrieval
    -- and eviction.
    cache <- A.makeCache config retrieve evict

    -- Perform your lookups
    _ <- A.lookup 1 cache
    _ <- A.lookup 2 cache
    _ <- A.lookup 3 cache

    return ()

  -- Implement value retrieval function.  If the same key is looked up multiple
  -- times, the cache guarantees that the retrieve function is called only once
  -- for that key up until it is evicted.
  retrieve :: Int -> IO String
  retrieve mk = ...

  -- Perform any cleanup that should occur when an entry is evicted
  -- Please be aware that if your code is concurrent, the eviction function may
  -- be called whilst the you code is concurrently using a value it has looked up.
  -- Your code is wholly responsible for ensuring this case still works.
  evict :: Int -> String -> IO ()
  evict mk mv = ...
  ```
