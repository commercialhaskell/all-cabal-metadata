description: ! "SYNOPSIS\n          arx (-h | -[?] | --help)\n          arx (-v |
  --version)\n          arx shdat (-b <size>)? (-o <output file>)? < input\n          arx
  shdat (-b <size>)? (-o <output file>)? <input file>+\n          arx tmpx <option,archive>*
  (//+ <command> (//+ <option,archive>*)?)?\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       A  UNIX  executable
  is a simple thing -- a file the kernel can execute,\n       one way or another,
  via an interpreter  or  directly  as  object  code.\n       Every  executable induces
  a family of executions -- instances of execu-\n       tion with different command
  line arguments, with different files in the\n       working directory and with different
  environment variables present.\n\n       The  arx  tool captures the parameters
  of an execution and encodes them\n       as an executable, making for easy, consistent
  transfer  and  repetition\n       of  a  particular  run.  The generated executable
  ensures that each run\n       occurs in a  freshly  allocated  temporary  directory,
  \ with  only  the\n       desired  files  in  scope;  it uses traps to ensure the
  cleanup of this\n       directory; and its format is a simple POSIX shell  script,
  \ relying  on\n       just a few shell tools.\n\nDEPENDENCIES\n       The  arx  tool
  relies on the presence of sed, tr, date, head, tar, hex-\n       dump and sh. When
  unpacking tar archives, it  may  use  the  -j  or  -z\n       (bzip2 and gzip, respectively)
  options of tar. Scripts have been tested\n       with dash and the GNU tools as
  well as the sh implementation and  user-\n       land tools that are part of busybox.\n\nAPPLICATION\n
  \      The  tmpx  subcommand  of  arx offers a variety of options for bundling\n
  \      code and a task to run. The shdat subcommand  exposes  the  lower-level\n
  \      functionality  of  encoding  binary data in a shell script that outputs\n
  \      that binary data, using HERE documents and some odd  replacement  rules\n
  \      for nulls.\n\n       Scripts generated by tmpx and shdat may be fed to sh
  over STDIN to exe-\n       cute them. This can be helpful when using ssh and sudo
  \ to  set  up  an\n       execution context; for example:\n\n          arx tmpx
  ... | ssh user@host.com sudo sh\n\n       Scripts  generated  by  tmpx will pass
  their arguments to the contained\n       script or command. To pass arguments when
  piping to sh, use -s:\n\n          arx tmpx ... | ssh user@host.com sudo sh -s a
  b c\n\n       Some arguments to the  generated  script  will  be  treated  specially,\n
  \      namely,  --extract,  --no-rm  and  --no-run.  Please see the section on\n
  \      Passing Arguments, below, for more information about these options.\n\nARX
  COMMANDLINE PROCESSING\n       For all subcommands, when options overlap in their
  effect -- for  exam-\n       ple,  setting  the  output with -o -- the rightmost
  option takes prece-\n       dence.  Whenever -h, -? or --help is present on the
  command line,  help\n       is displayed and the program exits.\n\n       When  paths
  \ are  specified on an arx command line, they must be quali-\n       fied, starting
  with /, ./ or ../. This simplifies the command line syn-\n       tax, overall, without
  introducing troublesome ambiguities.\n\nTMPX\n       The tmpx subcommand bundles
  together archives, environment settings and\n       an executable or shell command
  in to a  Bourne-compatible  script  that\n       runs  the  command or executable
  in a temporary directory, after having\n       unpacked the archives and set the
  environment.\n\n       Any number of file path arguments may be specified; they
  will be inter-\n       preted  as  tar  archives  to include in bundled script.
  If - is given,\n       then STDIN will be included as an archive stream. If no  arguments
  \ are\n       given,  it is assumed that no archives are desired and only the command\n
  \      and environment are bundled.\n\n       The temporary directory created by
  the script  is  different  for  each\n       invocation,  with a name of the form
  /tmp/tmpx-<timestamp>-<randomhex>.\n       The timestamp format is %Y.%m.%dT%H.%M.%SZ,
  in UTC.  One  happy  conse-\n       quence  of  this  is that earlier jobs sort
  ASCIIbetically before later\n       jobs. After execution, the temporary  directory
  \ is  removed  (or  not,\n       depending on the -rm[10!_] family of options).\n\n
  \         -rm0, -rm1, -rm_, -rm!\n                 By  default,  the  temporary
  \ directory created by the script\n                 will be deleted no matter the
  exit status status of the task.\n                 These options cause a script to
  be generated that deletes the\n                 temporary directory only on success,
  only on failure,  always\n                 (the default) or never.\n\n          --shared\n
  \                Causes  the temporary directory to be identified by a hash of\n
  \                the ARX archive, instead of by date and time. Different  runs\n
  \                of  the same archive will share the same directory. Note that\n
  \                this implies shared state and every disadvantage thereof.\n\n          -b
  <size>\n                 Please see the documentation for  this  option,  shared
  \ with\n                 shdat, below.\n\n          -o <path>\n                 By
  \ default, the generated script is sent to STDOUT. With -o,\n                 output
  is redirected to the given path.\n\n          -e <path>\n                 Causes
  the file specified to be packaged as the  task  to  be\n                 run.  A
  \ binary  executable, a Ruby script or a longish shell\n                 script
  all fit here.\n\n       In addition to these options, arguments of the form VAR=VALUE
  are  rec-\n       ognized  as  environment  mappings and stored away in the script,
  to be\n       sourced on execution.\n\n       Without -e, the tmpx subcommand tries
  to find the task to be run  as  a\n       sequence  of  arguments  delimited  by
  \ a run of slashes. The following\n       forms are all recognized:\n\n          arx
  tmpx  ...some args... // ...command...\n          arx tmpx  ...some args... // ...command...
  // ...more args...\n          arx tmpx // ...command... // ...some args...\n\n       The
  slash runs must have the same number of slashes  and  must  be  the\n       longest
  \ continuous  runs  of  slashes on the command line. The command\n       will be
  included as-is in a Bourne shell script.\n\nSHDAT\n       The shdat subcommand translates
  binary data in to a shell script  which\n       outputs  the binary data. The data
  is encoded in HERE documents in such\n       a way that data without NULs is not
  changed and that data with NULs  is\n       minimally  expanded:  about  1% for
  randomish data like compressed tar-\n       balls and about 10% in pathological
  cases.\n\n       The shdat subcommand can be given any number of paths,  which  will
  \ be\n       concatenated in the order given. If no path is given, or if - is given,\n
  \      then STDIN will be read.\n\n          -b <size>\n                 The size
  of data chunks to place in each HERE  document.  The\n                 argument
  \ is  a positive integer followed by suffixes like B,\n                 K, KiB,
  M and MiB, in the manner of dd, head and  many  other\n                 tools.  The
  default is 4MiB.  This is unlikely to make a dif-\n                 ference for
  you unless the generated script is intended to be\n                 run on a memory-constrained
  system.\n\n          -o <path>\n                 By  default, the generated script
  is sent to STDOUT. With -o,\n                 output is redirected to the given
  path.\n\nEXAMPLES\n          # Installer script that preserves failed builds.\n
  \         git archive HEAD | bzip2 | arx tmpx -rm0 - // make install > go.sh\n          #
  Now install as root; but don't log in as root.\n          cat ./go.sh | ssh joey@hostname
  sudo /bin/sh\n\n          # Variation of the above.\n          git archive HEAD
  | bzip2 | arx tmpx -rm0 - -e ./build-script.py > go.sh\n\n          # Bundle an
  instance of an application with DB credentials and run it.\n          arx tmpx -rm!
  ./app.tbz ./stage-info.tgz // rake start | ssh ...\n\n          # Get dump of linking
  info for build that works here but not there.\n          arx tmpx ./server-build.tgz
  LD_DEBUG=files // ./bin/start | ssh ...\n\n          # Test out Cabal source distribution
  of this package:\n          arx tmpx // 'cd arx-* && cabal configure && cabal build'
  // \\\n                   -rm0 ./dist/arx-0.0.0.tar.gz | sh\n\nPASSING ARGUMENTS
  TO GENERATED SCRIPTS\n       The scripts generated by tmpx treat some arguments
  as special, internal\n       options,  to allow for inspecting them should there
  be a need to deter-\n       mine their contents.\n\n          --extract\n                 Unpack
  the data in the present directory and do nothing else.\n\n          --no-rm\n                 Run
  the script as normal but do not delete the generated tem-\n                 porary
  directory.\n\n          --no-run\n                 Unpack into a temporary directory
  as normal but  do  not  run\n                 the user's command.\n\n       To  prevent
  arguments from being specially treated, use // in the argu-\n       ment list:\n\n
  \         a-tmpx-script.sh --no-rm // a b c --extract\n\n       In the above example,
  --extract will be passed to the inner command, in\n       the same way as a, b,
  c. The following example causes ab, c and --no-rm\n       to be printed one after
  another, each on their own line.\n\n          arx tmpx // printf \"'%s\\n'\" '\"$@\"'
  | sh -s // ab c --no-rm\n\nNOTES\n       The timestamp is not the common ISO  8601
  \ format,  %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ,\n       because  of software and build processes
  that attach special meaning to\n       colons in pathnames.\n\nBUGS\n       The
  command line parser offers no hints or help of any kind;  it  fails\n       with
  \ the simple message \"argument error\". The two most common mistakes\n       I
  make are:\n\n       o Not qualifying paths with /, ./ or ../.\n\n       o Not specifying
  a subcommand (tmpx or shdat).\n\n"
