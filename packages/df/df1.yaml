  # Version 0.4.3

  * Added instances for `text`'s `Builder`.

  * Don't escape `=` in `Value`.


  # Version 0.4.2

  * Remove a lot of inlining to make compilation faster.


  # Version 0.4.1

  * Add `ToPath`, `path`.

  * Add `ToValue` instances for `base`'s `Char`, `Fixed`; for `time`'s
    `SystemTime`, `UTCTime`, `CalendarDiffDays`, `CalendarDiffTime`, `Day`,
    `TimeZone`, `TimeOfDay`, `LocalTime`, `ZonedTime`, `NominalDiffTime`,
    `DiffTime`, `DayOfWeek`.

  * Add `ToSegment` instances for `base`'s `Char`.

  * Add `ToKey` instances for `base`'s `Char`.

  * Add `Read` instance for `Level`.


  # Version 0.4

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE: Change functions names `Df1.render` to
    `Df1.Render.log`, `Df1.renderColor` to `Df1.Render.logColorANSI`, and
    `Df1.parse` to `Df1.Parse.log`.

  * Exported `key`, `message`, `iso8601`, `segment` and `value` from module
    `Df1.Render`.


  # Version 0.3.2

  * Added `ToValue` instances for common types like `Int`, `Bool`, etc.

  * Changed colours in `Log` rendering.


  # Version 0.3.1

  * Added missing language pragma.


  # Version 0.3

  * The `segment`, `key`, `value` and `message` functions are now methods of the
    new `ToSegment`, `ToKey`, `ToValue` and `ToMessage` classes.  Identity
    instances, as well as instances for `String`, lazy `Text` and strict `Text`,
    have been introduced for these classes.


  # Version 0.2

  * BREAKING CHANGE: `Segment`, `Key`, `Value` and `Message` don't strip
    surrounding whitespace anymore. When rendering `Segment`, `Key` and `Value`,
    the whitespace will be percent-encoded. When rendering `Message`, the
    whitespace will be kept as is.

  * BREAKING CHANGE: `Segment` and `Key` now wrap lazy `Text`, rather than strict
    `Text`. This is to align their APIs with `Value` and `Message`, which already
    wrapped lazy `Text` so as to prevent logged `Value`s and `Message`s from
    to use much memory. It's unlikely that `Segment`s and `Key`s are affected by
    this, since in practice they are almost always created statically. So, this
    change is mostly to make the API less surprising to users: Lazy `Text` is used
    throughout.

  * Added draft BNF specification.


  # Version 0.1.2

  * Fixed escaping of control characters in `Message`.

  * Percent-escape less punctuation characters when rendering `Key`,
    `Segment` and `Value`.

    TODO: write spec.


  # Version 0.1.1

  * Fixed compilation.


  # Version 0.1

  * Consider this a preview release: The API is likely to stay stable, but
    extensive testing, formalization and tooling is due.
