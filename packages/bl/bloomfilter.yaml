  # A fast, space efficient Bloom filter implementation

  Copyright 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 Bryan O'Sullivan <bos@serpentine.com>.

  This package provides both mutable and immutable Bloom filter data
  types, along with a family of hash function and an easy-to-use
  interface.

  To build:

      cabal install bloomfilter

  For examples of usage, see the Haddock documentation and the files in
  the examples directory.
