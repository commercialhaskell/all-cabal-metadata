  0.11.1.0
  ===================
  * @bitemyapp
    - Add http-client-0.5.0 support

  0.11.0.0
  ===================

  Thanks to the following people, Bloodhound 0.10.0.0 is being released! This one gets a bit messy due to the Aeson 0.11 changeover, but this should be good to go now. Note that Aeson 0.11 returned to Aeson 0.9's behavior and semantics.

  * @MichaelXavier
    - #112 List indices support
    - #94 Implement index optimization
    - #91 Make `respIsTwoHunna` more semantic
      - More detail: This is actually the cause of a bug in real code. If you happen to be
        using parseEsResponse (which uses respIsTwoHunna) to parse the result of
        certain operations such as creating an index, those operations return a
        201 and unjustly are deemed to be a failure.
    - Cleaned up errant Haskell tokens in README
    - #84 Added request auth hooks

  * @dzhus / @MailOnline
    - #85 Add updateDocument

  * @ReadmeCritic
    - #108 Update README URLs based on HTTP redirects

    - Removed unused server versions from the tests
    - Updated readme to reflect actual ES versions supported and tested
    - Added support for parsing results of Missing Aggregations
    - #104 Export BucketValue
    - #102 Add local testing instructions to the README
    - #89 Support Bool and Numeric keys in TermsResults
    - Added Missing Aggregation support
    - #98 Improve EsProtocolException documentation for human error
    - Updated README to warn about 2.0 compatibility
    - Fix docs specifying an incorrect terminating condition

  * @bitemyapp
    - Merge monkey, puzzled over spurious local doctest failures

  0.10.0.0
  ===================

  Thanks to the following people, Bloodhound 0.10.0.0 is being released! This one gets a bit messy due to the Aeson 0.10 upgrade, so you may want to wait for the dust to settle. YMMV.

  * @MichaelXavier
    - #77: Add test for error parsing
    - #76/#78: Support for updating (modifying) index settings
    - #79/#80: Index aliases
    - #81: Low-level scroll API support
    - #82: Date range aggregation

  * @bitemyapp
    - Fucked around with dependencies and broke things in order to upgrade to Aeson 0.10
    - Please forgive me.

  0.9.0.0
  ===================

  Thanks to the following people, Bloodhound 0.9.0.0 is being released!

  * Highlighting, thanks to @latkins! See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-highlighting.html and http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/highlighting-intro.html for more

  * Added 1.4.0 support and CI integration

  * Can generate individual bulk operations, https://github.com/bitemyapp/bloodhound/issues/17, bulk requests should be more efficient now too - Vector instead of List.

  ![Bloodhound (dog)](./bloodhound.jpg)

  Elasticsearch client and query DSL for Haskell
  ==============================================

  Why?
  ----

  Search doesn't have to be hard. Let the dog do it.

  Endorsements
  ------------

  "Bloodhound makes Elasticsearch almost tolerable!" - Almost-gruntled user

  "ES is a nightmare but Bloodhound at least makes it tolerable." - Same user, later opinion.

  Version compatibility
  ---------------------

  As of version 0.13.0.0, Bloodhound has 2 separate module trees for
  Elasticsearch versions 1 and 5. Import the module that is appropriate
  for your use case. If you would like to add support for another major
  version, open a ticket expressing your intend and follow the pattern
  used for other versions. We weighed the idea of sharing code between
  versions but it just got too messy, especially considering the
  instability of the Elasticsearch API. We switched to a model which
  would allow the persons responsible for a particular protocol version
  to maintain that version while avoiding conflict with other versions.

  See our [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/bitemyapp/bloodhound) for a
  listing of Elasticsearch version we test against.


  Stability
  ---------

  Bloodhound is stable for production use. I will strive to avoid breaking API compatibility from here on forward, but dramatic features like a type-safe, fully integrated mapping API may require breaking things in the future.

  Testing
  ---------

  The TravisCI tests are run using [Stack](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README.html). You should use Stack instead of `cabal` to build and test Bloodhound to avoid compatibility problems. You will also need to have an Elasticsearch instance running at `localhost:9200` in order to execute some of the tests. See the "Version compatibility" section above for a list of Elasticsearch versions that are officially validated against in TravisCI.

  Steps to run the tests locally:
    1. Dig through the [past releases] (https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases) section of the Elasticsearch download page and install the desired Elasticsearch versions.
    2. Install [Stack] (http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README.html#how-to-install)
    3. In your local Bloodhound directory, run `stack setup && stack build`
    4. Start the desired version of Elasticsearch at `localhost:9200`, which should be the default.
    5. Run `stack test` in your local Bloodhound directory.
    6. The unit tests will pass if you re-execute `stack test`. If you want to start with a clean slate, stop your Elasticsearch instance, delete the `data/` folder in the Elasticsearch installation, restart Elasticsearch, and re-run `stack test`.

  Possible future functionality
  =============================

  Span Queries
  ------------

  Beginning here: <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-span-first-query.html>

  Function Score Query
  --------------------

  <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-function-score-query.html>

  Node discovery and failover
  ---------------------------

  Might require TCP support.

  Support for TCP access to Elasticsearch
  ---------------------------------------

  Pretend to be a transport client?

  Bulk cluster-join merge
  -----------------------

  Might require making a lucene index on disk with the appropriate format.

  GeoShapeQuery
  -------------

  <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-geo-shape-query.html>

  GeoShapeFilter
  --------------

  <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-geo-shape-filter.html>

  Geohash cell filter
  -------------------

  <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-geohash-cell-filter.html>

  HasChild Filter
  ---------------

  <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-has-child-filter.html>

  HasParent Filter
  ----------------

  <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-has-parent-filter.html>

  Indices Filter
  --------------

  <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-indices-filter.html>

  Query Filter
  ------------

  <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-filter.html>

  Script based sorting
  --------------------

  <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-sort.html#_script_based_sorting>

  Collapsing redundantly nested and/or structures
  -----------------------------------------------

  The Seminearring instance, if deeply nested can possibly produce nested structure that is redundant. Depending on how this affects ES performance, reducing this structure might be valuable.

  Runtime checking for cycles in data structures
  ----------------------------------------------

  check for n \> 1 occurrences in DFS:
