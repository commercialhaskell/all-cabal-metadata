  # Welcome to blaze-textual

  blaze-textual is a fast Haskell library for rendering common Haskell
  datatypes in text form using the
  [blaze-builder](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/blaze-builder)
  library.

  # Important note for users of GHCi and Template Haskell

  To achieve excellent performance for rendering floating point numbers,
  this package can optionally use the
  [double-conversion](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/double-conversion)
  package.

  Unfortunately, due to bugs in GHC, some uses of GHCi and Template
  Haskell can crash if the double-conversion package is used.  As a
  result, this package's use of double-conversion is disabled by default.

  * [5289: Can't use ghci with a library linked against
    libstdc++](http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/5289) (fixed
    in GHC 7.2.1).

  * [5386: GHCi crashes with SIGFPE when using double-conversion
    package](http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/5386) (not yet
    fixed at the time of writing)

  If you enable use of double-conversion and are affected by these
  problems, you should expect the 5289 crash to look like this:

      Loading package double-conversion-0.2.0.0 ... can't load .so/.DLL for: stdc++

  The 5386 crash causes GHCi to die with a floating point exception
  (SIGFPE).

  To work around these bugs, this package includes an alternative,
  slower, floating point conversion that is written in pure Haskell.
  Although it is 10 times slower than the double-conversion package, it
  is the default because it does not crash.

  If you don't use GHCi or Template Haskell, and you want to force
  the use of double-conversion, you can reinstall this package by
  disabling the `native` flag with `cabal`:

      cabal install -f-native --reinstall

  Afterwards, you will also need to reinstall any downstream packages
  that depend on this one, e.g. the [aeson JSON
  library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson):

      cabal install aeson --reinstall
