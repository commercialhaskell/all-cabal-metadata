changelog: |
  * 0.4.2.2
    - Support GHC 9.2

  * 0.4.2.1
    - Bump cabal file to Cabal >= 1.10

  * 0.4.2.0
    - Make semigroup instances unconditional
    - Support bytestring-0.11
    - Support semigroups-0.19

  * 0.4.1.0
    - Gain compatibility with the Semigroup/Monoid proposal
    - Add Word8 HTML escaping builders
    - Speed up `fromHtmlEscapedText` and `fromHtmlEscapedLazyText`

  * 0.4.0.2
    - Fixed warnings on GHC 7.10,  courtesy of Mikhail Glushenkov.

  * 0.4.0.1
    - Tightened the version constraints on the bytestring package for GHC 7.8

  * 0.4.0.0
    - This is now a compatibility shim for the new bytestring builder.  Most
      of the old internal modules are gone.   See this blog post for more
      information:

      <http://blog.melding-monads.com/2015/02/12/announcing-blaze-builder-0-4/>

    - The 'Blaze.ByteString.Builder.Html.Utf8.fromHtmlEscaped*' functions now
      strip out any ASCII control characters present in their inputs.  See
      <https://github.com/lpsmith/blaze-builder/issues/1> for more
      information.

  * 0.3.3.0
    - exposed the 'Buffer' constructor to enable keeping around a pool of
      buffers.

  * 0.3.2.0
    - added 'writeToByteString' to construct a strict bytestring in a single
      step. We can actually view 'Write's as strict-bytestring builders.

  * 0.3.1.1
    - Changed imports of Foreign.Unsafe to make it GHC 7.8 compatible
    - -Wall clean on GHC 7.0 - 7.6

  * 0.3.1.0
    - Widened dependencies on text and bytestring

  * 0.3.0.1

    - Fix build warning in Blaze.ByteString.Builder.Word
      (contributed by Greg Weber)

  * 0.3.0.1

    - Remove comparison to the 'text' library encoding functions of
      'Blaze.Builder.Char.Utf8.fromText' and
      'Blaze.Builder.Char.Utf8.fromLazyText'. Bryan O'Sullivan reported that on
      his 64-bit system with GHC 7.0.3 the 'text' library is 5x faster than the
      'blaze-builder' library.

  * 0.3.0.0

    - Renamings in internal modules: WriteIO -> Poke and associated functions.

  * 0.2.1.4

    - Fixed bug: appending to 'chunkedTransferEncoding somebuilder' also encoded
      the appended builder, which is obviously wrong.

  * 0.2.1.3

    - Fixed bug: 'chunkedTransferTerminator' is now correctly set to "0\r\n\r\n".

  * 0.2.1.2

    - Add 'MonoPatBinds' language extension to all relevant files to solve the
      issues caused by GHC bug http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/4498

  * 0.2.1.1

    - Reexport 'Write' datatype and 'fromWriteList', 'fromWriteSingleton',
      'fromWrite' functions together with writes and builders for storables.
    - Add 'MonoPatBinds' language extension to (hopefully) solve the issues
      caused by GHC bug http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/4498

  * 0.2.1.0

    Incorporated several design changes:
      - Writable buffer range is now represented in a packed form. This improves
        speed slightly, as less currying is used.
      - Writes are abstracted such that their internal representation can be
        exchanged without breaking other library code.
      - Writes are represented in a form that allows for efficient monoid
        instances for branching code like UTF-8 encoding. For single character
        encoding this results currently in a slight slowdown due to GHC not
        recognizing the strictness of the returned value. This will be fixed in
        the future.
      - BuildSteps support returning a result in `Done`, which enables to
        implement a `Put` monad using CPS.
      - chunked list writes were removed, as they result in worse performance
        when writing non-trivial lists. (cf. benchmarks)
      - An internal buffering abstraction is introduced, which is used both
        by the adaption of the `binary` package, as well as by the
        `blaze-builder-enumeratee` package, to execute puts and builders.
        It will be used later also by the execution functions of the
        `blaze-builder` package.

    Implemented new functionality
      - `Blaze.ByteString.Builder.HTTP` provides a builder transformer for
         doing in-buffer chunked HTTP encoding of an arbitary other builder.
      - `Blaze.ByteString.Builder.Char8` provides functions to serialize the
         lower 8-bits of characters similiar to what `Data.ByteString.Char8`
         provides for bytestrings.

  * 0.2.0.3

    Loosen 'text' dependency to '>= 0.10 && < 0.12'

  * 0.2.0.2

    Fixed bug: use &#39; instead of &apos; for HTML escaping '

  * 0.2.0.1

    Added a missing benchmark file.

  * blaze-builder-0.2.0.0

    Heavily restructured 'blaze-builder' such that 'Blaze.ByteString.Builder' serves as
    a drop-in replacement of 'binary:Data.Binary.Builder' which it improves upon
    with respect to both speed as well as expressivity. See the documentation and
    the benchmarks for details on improvements and new functionality.

    Changed module structure:
      Blaze.ByteString.Builder.Core -> Blaze.ByteString.Builder
      Blaze.ByteString.Builder.Utf8 -> Blaze.ByteString.Builder.Char.Utf8
      Blaze.ByteString.Builder.Html -> Blaze.ByteString.Builder.Html.Utf8

    Changed function names:
      writeByte     -> writeWord8
      fromByte      -> fromWord8
      fromWriteList -> fromWrite1List

    Possibly performance sensitive implementation changes:
      - 'fromByteString' and 'fromLazyByteString' check now if a direct insertion
        of the bytestring(s) would be cheaper than copying it. See their
        documentation on how to recover the old behaviour.

    Deprecated functions:
      'empty'    : use 'mempty' instead
      'singleton': use 'fromWord8' instead
      'append'   : use 'mappend' instead


  * blaze-builder-0.1

    This is the first version of 'blaze-builder'. It is explicitely targeted at
    fast generation of UTF-8 encoded HTML documents in the 'blaze-html' and the
    'hamlet' HTML templating libraries.

  blaze-builder
  =============

  This library allows to efficiently serialize Haskell values to lazy bytestrings
  with a large average chunk size. The large average chunk size allows to make
  good use of cache prefetching in later processing steps (e.g. compression) and
  reduces the system call overhead when writing the resulting lazy bytestring to a
  file or sending it over the network.

  This library was inspired by the module `Data.Binary.Builder` provided by the
  `binary` package. It was originally developed with the specific needs of the
  `blaze-html` package in mind. Since then it has been restructured to serve as a
  drop-in replacement for `Data.Binary.Builder`, which it improves upon both in
  speed as well as expressivity.

  To see the improvements in speed, run the throughput benchmark, which measures
  serialization speeds for writing `Word8`, `Word16`, `Word32` and `Word64` in different
  endian formats and different chunk sizes, using the command
  ```
    make bench-throughput
  ```
  or run the list serialization comparison benchmark
  ```
    make bench-blaze-vs-binary
  ```
  Checkout the combinators in the module `Blaze.ByteString.Builder.Write` to see
  the improvements in expressivity. This module allows to incorporate efficient
  primitive buffer manipulations as parts of a builder. We use this facility
  in the `blaze-html` HTML templating library to allow for the efficient
  serialization of HTML escaped and UTF-8 encoded characters.
