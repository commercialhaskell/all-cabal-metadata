  ### 0.7.4 [2023.10.05]
  * Support building with `scotty-0.20`.

  ### 0.7.3
  * Allow building with GHC 9.0.

  ### 0.7.2
  * Render Unicode codepoints beyond `0xFFFF` properly.

  ### 0.7.1
  * Remove the `wiki-suite` test suite from `blank-canvas.cabal`, as it was never
    intended to work as a traditional test suite. The functionality of
    `wiki-suite` has moved to a subdirectory of the upstream `blank-canvas`
    repository.

  ## 0.7
  * Strengthen the `Monad` constraint on `readColourName` to `MonadFail`.

  #### 0.6.3
  * Use `base-compat-batteries`.

  ### 0.6.2
  Additions
   * Add `Semigroup` instance for `Canvas`

  ### 0.6.1
  * Fix building with `aeson-1.2.2.0`.

  ### 0.6
  API changes
   * The `(#)` function had its type generalized from `a -> (a -> Canvas b) -> Canvas b` to `a -> (a -> b) -> b`. This allows it to be used with font length units.
   * Added more type synonyms (`Interval`, `Degrees`, `Radians`, etc.) to more clearly indicate what functions expect constrained values.
   * `showbJS` (formerly `showJS`) and `jsStyle` now return a text `Builder` instead of a `String`. This change was introduced as part of a larger `blank-canvas` refactoring to increase performance. See the `Data.Text.Lazy.Builder` module from the `text` package for more details on how to use `Builder`s.

  API additions
   * A new ADT for `Font`s has been added in `Graphics.Blank.Font` that can be used in place of `Text`. For example, `"30pt Calibri"` is equivalent to `(defFont "Calibri") { fontSize = 30 # pt }`.
   * A generalized `font` function of type `CanvasFont canvasFont => canvasFont -> Canvas ()` was added to `Graphics.Blank.Font` that can accept a `Text` or `Font` argument. The `font` function in `Graphics.Blank` remains of type `Text -> Canvas ()`.
   * Added a `cursor` function to change the browser cursor. Also added the `Graphics.Blank.Cursor` module containing a generalized `cursor` function that uses a `Cursor` ADT instead of `Text`.
   * Added `Bounded`, `Enum`, `Eq`, `Ix`, `Ord`, and `Show` instances for more data types
   * Added support for more MIME types via the `mime-types` library

  Additions
   * Allowed building with `base-4.8.0.0`

  Other
   * Require `scotty` >= 0.10 and `kansas-comet` >= 0.4

  ## 0.5

  API changes
   * Using Double rather than Float
   * Generalized saveRestore to be polymorphic

  API additions
   * Added sync for forcing synchronization between the server and client
   * Added argument specific variants of drawImage and putImageData.
   * Added ADTs for RepeatDirection, Alignment, Baseline, LineEnds, Corner (previous used Text)
   * Use of the colour(sic) package (Text is still allowed)

  Bug fixes:
   * Fixed unicode escapes in strings

  Additions:
   * Allow Images to access client-side filesystem

  ### Background

  **blank-canvas** is a Haskell binding to the complete HTML5 Canvas
  API. blank-canvas allows Haskell users to write, in Haskell,
  interactive images onto their web browsers. blank-canvas gives the
  user a single full-window canvas, and provides many well-documented
  functions for rendering images.

  ### First Example

  ````Haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
  module Main where

  import Graphics.Blank                     -- import the blank canvas

  main = blankCanvas 3000 $ \ context -> do -- start blank canvas on port 3000
          send context $ do                 -- send commands to this specific context
                  moveTo(50,50)
                  lineTo(200,100)
                  lineWidth 10
                  strokeStyle "red"
                  stroke()                  -- this draws the ink into the canvas
  ````

  Running this program, and going to <http://localhost:3000/> gives
