  # Version 0.3

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The `hash` function now takes
    an optional `Key`.

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The `hasher` function was
    removed. Instead, use `init` without specifying a `Key`.

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The `hashKeyed` and
    `hasherKeyed` functions were removed. Instead, specify the `Key` when using
    `hash` and `init`.

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The `digest` functions is not
    exported anymore. The `Digest` constructor is exported instead.

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The `Context` datatype and the
    `context` function are not exported anymore. The `derive` function takes a
    polymorphic context instead.

  * Functions that previously returned a `Digest` now return a polymorphic
    `ByteArrayN`. This makes it easy for downstream libraries to reuse any BLAKE3
    output for other purposes without having to copy bytes over. The `Digest`
    datatype is still exported as a convenience.

  * Added `sse2` Cabal flag to enable SSE2 optimizations.

  * Bumped upstream BLAKE3 C sources to latest version as of February 4, 2023.


  # Version 0.2

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Drop the `BLAKE3.Raw` module
    in favor of `BLAKE.IO`. Re-export internals from there.

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Drop `HasherInternal` and
    related functions in favor of `Ptr Hasher`.

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Drop `allocRetHasher`,
    `allocRetKey`, `allocRetDigest`.

  * Added `Eq`, `Show`, `Storable`, `ByteArrayAccess` and `ByteArrayN` instances
    for `Hasher`, `Key` and `Digest`.

  * Added `ByteArrayAccess` instance for `Context`.

  * Added `finalizeSeek`, `modifyHasher`, `digest`.

  * More tests.

  * Documentation improvements.


  # Version 0.1.1

  * Enabled AVX-512, AVX2 and SSE-4.1 support.

    On x86_64 Linux, Darwin and Windows, assembly implementations are used.
    Elsewhere, C intrinsics are used.

    The `avx512`, `avx2` and `sse41` Cabal flags can be used to disable these
    optimizations.

  * Documentation fixes.


  # Version 0.1

  * Initial version.

  * Using upstream C code from
    [https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3](https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3)
    version `5651ce7ee0b0ad2f577beef7efcef87e2f39fbe2`.

  # Haskell BLAKE3

  Bindings to
  the [official fast BLAKE3 implementations in assembly and C](https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3),
  with support for AVX-512, AVX2 and SSE 4.1, SSE 2.

  # Development

  * Build with `nix-build -A ghc865` (or `ghc883`).

  * Enter into a development environment with `nix-shell -A ghc865` (or `ghc883`).
    From this environment, you can build with `cabal new-build blake3`, test with
    `cabal new-test blake3`, render documentation with `cabal new-haddock blake3`,
    etc.
