description: Blogination reads files written in markdown and outputs xhtml. Supports
  syntax highlighting. Philosophy is simplicity. Can be used as a library, in a web
  application for example. Intended use is a simple commandline program to run after
  changes are made. Ideally use darcs or git with it.
