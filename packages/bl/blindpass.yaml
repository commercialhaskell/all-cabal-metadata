  ## Purpose

  This is a simple program that allows you to enter a command that
  requires a password without leaving a record of that password in hour
  history file.

  Instead of running a command as:

  ```bash
  somecommand my-super-secret-password
  ```

  You can instead enter:

  ```bash
  somecommand `blindpass`
  ```

  You will then be prompted twice for a password (whithout echoing to
  the screen).  If the passwords match, the password will be passed to
  your command as though it had been entered from the command line.  If
  the passwords do not match, you will be prompted again.  No record of
  this password will be kept anywhere.
