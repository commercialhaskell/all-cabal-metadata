description: |-
  bluesky-tools provides tools that I've found useful while trying to integrate
  my applications with the Bluesky social network (https://bsky.social).
  Some or most of the tools are more correctly AT protocol tools, rather than
  specific to Bluesky, but I have not made that distinction in the docs.
