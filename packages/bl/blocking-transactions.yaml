description: |-
  A variable type (BVar), monad (BTM), and arrow
  (BTA), which provide fast, atomic, composable, blocking
  inter-thread communication.  Blocking transactions are
  strictly less expressive than software transactional
  memory, but may be more efficient under very high
  contention.
