description: |-
  Perform batches of disk I\/O operations. Performing batches of disk I\/O can
  lead to performance improvements over performing each disk I\/O operation
  individually. Performing batches of disk I\/O /concurrently/ can lead to an
  even bigger performance improvement depending on the implementation of batched
  I\/O.

  The batched I\/O functionality in the library is separated into an /abstract/
  /interface/ and /implementations/ of that abstract interface. The advantage of
  programming against an abstract interface is that code can be agnostic to the
  implementation of the interface, allowing implementations to be freely swapped
  out. The library provides multiple implementations of batched I\/O:
  platform-dependent implementations using the /real/ file system (with
  asynchronous I\/O), and a simulated implementation for testing purposes.

  See the "System.FS.BlockIO" module for an example of how to use the library.
