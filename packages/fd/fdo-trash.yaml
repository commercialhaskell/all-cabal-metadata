  The package creates utility called fdo-trash and a small library that provides
  much of the same functionality.

  Fdo trash has 3 utilities, fdo-rm, fdo-unrm and fdo-purge. These executable can
  be invoked by symlinking fdo-trash to properly named file (like busybox) or via
  fdo-trash with applet name (eg. fdo-trash rm [file]).

  Use man/genManPages to generate man pages for the utilities. (requires
  help2man).

  fdo-rm moves files to freedesktop trash, fdo-unrm moves them back and fdo-purge
  removes obsolete files from trash.
