  ## 1.0.0.0 -- 2020-12-20

description: |-
  This is a logging facility.  Yes, there are many, and this is the one
  with a beard, wearing flannel and boots, that gets the job done.  It's
  not the fanciest, it doesn't have a cargo-van full of features.  This
  logger is designed to be straightforward to use, provide a good set of
  standard features, and be useable across a broad set of code.

  * Logging itself is a monadic activity.  This activity is most often
  performed in a monad stack with a MonadIO context to allow
  writing to files.

  * The specific logging action implementations are managed separately
  from the actions of logging messages in the target code.  This
  allows logging to be configurable and the manner of logging to
  be specified at startup time without requiring changes in the
  code from which log messages are being generated.

  * The logging implementation code can use contravariant functors to
  adjust existing logging.

  * Main code will typically retrieve the logging actions from a Reader
  context in your monad stack.  That said, Log actions are not tied
  to an enclosing Monad.  There are helpers to support a Monad which
  can store Log actions, but Log actions can also be explicitly
  passed and used.

  * The prettyprinter package is used for formatting.
