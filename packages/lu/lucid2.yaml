  ## 0.0.20230706

  * Inline the `blaze-builder` modules in-use into the package, to drop
    dependency on
    `blaze-builder`. <https://github.com/chrisdone/lucid/issues/143>

  ## 0.0.20221012

  * Fix `commuteHtmlT` in favor of newly added `commuteHtmlT2`

  ## 0.0.20220526

  This release adds some extra functions for running different monad
  stacks, prompted by Joe Vargas.

  * Add `generalizeHtmlT`, `commuteHtmlT` and `hoistHtmlT`.
  * Deprecate the accidentally exported `relaxHtmlT = undefined`.

  ## 0.0.20220509

  * Use explicit imports for mtl, avoiding mtl-2.3 incompatibility.

  ## New in lucid2

  lucid2 is a new package published to Hackage and maintained under `lucid2/` in this repository alongside `lucid1`. Releases are made under the [Immutable Publishing Policy](https://chrisdone.com/posts/ipp/), and users had asked for many breaking changes, therefore we needed a completely new namespace to work under, hence, "lucid2". Many things have also been dropped in the process, to simplify the codebase.

  This upgrade is **entirely optional**.

  People using `lucid` **will not have to do anything**. They can continue using that package indefinitely, it will be maintained alongside `lucid2`, to keep it building with GHCs and things. You can even use both packages in the same codebase with `-XPackageImports`.

  Changed:

  * All `on*` attributes and `style_` do not escape their values anymore. Be
    careful. Though you were probably being careful with these anyway,
    as they are inherently dangerous for XXS.
  * The `Attribute` type has been replaced by `Attributes`, which is a `Monoid` instance. This makes it really easy to write code like `if X then class_ "foo" else mempty`.
  * The `class_` and `style_` attributes combine with a space and `;` between them when there are duplicates, e.g. `[class_ "x",class_ "y"]` produces `class="x y"`. These are special cases, the rest of the attributes do not have special combining behavior and will be simple concatenation.

  Renamed:

  * makeAttribute is renamed to makeAttributes.
  * Added makeAttributesRaw.

  Dropped:

  * Eq/Ord/Show instances for Attribute.
  * Drop the `Lucid.Bootstrap` module entirely.
  * Dropped the mmorph dependency (breaking changes often, not
    reliable), instead we provide a simple `hoist` function of the right
    type.
  * Drop MonadError.
  * Drop MonadWriter.
  * Drop hashable.
  * Drop XML elements.

  Dependencies:

  * We now only depend on blaze-builder, and the rest are libraries that
    come with GHC, which are held to a slightly higher standard of not
    breaking changes.

  ## Version

  This is version 2 of the lucid package, according to the
  [Immutable Publishing Policy](https://chrisdone.com/posts/ipp/).

  There never be any breaking changes made to this package.

  ## Introduction

  HTML terms in Lucid are written with a postfix ‘`_`’ to indicate data
  rather than code. Some examples:

  `p_`, `class_`, `table_`, `style_`

  See `Lucid.Html5` for a complete list of Html5 combinators.

  Plain text is written using the `OverloadedStrings` and
  `ExtendedDefaultRules` extensions, and is automatically escaped:

  ``` haskell
  λ> "123 < 456" :: Html ()
  ```

  ``` html
  123 &lt; 456
  ```

  Elements nest by function application:

  ``` haskell
  λ> table_ (tr_ (td_ (p_ "Hello, World!"))) :: Html ()
  ```

  ``` html
  <table><tr><td><p>Hello, World!</p></td></tr></table>
  ```

  Elements are juxtaposed via monoidal append:

  ``` haskell
  λ> p_ "hello" <> p_ "sup" :: Html ()
  ```

  ``` html
  <p>hello</p><p>sup</p>
  ```

  Or monadic sequencing:

  ``` haskell
  λ> div_ (do p_ "hello"; p_ "sup") :: Html ()
  ```

  ``` html
  <div><p>hello</p><p>sup</p></div>
  ```

  Attributes are set by providing an argument list:

  ``` haskell
  λ> p_ [class_ "brand"] "Lucid Inc" :: Html ()
  ```

  ``` html
  <p class="brand">Lucid Inc</p>
  ```

  Here is a fuller example of Lucid:

  ``` haskell
  table_ [rows_ "2"]
         (tr_ (do td_ [class_ "top",colspan_ "2",style_ "color:red"]
                      (p_ "Hello, attributes!")
                  td_ "yay!"))
  ```

  ``` html
  <table rows="2">
    <tr>
      <td style="color:red" colspan="2" class="top">
        <p>Hello, attributes!</p>
      </td>
      <td>yay!</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  ```

  ## Rendering

  For proper rendering you can easily run some HTML immediately with:

  ``` haskell
  λ> renderText (p_ "Hello!")
  ```

  ``` html
  "<p>Hello!</p>"
  ```

  Or to bytes:

  ``` haskell
  λ> renderBS (p_ [style_ "color:red"] "Hello!")
  ```

  ``` html
  "<p style=\"color:red\">Hello!</p>"
  ```

  For ease of use in GHCi, there is a `Show` instance, as
  demonstrated above.

  If the above rendering functions aren't suited for your purpose, you
  can run the monad directly via `execHtml` and use the more low-level
  blaze `Builder`, which has a plethora of output modes in
  Blaze.ByteString.Builder.

  See the documentation for the `Lucid` module for information about
  using it as a monad transformer.

  ## Good to know

  * Attributes are escaped, so you cannot write arbitrary JavaScript in attributes. Instead, do something like `onclick_ "foo()"`.
  * Attributes are rendered in the order that they are written in your Haskell code.

  ## Transforming

  You can use `lift` to call parent monads.

  ``` haskell
  λ> runReader (renderTextT (html_ (body_ (do name <- lift ask
                                              p_ [class_ "name"] (toHtml name)))))
               ("Chris" :: String)
  ```
  ``` html
  "<html><body><p class=\"name\">Chris</p></body></html>"
  ```
