  # Changelog

  `lua` uses [PVP Versioning][].

  ## lua-2.3.1

  Released 2023-03-17.

  -   New module *Lua.Debug*: the module provides bindings to a
      subset of functions of the Lua debug interface. Currently the
      module only binds `lua_getupvalue` and `lua_setupvalue`.

  ## lua-2.3.0

  Released 2023-03-13.

  -   New function `hslua_setwarnf`: The function allows to set a
      C function as a hook that is called on all complete warning
      messages. It is intended as a simple way to set a custom
      warning function.

  -   Export version and copyright info from Lua.Constants: the
      following patterns are made available, with content identical
      to that of the respective C functions: `LUA_VERSION`,
      `LUA_RELEASE`, and `LUA_COPYRIGHT`.

  -   Added a new flag `cross-compile`. When enabled, the code is
      setup in a way that allows cross-compilation of the package,
      but some of the string constants will be hard-coded and may
      not match the Lua version against which the library is
      compiled.

  -   `Type` is now an instance of `Read`.

  ## lua-2.2.1

  Released 2022-06-19.

  -   Make string-peeking independent of the current foreign
      encoding: always use char8 encoding to retrieve values of
      `LUA_PRELOAD_TABLE` and `LUA_LOADED_TABLE`.

  ## lua-2.2.0

  Released 2022-02-19.

  -   Update to Lua 5.4, include Lua 5.4.4 by default.

  -   Removed `hardcode-reg-keys` flag: this is no longer required
      for Lua 5.4.

  -   Support arbitrary number of uservalues: Lua 5.4 allows an
      arbitrary number of uservalues to be associated with userdata
      objects. The functions `lua_newuserdata`, `lua_getuservalue`,
      and `lua_setuservalue` are replaced with the new functions
      `lua_newuserdatauv`, `lua_getiuservalue`, and
      `lua_setiuservalue`, respectively.

      The function `hslua_newhsuserdata` is renamed to
      `hslua_newhsuserdatauv` and takes the number of associated
      uservalues as an additional argument.

  -   Support for the new warnings system: export binding to
      `lua_warning`.

  -   The function `lua_gc` now takes three data arguments of type
      CInt. This is a workaround for the fact that the C function
      has become variadic.

  -   The new patterns `LUA_GCGEN` and `LUA_GCINC` are usable with
      `lua_gc` to switch to generational and incremental garbage
      collection, respectively.

  ## lua-2.1.0

  Released 29-01-2022.

  -   The functions `lua_rawget` and `lua_rawgeti` now return the
      type of the value that was pushed to the stack.

  -   Added bindings to unsafe function `lua_arith`. A new type
      `ArithOPCode` for arithmetic operations is added, as are
      pattern synonyms for the supported operations. These are:

      -   LUA_OPADD
      -   LUA_OPSUB
      -   LUA_OPMUL
      -   LUA_OPDIV
      -   LUA_OPIDIV
      -   LUA_OPMOD
      -   LUA_OPPOW
      -   LUA_OPUNM
      -   LUA_OPBNOT
      -   LUA_OPBAND
      -   LUA_OPBOR
      -   LUA_OPBXOR
      -   LUA_OPSHL
      -   LUA_OPSHR

  -   Added ersatz functions `hslua_arith` and `hsluaL_requiref`,
      wrapping `lua_artih` and `luaL_requiref`, respectively. Both
      functions catch any error resulting from the call.

  -   Made types `OPCode`, `StatusCode`, and `GCCode` instances of
      type class `Show`.

  -   The `Show` instances of Integer and Number now behave like
      those of the wrapped types. Both types are now also instance
      of `Read`.

  -   Removed `hslua_userdata_gc` from `hslua.h`.

  ## lua-2.0.2

  Released 2021-11-26.

  -   Make sure lualib.h is available through this package. The
      header file contains info on how and under which name the
      standard library is loaded.

  ## lua-2.0.1

  Released 2021-11-03.

  -   Added bindings to `lua_rotate` and `lua_version`.

  ## lua-2.0.0.1

  Released 2021-10-30.

  -   Only install includes when using the Lua code shipped with the
      package (Ellie Hermaszewska). Cabal no longer tries to install
      the header files if a system-wide installation is used.

  ## lua-2.0.0

  Released 2021-10-21.

  -   Module hierarchy moved from `Foreign.Lua.Raw` to `Lua`.

  -   Documentation has been improved.

  -   Added new function `withNewState` to run Lua operations.

  -   New modules `Lua.Ersatz` containing all bindings to safe
      ersatz functions.

  -   Higher level and enum types have been removed, only the
      low-level “code” types are kept in this package.

  -   Constants are now represented as pattern synonyms like
      `LUA_OK`.

  -   Provide bindings to more functions:

      -   `lua_is...` type-checking functions;
      -   `lua_pushstring` to push plain CStrings;
      -   auxiliary functions
          -   `luaL_loadfile`, and
          -   `luaL_loadfilex`;
      -   unsafe functions
          -   `lua_gettable`,
          -   `lua_settable`,
          -   `lua_getglobal`, and
          -   `lua_setglobal`.

  -   The function `lua_pop` now expects a `CInt` instead of a
      `StackIndex`.

  -   New StackIndex constructor functions `nthTop`, `nthBottom`,
      `nth`, and `top`.

  -   Avoid unnecessary modification of HSFUN metatable.

  -   Various cleanups and test improvements.

  ## lua-1.0.0

  Released 2021-02-18.

  -   Initially created. Contains all modules in the
      `Foreign.Lua.Raw` hierarchy from `hslua-1.3`. Documentation
      has been improved.

  [![AppVeyor Status]](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/tarleb/hslua-r2y18)
  [![Hackage]](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lua)

  The *lua* package provides a Lua interpreter as well as bindings,
  wrappers and types to combine Haskell and Lua.

  Overview
  --------

  [Lua](https://lua.org) is a small, well-designed, embeddable
  scripting language. It has become the de-facto default to make
  programs extensible and is widely used everywhere from servers
  over games and desktop applications up to security software and
  embedded devices. This package provides Haskell bindings to Lua,
  enable coders to embed the language into their programs, making
  them scriptable.

  This package ships with the official Lua interpreter, version
  5.4.4. Cabal flags allow to compile against a system-wide Lua
  installation instead, if desired.

  Build flags
  -----------

  The following cabal build flags are supported:

  - `system-lua`: Use the locally installed Lua version instead of
    the version shipped as part of this package.

  - `pkg-config`: Use *pkg-config* to discover library and include
    paths. Setting this flag implies `system-lua`.

  - `allow-unsafe-gc`: Allow optimizations which make Lua's garbage
    collection potentially unsafe; enabling this should be safe if
    there are no callbacks into Haskell during Lua garbage
    collection cycles. The flag should be *disabled* if Lua objects
    can have Haskell finalizers, i.e., `__gc` metamethods that call
    Haskell function.

    The flag is *enabled* per default, as Haskell functions are
    rarely used in finalizers. It can help to disable the flag if
    there are issues related to Lua's garbage collection.

  - `apicheck`: Compile Lua with its API checks enabled.

  - `lua_32bits`: Compile Lua for a 32-bits system (e.g., i386,
    PowerPC G4).

  - `export-dynamic`: Add all symbols to dynamic symbol table;
    disabling this will make it possible to create fully static
    binaries, but renders loading of dynamic C libraries impossible.

  ### Example: using a different Lua version

  To use a system-wide installed Lua when linking *lua* as a
  dependency, build/install your package using
  `--constraint="lua +system-lua"`. For example, you can
  install Pandoc with hslua that uses system-wide Lua like this:

  ``` sh
  cabal install pandoc --constraint="lua +system-lua"
  ```

  or with stack:

  ``` sh
  stack install pandoc --flag=lua:system-lua
  ```
