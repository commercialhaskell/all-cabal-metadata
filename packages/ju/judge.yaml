changelog: "Changelog for judge\n===============================================================================\n\nAll
  notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\n\nThe format is
  based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)\nand this project
  adheres to the [Haskell Package Versioning \nPolicy](https://pvp.haskell.org/).\n\nUnreleased\n----------\n\n[0.1.3.0]
  - 2018-03-14\n----------------------\n\n### Changed\n\n    * Changed name and description
  of data files.\n    * Fixed bug that caused assumptions not to be simplified.\n\n\n\n[0.1.2.0]
  - 2018-01-19\n----------------------\n\n### Changed\n\n    * Logic files in the
  designated data directories can now be specified \n      without extension, but
  must not occur in a subdirectory.\n\n### Removed\n\n    * Many previously exposed
  internal functions are now hidden.\n\n\n\n[0.1.1.0] - 2018-01-18\n----------------------\n\n###
  Added\n\n    * Tableaux are now postprocessed to remove obviously superfluous rules.\n
  \   * Tableaux now document which formulas triggered branch closure.\n\n### Removed\n\n
  \   * The `negation` and `contradicts` functions have been removed. \n    \n###
  Changed\n\n    * Closure is now exclusively triggered on properly signed formulas
  --- no \n      longer on finding `[T] A` and `[T] A -> 0`, and no longer on finding
  \n      `[T] A` for some assumption `A`.\n\n\n\n[0.1.0.0] - 2018-01-17\n----------------------\n\n###
  Added\n\n    * First versioned release. Although it is the first version, the \n
  \     application has been incubating for a while and should be mostly stable. \n
  \     The commit history will take you deeper into the past.\n"

description: "judge\n==============================================================================\n\n`judge`
  is a modular implementation of a decision procedure for classical and \njustification
  logics, through a tableau-based theorem prover. \n\n\n\nInstallation\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n`judge`
  can be installed through \n[Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/):\n\n
  \   cabal sandbox init\n    cabal install judge\n\n\nA recommended alternative is
  to use [Stack](https://www.stackage.org/), for \nwhich you will need to clone the
  repository and do:\n\n    stack install\n\n\n\nUsage\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n`judge`
  expects a logical system to be defined in the [YAML](http://yaml.org/) \nor [JSON](http://json.org/)
  format. This file will specify the type of proof \nsystem and the logical family
  (although at the moment, only the respective \nvalues `tableau` and `justification`
  are recognised). It also provides the \nrules of inference. See the [logic](logic)
  directory for example \nspecifications.\n\nIf no target formula(s) are provided
  via `-g`, formulas are read off the \nstandard input. If no output file is provided
  via `-o`, the result is written \nto the standard output. By default, the format
  is plain text; add `-f LaTeX` \nto obtain LaTeX code instead. \n\nFor example, the
  following will construct proofs for [theorems](formulas.txt) \nof the logic [LP](logic/LP.yml)
  (with `c:(A→B→A) ∊ CS`), and produces a PDF \nfile to visualise them:\n\n    judge
  LP \\\n        -a \"c:(A->B->A)\" \\\n        -f LaTeX \\\n         < formulas.txt
  \\\n         | pdflatex\n\n\n\nContributing\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotable
  missing features are detailed on the [issue \ntracker](https://github.com/slakkenhuis/judge/issues).\n\nContributions
  that extend `judge` to different logical families (modal, first \norder...) or proof
  systems (sequent, natural deduction...) are welcomed.\n\n"
