  JuPyTer notebook parser
  =======================
  [JuPyTer](https://jupyter.org/) was formerly called IPython notebook.

  It is cross-language interactive data science platform
  that allows for interactive editing of code and visualizing its results.

  This library allows to directly parse `.ipynb` files, and process them.

  There is an example script `jupyter-extract` that just extracts
  all the source code cells, and prints them.

  Initial version was generated with [`json-autotype`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/json-autotype)
