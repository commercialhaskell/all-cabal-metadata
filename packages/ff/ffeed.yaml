description: "= hsffeed - Programming FriendFeed from Haskell =\r\n\r\n'hsffeed' is
  a Haskell package providing a binding to\r\nthe FriendFeed API - \r\n\r\n  http://friendfeed.com/api/\r\n
  \ http://code.google.com/p/friendfeed-api/wiki/ApiDocumentation\r\n\r\nThe binding
  is functionally complete (Nov 2008), letting you write\r\napplications in Haskell
  that accesses and manipulates content on\r\nFriendFeed and the sites it aggregates.\r\n\r\n=
  Getting started =\r\n\r\nFor some code samples showing you how to get started using
  this\r\nAPI binding, have a look in the examples/ directory. \r\n\r\n= Building
  and installing =\r\n\r\nThis package is provided in Cabal form, so only thing you
  need to\r\ndo to get going is:\r\n\r\n  foo% runghc Setup configure\r\n  foo% runghc
  Setup build \r\n  foo% runghc Setup install\r\n\r\nThe package depends on a bunch
  of other packages though, so you\r\nneed to have them built&installed, as well.
  They are:\r\n\r\n  * HTTP: http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/HTTP\r\n
  \ * json:  http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/json\r\n  *
  utf8-string: http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/utf8-string\r\n\r\n=
  Authentication =\r\n\r\nWhen using this API binding to build your own FriendFeed
  application, \r\nauthenticated calls require a user's remote key. This key is available\r\nto
  logged-in FriendFeed users via http://www.friendfeed.com/remotekey\r\n\r\n= Feedback
  / question =\r\n\r\nPlease send them to sof@forkIO.com , and I'll try to respond
  to them\r\nas best/quickly as possible.\r\n"
