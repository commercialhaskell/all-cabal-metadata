  Integer Sequences with error prediction\n\n\n## The problem\n\n\nIn many situations,
  we have finite sequences of integer values, and we would like to predict which would
  be the next one, or the next several ones, without the knowledge of the mathematical
  definition of the sequence. \n\nA solution based just on the available data has
  applications on the following areas, among others:\n\n- time series forecasting\n-
  uncertain prediction\n- data modeling\n- risk modeling\n- data encoder decoder\n\n##
  A geometric way of prediction \n\n\n### Simple base solution\n\nWe start with a
  simple geometric solution, that is to calculate the ratio (quotient) of the last
  value relative to the previous one, and apply it to the last value to calculate
  the next one. \n\nFor example, if we have some values of the Fibonacci sequence:
  \n\n    fibo = [1,2,3,5,8,13]\n\nwe get the ratios of each element relative to its
  previous one: \n\n    percents fibo\n    [2.0,1.5,1.6666666666666667,1.6,1.625]\n\nThen,
  we predict the next element as the product of the last element by the last ratio:
  \n\n    13 * 1.625 = 21.125\n\n\n### Improving the result with the prediction of
  the error\n\nWe can get the predicted value for each subsequence of initial values
  of the original sequence. \n\n    drop 2 (inits fibo)\n    [[1,2],[1,2,3],[1,2,3,5],[1,2,3,5,8],[1,2,3,5,8,13]]\n\n
  \   fmap predict1 it\n    [4.0,4.5,8.333333333333334,12.8,21.125]\n\nThen, we can
  calculate the difference between the predicted value and the real value. This way,
  we get a sequence of the errors, and we can calculate the predicted value of the
  next error, wich we will add to the simple prediction, notably improving the result.
  \n\n    err = zipWith subtract it (drop 2 fibo)\n    [-1.0,0.5,-0.3333333333333339,0.1999999999999993]\n\n
  \   predict1 it\n    -0.1333333333333331\n\n    21.125 - 0.1333333333333331 = 20.991666666666667\n\nWe
  round the result to get the integer predicted value. \n\n\n### Sequences with quasi-cyclic
  pattern\n\nWhen a sequence is not monothonic, we assume that it has a repetitive
  pattern, so that the ratio used for prediction will be the one of the element whose
  value is closest to the last element. \n\nFor example, in the next sequence, the
  value closest to the last one is the first `3`, and the ratio of that position is
  `4/3`, so the predicted value will be `3*(4/3)`:\n\n    percents [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,1,2,3]\n
  \   [2.0,1.5,1.3333333333333333,1.25,0.2,2.0,1.5,1.3333333333333333,0.25,2.0,1.5]\n\n
  \   predict1 [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,1,2,3]\n    4.0\n\n\n### Recursive layers of predictions\n\nOnce
  we have predicted the next value of a sequence, we can append it to the original
  sequence and predict another element. We can do this as many times as we want. We
  call \"layers\" to the number of recursions. Then, if we apply 3 layers to our fibonacci
  secuence `fib = [1,2,3,5,8,13]`, we get 3 more values: \n\n    probnet 3 fibo\n
  \   [1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55]\n\n\n## Problems and limitations\n\nThe geometric way,
  that is, a way based on ratios of values, can only be valid for non-zero values,
  and is not suitable for sequences with negative and positive values. In that case
  it should be more appropiate the use of a usual diferential method, which can be
  very simmilar to the one presented here, but using diferences of elements instead
  of quotients of elements. \n\nThe case of zero values is not solved here. The function
  will just return an error if any element is 0. \n\n\n## Tecnical details\n\n###
  Data types\n\nThe type signature of the function is such that any `RealFrac` data
  type can be used for the values of the elements in the input sequence. The internal
  calculations will be done in that data type, preserving the precicion of it. \n\nFor
  example, if the type is a 32 bit `Float`, the calculus would be made with about
  21 decimal digits of precision, but if the input elements are `Rational`, the intermediate
  calculus would preserve infinite precision, until the rounding for the ÃŒnteger`
  output. That is the reason for importing `Data.Ratio`. \n\n    fibo = [1,2,3,5,8,13
  :: Float]\n    predic1 fibo\n    21.125\n\n    fibo = [1,2,3,5,8,13 :: Rational]\n
  \   predict1 fibo\n    169 % 8\n\nIt also implies that the input sequence can not
  be of any `Integral` type, it must be previously converted to a `RealFrac` type
  by using, for example, `fromInteger` conversion function. It is done this way on
  the testing file `test-probnet.hs`. \n\n### Arithmetic equivalent method\n\nIt can
  be noticed that an arithmetic, instead of geometric, method for the extrapolation
  can be coded by just changing the `quotient` `sub-function in the `percents` function
  by the standard `subtract`, and the product (*) in the `predict1` function by addition
  (+).\n\nSuch method would not require that every element in the sequence be different
  than 0, and the method would be suitable for sequences with negative and positive
  values. \n\n\n## Testing\n\nThe file `test-probnet.hs` contains a function `testoeis`
  to bulk testing the function `probnet` against a range of OEIS sequences, giving
  the numbers after the 'A' on the OEIS sequence ID. \n\n    testoeis 1 20\n    [(\"A3\",[1,1,1,1,2,2,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,3,4,4,2,3,4,2,6,3,2,6,4,3,4,4,4,6,4,2,6,4,4,8,4,3,6,4,4,5,4,4,6,6,4,6,6,4,8,4,2,9,4,6,8,4,4,8,8,3,8,8,4,7,4,4,10,6,6,8,4,5,8,6,4,9,8,4,10,6,4,12,8,6,6,4,8,8,8,4,8,6,4]),(\"A12\",[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1])]\n\nThe
  testing is made using just the first 10 values for predicting the 11 one, and comparing
  it with the real 11th element, counting it as valid when both, predicted and real,
  are equal. \n\n\n## Applications for encode and decode sequence data when follows
  a math pattern extrapolable with the method. \n\n### Encode data sequence\nConvert
  data sequence to f = (index,frac1,frac2,frac3,longitude)\n\nConvert data secuence
  to a function / symbol dictionary and replace sequence patterns for the symbol\n\nexample
  parse 1,2,3,4,5,8,16.... / output -> (.,30,1,1,1),(,,10,2,4,8) .....,,\n\nThe idea
  is convert different values in the same symbol, always the data value is in the
  sequence, in decode moment, replace the function symbol by the element in the index
  of the data sequence.\n\n\t- add split patterns function to the dictionary\n\t-
  rewrite sequence to new function symbols\n\t- rewrite base for encoding\n\t- output
  dictionary + rewrited symbols sequence\n\t- Compare bit size to ensure encoding
  improvement, otherwise return the same data\n\nTo find the proper functions just
  to calculate the entropy of the data by frequency. Match more popular factors in
  the data set and elaborate functions/symbol for each one following the steps, always
  use less bits symbols to replace the most popular functions in the data set.\n\nThe
  content data of 20 elements of the sequence fibonacci can be stored in (20,1,1,2)
  something less than :\n\n[1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597,2584,4181,6765,10946,17711,28657,46368,75025]\n\n\nCompresed

  vs 9 , and less with better encoding for decimal data for this case, because just
  are 3 symbols x 2 bit for each one , 6 bits\n\n\n\n\n### Decode data sequence\n\nConvert
  encoded probnet function parameters to data sequence\n\nConvert encoded data sequence
  to real data converting each symbol by his element in the dictionary function data
  secuence .\n\n        - get dictionary function\n\t- replace funcion data secuence
  by function elements to generate the real data sequence\n\t- output results\n\t-
  return no function dictionary was found , or no functionon decoding for this sequence,
  if input data is not in the correct data type.\n\n\n\n### Math\n\n\tsequence = [1,2,3,5]\n\n\tf1(x,y)
