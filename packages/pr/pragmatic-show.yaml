description: |-
  The standard 'Show' class is handy for quickly viewing any Haskell
  values without having to think about formatting. However, it often
  produces needlessly clunky string representations, which are difficult
  to parse by eye. This package offers a drop-in replacement which
  attempts to keep the representation as short as possible.
