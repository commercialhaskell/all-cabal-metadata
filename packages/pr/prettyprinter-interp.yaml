  # Revision history for prettyprinter-interp

  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2023-01-31

  * `d__i'E` and `d__i'L` are renamed to `__di'E` and `__di'L` and the existing
    names are kept as deprecated aliases that will be removed in version 0.3. The
    original names were a mistake that was overlooked.

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2022-10-02

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.
