  ## Version 0.3.0.1

  *released Thu, 27 Apr 2023*

  It turns out that even if `cabal check` shows no warnings, Hackage
  doesn't accept packages with very old cabal version constraints. So
  this release bumps that, which in turns makes `cabal check` actually
  start to show warnings, so modernise the cabal file as a result.

  There are no code changes compared to 0.3.0, so this is a no-op
  release from the point of view of functionality.

  ## Version 0.3.0

  *released Wed, 26 Apr 2023*

  * Add the new quecto/ronto/ronna/quetta units. I didn't think I'd ever
    have to extend the list of units! Not sure entirely if these should
    be part of the parseKMGT function, since they're high enough to be
    out of normal computer units, but they do have lower/upper versions,
    so adding them seems the right thing.

  ## Version 0.2.0

  *released Sun, 22 Nov 2015*

  * Incompatible API change to cleanup some initial design decisions:
    the two level `FormatOption`/`FormatMode` model is removed, the
    fixed unit of `FormatOption` is moved to a new constructor
    `FormatMode`, and `FormatOption` is removed entirely. This should be
    a simpler API, at the cost of breaking compatibility.
  * Fixed issue #3 (No support for negative numbers).
  * Worked around issue #1 (Add 'base' unit) by adding a mode that
    disables scaling; it should have the same effect without introducing
    an artificial unit.

  ## Version 0.1.0.2

  *released Sun, 23 Nov 2014*

  * Trivial release for compatibility with QuickCheck 2.7 and older
    HUnit packages as found in Wheezy.
  * The release switches the test suite to use Cabal macros, which might
    create issues in some cases.
  * Fixed issue #2 (Wrong formatting for small numbers in SI mode).

  ## Version 0.1.0.1

  *released Mon, 19 May 2014*

  * Trivial release updating upper package bounds (for testing),
    updating homepage/related settings as part of move to github, and
    fixing a few documentation issues.

  ## Version 0.1.0

  *released Thu, 03 May 2012*

  * Initial release.

  prefix-units package
  ====================

  This package defines a datatype (`Unit`) and associated
  parsing/formatting functions so that command line applications can
  handle "nice" values like:

      $ cmd create-file foo 100G
      Done.
      $ cmd ls-file foo
      Size is 100Gi
      $ cmd ls-files
      foo 100Gi
      bar  14Ki

  And so on. For details on the API, look at the Haddock documentation
  for the `Data.Prefix.Units` module.

  For building and installing, `cabal configure` and related commands
  are enough. Run `cabal configure --enable-tests && cabal build &&
  cabal test` if you want to run the unit-tests.

  The library is designed to have very few dependencies (only base and a
  few GHC extensions), so that it's trivial to use it in projects. Hence
  the use of some hand-coded conversions instead of using
  TemplateHaskell to generate them automatically.

  TODO
  ----

  The current interface of the library works, but is not nicely
  composable. I'm still looking for a nicer way to expose the parsing
  functionality.

  Currently, the IEC (binary) and SI units are mixed in the same
  data-type. This works, but at some level I think two separate types
  would be more "correct", at the expense of a more complex API.

  The RationalConvertible type class has only a few instances; ideally
  we'd have `instance Integral a => RationalConvertible a` and similar
  for `Fractional`, but this doesn't work as such in Haskell, so we're
  stuck with the manual derivation.

  The current behaviour is case-sensitive for all units in `ParseExact`
  mode, which means that one has to use (in this mode) `Ki` for the
  binary unit `Kibi`. This seems suboptimal, since the binary units are
  unique irrespective of casing.
