description: |-
  Sometimes you need to assume something at runtime that you can't prove in the
  type system. When you do that, you should make sure you get a good error
  message if ever your assumption turns out to be wrong. That's what this library
  is for.

  Use the functions in here to get high quality error messages for when your
  invariants don't hold at runtime. The functions all pretty print any Haskell
  values given to them, which makes it easier to understand what's going on when
  your code breaks.
