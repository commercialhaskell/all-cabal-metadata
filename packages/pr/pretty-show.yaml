changelog: |
  Changes in 1.10
    * Add support for quasi-quotes, as the preferred way of dealing
      with non-properly showable things.

  Changes in 1.9.5
    * Add a `PrettyVal` instance for `Data.Fixed`

  Changes in 1.9.4
    * Fix issue #35

  Changes in 1.9.3
    * Fix issue #34

  Changes in 1.9.2
    * Allow VARSYM as infix constructors

  Changes in 1.9.1
    * Allow keywords as the name of constructors

  Changes in 1.9
    * Add support for pre-processing values before printing.
      In particular, we add a pre-processor which will hide some constructors
      from the output.

  Changes in 1.8.2
    * Switch to using version 3.3.1 of jquery (jquery 1 seems to be long gone)

  Changes in 1.8
    * Rejigger the rendering of unusal values, to improve the rendering of datres.
      - a sequence of values with negative numbers is turned into an infix con
      - change the association when sequences meet infix things

  Changes in 1.7
    * Add a dependency on package Text
      - Adds an instance for `PrettyVal Text`
      - Paves the road for using `Text` in the representation of values.

  Changes in 1.6.16
    * Fixes to accomodate GHC 8.4

  Changes in 1.6.13
    * Parse things like <function> and <Function> as constructors

  Changes in 1.6.12
    * Treat reserved operators as infix constructors (best effort kind of thing)

  Changes in 1.6.11
    * Add `pPrint`, which is `putStrLn . ppShow`

  Changes in 1.6.10
    * Increase the precedence of unary minus

  Changes in 1.6.9
    * Relax parsing of atoms, so that we can support things like the show
      instance of StdGen (e.g., [ 123 45, 786 10 ])

  Changes in 1.6.8.2:
    * Correct license in srouce files.

  Changes in 1.6.8.1:
    * Correct the 'License' field in the Cabal file to match the license (MIT)

  Changes in 1.6.8:
    * Move source-repository pragma to top-level.

  Changes in 1.6.5:
    * Rename CHANGES to CHANGELOG to work with hackage.

  Changes in 1.6.4:
    * Drop dependency on happy >= 1.19

  Changes in 1.6.3:
    * Add Safe Haskell annotations
    * Add CHANGES file
    * Add generated parser to package again.  We do this, because otherwise
      the package fails to build on systems that do not have `happy`.
      This is a bit questionable, but hopefully it won't be too much of
      a problem.

description: |-
  We provide a library and an executable for working with derived 'Show'
  instances. By using the library, we can parse derived 'Show' instances into a
  generic data structure. The @ppsh@ tool uses the library to produce
  human-readable versions of 'Show' instances, which can be quite handy for
  debugging Haskell programs.  We can also render complex generic values into
  an interactive Html page, for easier examination.
