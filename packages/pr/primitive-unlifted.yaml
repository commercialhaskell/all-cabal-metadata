  # Changelog
  All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

  The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
  and this project adheres to the [Haskell Package Versioning Policy](https://pvp.haskell.org/).

  ## 2.1.0.0 -- 2023-06-28

  * Change the order of the type arguments to `UnliftedArray_` and
    `MutableUnliftedArray_`. This makes the library work better with
    the typeclasses in the `contiguous` library.

  ## 2.0.0.0 -- 2023-06-27

  * Use legitimate unlifted primitive types and operations, only supporting
    GHC 9.4 and newer.

  ## 1.0.0.0 -- 2020-11-02

  * Redo everything. This uses `unsafeCoerce#` a lot to coerce between
    lifted and unlifted types. Stay on the 0.1.x.x series unless you need
    something from this newer version.

  ## 0.1.3.0 -- 2020-01-23

  * Add `PrimUnlifted` instances for `ShortText` and `ShortByteString`.
  * Add `singletonUnliftedArray`.

  ## 0.1.2.0 -- 2019-07-08

  * Add `PrimUnlifted` instances for `MVar`, `IORef`, and `STRef`.

  ## 0.1.1.0 -- 2019-05-23

  * Cannot remember what happened in this release.

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2019-05-17

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

description: |-
  Primitive GHC types with unlifted types inside. There used
  to be a module named `Data.Primitive.UnliftedArray` in the
  `primitive` library. However, it turns out that it is impossible
  to write such an API safely in versions of GHC before 8.10.1, thanks
  to some nasty interactions between unsafe coercions and the foreign
  function interface. This package also uses a somewhat different,
  and more flexible, approach than that module did.
