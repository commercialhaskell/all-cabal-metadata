synopsis: Instrument applications with metrics and publish/push to Prometheus
changelog: ! "# 1.1.0\n\n- `Prometheus.GHC.ghcStats` now has the type `m (Maybe (IO
  ThreadId))`.\n  \n  This was changed to clarify what happens if GC stats aren't
  enabled, in which case you'll just get `Nothing` back.\n \n  Don't forget to actually
  run the stats collector thread though! For example,\n  \n  ```haskell\n  (startGhcStats,
  registry) <- buildRegistry ghcStats\n  for_ startGhcStats id\n  ```\n\t\n\t\n# 1.0.0\n\nInitial
  release.\n"

description: ! '[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) is an open-source systems monitoring
  and

  alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. Since its inception in 2012,

  many companies and organizations have adopted Prometheus, and the project has a

  very active developer and user community. It is now a standalone open source

  project and maintained independently of any company. To emphasize this and

  clarify the project''s governance structure, Prometheus joined the Cloud Native

  Computing Foundation in 2016 as the second hosted project after Kubernetes.


  This library provides a Haskell client to Prometheus. It supports:


  * The metric types __counter__, __gauge__ and __histogram__.

  * Publishing metrics over HTTP (via WAI middleware).

  * Pushing metrics to the Prometheus push gateway.

  * Labels, along with dynamic labels.

  * Instrumentation, both for internal Prometheus monitoring and GHC statistics.'
