  ### 0.3.2 [2024.04.20]
  * Add `Data.Proxyless.RequiredTypeArguments`, a variant of `Data.Proxyless`
    which uses `RequiredTypeArguments` instead of `TypeApplications`.

  ### 0.3.1 [2019.02.20]
  * Make the build warning-free under `-Wcompat`.

  ## 0.3
  * Update for GHC 8.2
    * Since `typeRep#`, `typeNatTypeRep`, and `typeSymbolTypeRep` are no longer
      exported from `base`, `theTypeRep#`, `theTypeNatTypeRep`, and
      `theTypeSymbolTypeRep` are now synonyms for `theTypeRep`
    * Happily, the new type signature for `GHC.OverloadedLabels.fromLabel` is now
      exactly the same as `theFromLabel`, so the latter is now a synonym for the
      former
  * Use explicit kind variable binders in `Data.Proxyless`
  * Use explicit `forall`s in `Data.Proxied` for consistency

  ## 0.2
  * Added the `Data.Proxyless` module
  * Added `proxyHashed` to `Data.Proxied`

  ### 0.1.1
  * Enabled `Safe`

  ## 0.1
  * Initial commit

  `proxied` is a simple library that exports a function to convert constant functions to ones that take a `proxy` value in the `Data.Proxied`. This is useful for retrofiting typeclasses that have functions that return a constant value for any value of a particular type (but still need to consume some value, since one of the parameterized types must appear in a typeclass function). Often, these functions are given `undefined` as an argument, which might be considered poor design.

   `Proxy`, however, does not carry any of the error-throwing risks of `undefined`, so it is much more preferable to take `Proxy` as an argument to a constant function instead of `undefined`. Unfortunately, `Proxy` wasn't included in `base` until GHC 7.8, so many of `base`'s typeclasses still contain constant functions that aren't amenable to passing `Proxy`. `proxied` addresses this issue by providing variants of those typeclass functions that take an explicit `proxy` value.

  This library also contains the `Data.Proxyless` module, which works in the opposite direction. That is, one can take functions which take `Proxy` (or `undefined`) as an argument and convert them to functions which take no arguments. This trick relies on the `-XTypeApplications` extension, so it is only available with GHC 8.0 or later. This library also offers `Data.Proxyless.RequiredTypeArguments`, a variant of `Data.Proxyless` that uses `-XRequiredTypeArguments` to make type arguments explicit, which is only available with GHC 9.10 or later.
