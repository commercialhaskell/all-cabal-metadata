  # Changelog

  ## 0.1.0.1

  ### Updated
  * CI now supports GHC versions 9.6.2, 9.4.5, 9.2.8, 9.0.2, and 8.10.7.

  ## 0.1.0.0

  ### Added
  * `Math.NumberTheory.Prime.Count.FFI`, with FFI bindings to all functions from the
    `primecount` library.
  * `Math.NumberTheory.Prime.Count`, with high-level wrappers (`primePi`,
    `nthPrime`, and `primePhi`) around the functions in
    `Math.NumberTheory.Prime.Count.FFI`.
  * Test coverage of `primePi`, `nthPrime`, and `primePhi` with `tasty-hunit`.
  * Benchmarks of `primePi`, `nthPrime`, and `primePhi` with `tasty-bench`.
  * Full Haddock documentation coverage.
  * Support for GHC 9.2.1, 9.0.1, 8.10.7, 8.8.4, 8.6.5, and 8.4.4, and
    libprimecount v7.x, verified by GitHub Actions.

  # `primecount` for Haskell
  [![Haskell-CI](https://github.com/pgujjula/primecount-haskell/actions/workflows/haskell-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pgujjula/primecount-haskell/actions/workflows/haskell-ci.yml)

  This library provides Haskell bindings to Kim Walisch's
  [primecount](https://github.com/kimwalisch/primecount) library.

  ## Build instructions
  First follow the
  [directions](https://github.com/kimwalisch/primecount#installation)
  for installing `libprimecount`. As stated in the directions, if you are
  installing through your system's package manager, make sure to get the
  development version of the primecount package, which might have a name like
  `primecount-devel`. The current version of the Haskell bindings supports any
  version of `libprimecount >= 7.0`.

  Then you can build the Haskell bindings with Stack or Cabal, and read the
  documentation.
  ```
  # Stack
  stack build
  stack test
  stack haddock primecount --open

  # Cabal
  cabal update
  cabal build
  cabal test
  cabal haddock  # and then open the documentation manually
  ```

  ### Building `libprimecount` from source
  If you build and install the original `primecount` library from source, instead
  of through a package manager, then you need to make sure that your Haskell build
  system knows where to find it. For example, on Linux `libprimecount` might be
  installed to `/usr/local/lib64`.

  Then if using Stack, add the following lines to your `stack.yaml` or your global
  `~/.stack/config.yaml`:
  ```
  extra-lib-dirs:
  - /usr/local/lib64
  extra-include-dirs:
  - /usr/local/include
  ```
  If using Cabal, add the following lines to your `~/.cabal/config`:
  ```
  extra-lib-dirs:
    /usr/local/lib64
  extra-include-dirs:
    /usr/local/include
  ```
  or pass
  `--extra-lib-dirs=/usr/local/lib64 --extra-include-dirs=/usr/local/include`
  as an argument to Cabal.
