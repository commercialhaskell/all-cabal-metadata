changelog: "propellor (5.17) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Apt: Enable the non-free-firmware
  section, when used with Debian\n    bookworm or newer.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>
  \ Sat, 10 Jun 2023 09:49:05 -0400\n\npropellor (5.16) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * Debootstrap: Added UseOldGpgKeyring constructor to DebootstrapConfig,\n    which
  allows bootstrapping ancient stable releases of Debian.\n  * Qemu: Install binfmt-support
  along with qemu-user-static.\n  * Fix build with unix-2.8.0.0 and with unix-compat-0.7.\n\n
  -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Mon, 29 May 2023 11:24:25 -0400\n\npropellor (5.15)
  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Improve propellor's MetaTypes implementation to
  avoid an expontential\n    blowup when several MetaTypes fail to unify. This should
  result in less\n    memory use by ghc when there's a type error.\n  * Avoid OOM
  when built by ghc 9.2.\n  * Thanks to the ghc developers for their assistance, particularly
  spj\n    and Sam Derbyshire.\n  * Remove workaround to ghc using a lot of memory
  displaying an error\n    message about a property of a host having the wrong number
  of\n    arguments. This brings back clear error messages in such situations.\n\n
  -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Tue, 15 Nov 2022 15:34:11 -0400\n\npropellor (5.14)
  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Removed Propellor.Property.OpenID module, since
  the simpleid package\n    got removed from Debian.\n  * Renamed Linode.mlocateEnabled
  to Linode.locateEnabled, and made it also\n    make sure plocate is enabled, if
  it's installed rather than mlocate.\n    (API change)\n  * Debootstrap.built: Stop
  using the deprecated qemu-debootstrap\n    for bootstrapping foreign architectures.
  It is not needed since qemu\n    2.12, which, at least on Debian, enabled the \n
  \   binfmt-support --fix-binary option.\n  * Qemu.removeHostEmulationBinary: Removed
  this property, which is no\n    longer necessary since qemu-debootstrap is not used.\n
  \   (API change)\n  * Flashkernel.installed: Deal with a behavior change in flash-kernel,\n
  \   which will fail to install if is not configured first.\n  * Systemd.resolvConfed
  is no longer enabled by default in systemd\n    containers. It is probably not necessary
  on current systems the way it\n    was back in 2014, and this avoids a problem where
  the host's\n    /etc/resolv.conf gets overwritten when systemd is managing the\n
  \   container's /etc/resolv.conf. \n  * Borg: To support borg 1.2, run borg compact
  to free up space after pruning.\n  * Add lower bounds on async and split.\n    Thanks,
  Simon Jakobi\n  * propellor.cabal: Deduplicate exposed modules, which fixes a build\n
  \   problem with recent cabal versions.\n    Thanks, Simon Jakobi\n\n -- Joey Hess
  <id@joeyh.name>  Sat, 15 Oct 2022 14:40:31 -0400\n\npropellor (5.13) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * Network: Added support for network interfaces with several address\n    stanzas,
  eg ipv4 and ipv6.\n    Thanks, Nicolas Schodet\n  * Sudo.enabledFor: Deal with new
  @includedir syntax in sudoers file.\n  * Apt.securityUpdates: Stop generating testing-security
  lines, as\n    testing-security is unused per debian documentation.\n  * Utility.HumanNumber:
  Fix rounding bug that could result in\n    sometimes quite wrong values, eg \"1.1
  GB\" when the input value was a\n    few bytes less than 2 GB. Properties in Ccache
  and Journald that\n    used it to generate config files were affected by this bug.\n\n

  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Worked around a situation where ghc uses insane
  amounts of memory\n    displaying an error message about a property of a host having
  the\n    wrong number of arguments.\n  * Added libghc-type-errors-dev to debian/control
  recommends, and\n    install it if available when bootstrapping propellor.\n  *
  Borg: add UseUmask to BorgRepoOpt.\n    Thanks, Nicolas Schodet\n  * Borg: use \"{now}\"
  instead of $(date ...)\n    Thanks, Nicolas Schodet\n  * Makefile: Deal with cabal
  change that made sdist\n    not output tarball to stdout.\n    Thanks, Sean Whitton\n\n

  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Fix display of concurrent output from processes
  when using\n    Propellor.Property.Conductor.\n    (Reversion introduced in version
  5.5.0.)\n  * Support bootstrapping to hosts using cabal 3.x, with new-dist directory.\n
  \ * Makefile: Fix build with cabal 3.x.\n  * Borg.restored: Fix restoration, which
  has apparently never worked,\n    at least back to borg 1.0.9.\n    Thanks, Nicolas
  Schodet.\n  * Borg.init: Added the now required encryption type parameter.\n    Thanks,
  Nicolas Schodet.\n    (API change)\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Fri, 14 Aug
  2020 16:02:14 -0400\n\npropellor (5.10.2) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Fix build
  with ghc 8.6.3.\n    Thanks, Robin Munn\n  * Bootstrap: Fix typo in Arch Linux dependencies.\n
  \   Thanks, Robin Munn\n  * Bootstrap: Add haskell-type-errors package on Arch Linux.\n
  \   Thanks, Robin Munn\n  * Apt.buildDepIn: Run build-dep command in a temporary

  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  [ Joey Hess ]\n  * Localdir.hasOriginUrl: Depend on
  Git.installed.\n  * Localdir.hasOriginUrl: Type changed from UnixLike to DebianLike\n
  \   because Git.installed is not implemented for other unixes.\n    (API change)\n
  \ * Changed the ChrootBootstrapper type class's buildchroot method\n    to take
  a Info parameter, instead of Maybe System.\n    (The System can be extracted from
  the Info.)\n    (API change)\n\n  [ Sean Whitton ]\n  * Chroot.{de,}bootstrapped
  uses the chroot's configured apt proxy and\n    mirror, if these exist, when debootstrapping
  the chroot.\n  * Rename Sbuild.useHostProxy -> Chroot.useHostProxy. (API change)\n\n
  -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Fri, 15 Nov 2019 13:26:19 -0400\n\npropellor (5.9.1)
  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Apt: Debian has changed the name of the suite for
  testing security updates\n    from testing to testing-security.\n  * Apt: Also the
  suite for stable releases from bullseye on will be\n    suffixed with \"-security\".\n
  \ * Apt.update: Pass --allow-releaseinfo-change when updating Unstable\n    or Testing,
  so that code name changes that happen in those suites\n    during a stable release
  don't prevent updating the rolling suites.\n  * Systemd.machined: Fix a bug that
  caused the systemd-container package\n    to not be installed when used with Debian
  buster.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Wed, 17 Jul 2019 15:59:29 -0400\n\npropellor
  (5.9.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Added custom type error messages when Properties
  don't combine due to\n    conflicting MetaTypes.\n  * Added custom type error messages
  for ensureProperty and tightenTargets.\n  * Note that those changes made ghc 8.0.1
  in a few cases unable to infer\n    types when ensureProperty or tightenTargets
  is used, while later ghc\n    versions had no difficulty. If this affects building
  your properties,\n    adding a type annotation to the code will work around the
  problem.\n  * Added custom type error messages displayed when type inference\n    fails
  when using ensureProperty and tightenTargets, that suggest\n    adding a type annotation.\n
  \ * Use the type-errors library to detect when the type checker gets stuck\n    unable
  to reduce type-level operations on MetaTypes, and avoid \n    displaying massive
  error messages.\n  * But, since type-errors is a new library not available in eg
  Debian\n    yet, added a WithTypeErrors build flag. When the library is not\n    available,
  cabal will automatically disable that build flag,\n    and it will build without
  the type-errors library.\n  * EnsurePropertyAllowed, TightenTargetsAllowed, and
  CheckCombinable\n    types have changed to Constraint.\n    (API change)\n  * Try
  harder to avoid displaying an excessive amount of type error\n    messages when
  many properties have been combined in a props list.\n  * Libvirt.installed: install
  libvirt-daemon-system\n    Thanks, David Bremner\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>
  \ Tue, 02 Jul 2019 16:27:07 -0400\n\npropellor (5.8.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * Fix bug in File.containsShellSetting that replaced whole shell conffile\n    content
  with the setting if the file did not previously contain a line\n    setting the
  key to some value.\n  * Removed inChroot, instead use hasContainerCapability FilesystemContained.\n
  \   (API change)\n  * Hostname: Properties that used to not do anything in a systemd
  or\n    docker container will now change the container's hostname,\n    since it's
  namespaced.\n  * Add User.ownsWithPrimaryGroup\n    Thanks, Sean Whitton\n  * Ssh.userKeys,
  Ssh.userKeyAt: Create .ssh directory when it does not yet\n    exist.\n  * Ssh.userKeyAt:
  When a relative filepath is provided, it's put inside\n    the user's .ssh directory.\n

  Sbuild.osDebianStandard to all Sbuild.built\n    calls which have osDebian.\n    Thanks,

  \ * withOS had a type level bug that allowed ensureProperty to be used inside\n
  \   it with a Property that does not match the type of the withOS itself.\n    (API
  change)\n    The fix may cause some of your valid uses of withOS to no longer type\n
  \   check; the best way to work around that is to use pickOS to pick between\n    several
  properties that are further specialized using withOS.\n    For an example of how
  to do that, see the source code to\n    Propellor.Property.Borg.installed\n  * Propellor.Property.Cron.runPropellor
  is a Property DebianLike; it was\n    incorrectly a Property UnixLike before and
  that wrong type was hidden by\n    the withOS bug.\n  * Some openbsd portability
  fixes. Thanks, rsiddharth.\n  * Added Libvirt module. Thanks, Sean Whitton.\n  *
  When bootstrapping on Debian, libghc-stm-dev may not be available,\n    as it's
  become part of ghc, so check before trying to install it.\n  * Fix build with ghc
  8.6.3.\n  * Avoid exposing the constructor of OuterMetaTypesWitness, to avoid\n
  \   the kind of mistake that led to the withOS bug.\n  * Merged Utility changes

  (Any old lines it wrote to /etc/sudoers will be removed.)\n    This fixes a potential
  ordering problem; the property used to append\n    the line to /etc/sudoers, but
  that would override more specific lines\n    in the include directory.\n  * Borg:

  when\n    the versions in stable satisfy the requested backport's dependencies.\n
  \   The new property installs only the listed packages from backports;\n    all
  other dependencies come from stable.\n    So in some cases, you may need to list

  support for building propellor with ghc 7 (as in debian\n    oldstable), to avoid
  needing to depend on the semigroups transitional\n    package, but also because
  it's just too old to be worth supporting.\n  * stack.yaml: Updated to lts-9.21.\n

  slides at\n    Linux.Conf.Au 2017 in January. Now that it's not vaporware, it allows\n
  \   one Host to build a disk image that has all the properties of another\n    Host.\n
  \ * DiskImage building properties used to propagate DNS info out from\n    the chroot
  used to build the disk image to the Host. That is no longer\n    done, since that
  chroot only exists as a side effect of the disk image\n    creation and servers
  will not be running in it.\n  * The IsInfo types class's propagateInfo function
  changed to use a\n    PropagateInfo data type. (API change)\n  * The action used
  to satisfy a property changed to Maybe (Propellor Result).\n    When it is Nothing,
  propellor knows it can skip displaying the\n    description of that property. This
  is mostly useful in the\n    implementation of mempty. (API change)\n  * The doNothing

  -0400\n\npropellor (3.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Property types have been
  improved to indicate what systems they target.\n    This prevents using eg, Property
  FreeBSD on a Debian system.\n    Transition guide for this sweeping API change:\n
  \   - First, upgrade to propellor 2.17.2 and deploy that to all your hosts.\n      Otherwise,
  propellor --spin will fail when you upgrade to\n      propellor 3.0.0.\n    - Change
  \"host name & foo & bar\"\n      to     \"host name $ props & foo & bar\"\n    -
  Similarly, `propertyList` and `combineProperties` need `props`\n      to be used
  to combine together properties; they no longer accept\n      lists of properties.
  (If you have such a list, use `toProps`.)\n    - And similarly, Chroot, Docker,
  and Systemd container need `props`\n      to be used to combine together the properies
  used inside them.\n    - The `os` property is removed. Instead use `osDebian`, `osBuntish`,\n
  \     or `osFreeBSD`. These tell the type checker the target OS of a host.\n    -
  Change \"Property NoInfo\" to \"Property UnixLike\"\n    - Change \"Property HasInfo\"
  to \"Property (HasInfo + UnixLike)\"\n    - Change \"RevertableProperty NoInfo\"
  to\n      \"RevertableProperty UnixLike UnixLike\"\n    - Change \"RevertableProperty
  HasInfo\" to\n      \"RevertableProperty (HasInfo + UnixLike) UnixLike\"\n    -
  GHC needs {-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-} to use these fancy types.\n      This is
  enabled by default for all modules in propellor.cabal. But\n      if you are using
  propellor as a library, you may need to enable it\n      manually.\n    - If you
  know a property only works on a particular OS, like Debian\n      or FreeBSD, use
  that instead of \"UnixLike\". For example:\n      \"Property Debian\"\n    - It's
  also possible make a property support a set of OS's, for example:\n      \"Property
  (Debian + FreeBSD)\"\n    - Removed `infoProperty` and `simpleProperty` constructors,
  instead use\n      `property` to construct a Property.\n    - Due to the polymorphic
  type returned by `property`, additional type\n      signatures tend to be needed
  when using it. For example, this will\n      fail to type check, because the type
  checker cannot guess what type\n      you intend the intermediate property \"go\"
  to have:\n        foo :: Property UnixLike\n        foo = go `requires` bar\n \t
  \ where\n \t\tgo = property \"foo\" (return NoChange)\n      To fix, specify the
  type of go:\n \t  \tgo :: Property UnixLike\n    - `ensureProperty` now needs to
  be passed a witness to the type of the \n      property it's used in.\n      change
  this:  foo = property desc $ ... ensureProperty bar\n      to this:      foo = property'
  desc $ \\w -> ... ensureProperty w bar\n    - General purpose properties like cmdProperty
  have type \"Property UnixLike\".\n      When using that to run a command only available
  on Debian, you can\n      tighten the type to only the OS that your more specific
  property works on.\n      For example:\n        upgraded :: Property Debian\n        upgraded
  = tightenTargets (cmdProperty \"apt-get\" [\"upgrade\"])\n    - Several utility
  functions have been renamed:\n      getInfo to fromInfo\n      propertyInfo to getInfo\n
  \     propertyDesc to getDesc\n      propertyChildren to getChildren\n  * The new
  `pickOS` property combinator can be used to combine different\n    properties, supporting
  different OS's, into one Property that chooses\n    which to use based on the Host's
  OS.\n  * Re-enabled -O0 in propellor.cabal to reign in ghc's memory use handling\n
  \   these complex new types.\n  * Added dependency on concurrent-output; removed
  embedded copy.\n  * Apt.PPA: New module, contributed by Evan Cofsky.\n  * Improved
  propellor's first run experience; propellor --init will\n    walk the user through
  setting up ~/.propellor, with a choice between\n    a clone of propellor's git repository,
  or a minimal config, and will\n    configure propellor to use a gpg key.\n  * Stack
  support. \"git config propellor.buildsystem stack\" will make\n    propellor build
  its config using stack. (This does not affect\n    how propellor is bootstrapped
  on a host by \"propellor --spin host\".)\n  * When propellor is installed using
  stack, propellor --init will\n    automatically set propellor.buildsystem=stack.\n\n

  or\n    RevertableProperty NoInfo. (API change)\n    Transition guide:\n      -
  If you define a RevertableProperty, expect some type check\n        failures like:
  \"Expecting one more argument to ‘RevertableProperty’\".\n      - Change it to \"RevertableProperty
  NoInfo\"\n      - The compiler will then tell you if it needs \"HasInfo\" instead.\n
  \     - If you have code that uses the RevertableProperty constructor\n        that
  fails to type check, use the more powerful <!> operator\n        instead to create
  the RevertableProperty.\n  * Various property combinators that combined a RevertableProperty\n
  \   with a non-revertable property used to yield a RevertableProperty.\n    This
  was a bug, because the combined property could not be fully\n    reverted in many

  using grub.\n  * Add a ChrootTarball chroot type, for using pre-built tarballs\n
  \   as chroots. Thanks, Ben Boeckel.\n  * HostName: Improve domain extraction code.\n
  \ * Added Mount.fstabbed property to generate /etc/fstab to replicate\n    current
  mounts.\n  * HostName: Improve domain extraction code.\n  * Add File.basedOn. Thanks,
  Per Olofsson.\n  * Changed how the operating system is provided to Chroot (API change).\n
  \   Where before debootstrapped and bootstrapped took a System parameter,\n    the
  os property should now be added to the Chroot.\n  * Follow-on change to Systemd.container,
  which now takes a System parameter.\n  * Generalized Property.check so it can be
  used with Propellor actions as\n    well as IO actions.\n  * Hostname.sane and Hostname.setTo
  can now safely be used as a property\n    of a chroot, and won't affect the hostname
  of the host system.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Fri, 23 Oct 2015 17:38:32

  a very different Propellor.Property.ControlHeir.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>
  \ Tue, 20 Oct 2015 21:29:12 -0400\n\npropellor (2.9.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * Added basic Uwsgi module, maintained by Félix Sipma.\n  * Add Apt.hasForeignArch.
  Thanks, Per Olofsson.\n  * Improved documentation, particularly of the Propellor
  module.\n  * The Propellor module no longer exports many of the things it used to,\n
  \   being now focused on only what's needed to write config.hs.\n    Use Propellor.Base
  to get all the things exported by Propellor before.\n    (API change)\n  * Some
  renaming of instance methods, and moving of functions to more\n    appropriate modules.
  (API change)\n  * Added File.isSymlinkedTo. Thanks, Per Olofsson.\n  * fileProperty,
  and properties derived from it now write the new\n    file content via origfile.propellor-new~,
  instead of to a randomly named\n    temp file. This allows them to clean up any
  temp file that may have\n    been left by an interrupted run of propellor.\n  *
  Added Propellor.Property.Spin, which can be used to make a host be a\n    controller
  of other hosts, which will automatically spin them each time\n    propellor is run.\n
  \ * Ssh.keyImported is replaced with Ssh.userKeys. (API change)\n    The new property
  only gets the private key from the privdata; the\n    public key is provided as
  a parameter, and so is available as\n    Info that other properties can use.\n  *
  Ssh.keyImported' is renamed to Ssh.userKeyAt, and also changed\n    to only import
  the private key from the privdata. (API change)\n  * While Ssh.keyImported and Ssh.keyImported'
  avoided updating existing\n    keys, the new Ssh.userKeys and Ssh.userKeyAt properties
  will\n    always update out of date key files.\n  * Ssh.pubKey renamed to Ssh.hostPubKey.
  (API change)\n  * Added --unset-unused \n  * Fix typo: propigate → propagate. Thanks,
  Felix Gruber.\n    (A minor API change)\n  * Chroot: Converted to use a ChrootBootstrapper
  type class, so\n    other ways to bootstrap chroots can easily be added in separate\n
  \   modules. (API change)\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Tue, 20 Oct 2015 15:43:12

  etc when building propellor, by updating\n    the executable atomically.\n  * Added
  Logcheck module, contributed by Jelmer Vernooij.\n  * Added Kerberos module, contributed
  by Jelmer Vernooij.\n  * Privdata that uses HostContext inside a container will
  now have the\n    name of the container as its context, rather than the name of\n
  \   the host(s) where the container is used. This allows eg, having different\n
  \   passwords for a user in different containers. Note that previously,\n    propellor
  would prompt using the container name as the context, but\n    not actually use
  privdata using that context; so this is a bug fix.\n  * Fix --add-key to not fail
  committing when no privdata file exists yet.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sun,
  04 Oct 2015 13:54:59 -0400\n\npropellor (2.8.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  *
  Added Propellor.Property.Rsync.\n  * Convert Info to use Data.Dynamic, so properties
  can export and consume\n    info of any type that is Typeable and a Monoid, including
  data types\n    private to a module. (API change)\n    Thanks to Joachim Breitner
  for the idea.\n  * Improve propellor wrapper to better handle installation cloning\n
  \   the public propellor repo, by setting that repo to be upstream,\n    so propellor
  doesnt try to push to a read-only repo.\n  * Added DebianMirror module, contributed
  by Félix Sipma.\n  * Some hlint cleanups.\n    Thanks, Mario Lang\n  * Added Propellor.Property.Unbound
  for the caching DNS server.\n    Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * Added PTR to Dns.Record.
  While this is ignored by\n    Propellor.Property.Dns for now, since reverse DNS
  setup is not\n    implemented there yet, it can be used in other places, eg Unbound.\n
  \   Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * PrivData converted to newtype (API change).\n  * Stopped
  stripping trailing newlines when setting PrivData;\n    this was previously done
  to avoid mistakes when pasting eg passwords\n    with an unwanted newline. Instead,
  PrivData consumers should use either\n    privDataLines or privDataVal, to extract
  respectively lines or a\n    value (without internal newlines) from PrivData.\n
  \ * Allow storing arbitrary ByteStrings in PrivData, extracted using\n    privDataByteString.\n
  \ * Added Aiccu module, contributed by Jelmer Vernooĳ.\n  * Added --rm-key.\n\n

  for Windows-style .ini\n    files, and generic support for files containing some
  sort of sections.\n    Thanks, Sean Whitton for completing the implementation.\n
  \ * Added Propellor.Property.LightDM\n    Thanks, Sean Whitton.\n  * Multiple Tor.hiddenService
  properties can now be defined for a host;\n    previously only one such property
  worked per host.\n    Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Tue,

  WithoutPassword\n    and ForcedCommandsOnly (API change)\n  * setSshdConfig type
  changed, and setSshdConfigBool added with old type.\n  * Fix a bug in shim generation
  code for docker and chroots, that\n    sometimes prevented deployment of docker
  containers.\n  * Added onChangeFlagOnFail which is often a safer alternative to\n
  \   onChange.\n    Thanks, Antoine Eiche.\n  * Work around broken git pull option
  parser in git 2.5.0,\n    which broke use of --upload-pack to send a git push when
  running\n    propellor --spin.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Thu, 30 Jul 2015
  12:05:46 -0400\n\npropellor (2.6.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Replace String
  type synonym Docker.Image by a data type\n    which allows to specify an image name
  and an optional tag. (API change)\n    Thanks, Antoine Eiche.\n  * Added --unset
  to delete a privdata field.\n  * Version dependency on exceptions.\n  * Systemd:
  Add masked property.\n    Thanks, Sean Whitton\n  * Fix make install target to work
  even when git is not configured.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Fri, 10 Jul 2015
  22:36:29 -0400\n\npropellor (2.5.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * cmdProperty'
  renamed to cmdPropertyEnv to make way for a new,\n    more generic cmdProperty'
  (API change)\n  * Add docker image related properties.\n    Thanks, Antoine Eiche.\n
  \ * Export CommandParam, boolSystem, safeSystem, shellEscape, and\n    createProcess
  from Propellor.Property.Cmd, so they are available\n    for use in constricting
  your own Properties when using propellor\n    as a library.\n  * Improve enter-machine
  scripts for systemd-nspawn containers to unset most\n    environment variables.\n
  \ * Fix Postfix.satellite bug; the default relayhost was set to the\n    domain,
  not to smtp.domain as documented.\n  * Mount /proc inside a chroot before provisioning
  it, to work around #787227\n  * --spin now works when given a short hostname that
  only resolves to an\n    ipv6 address.\n  * Added publish property for systemd-spawn
  containers, for port publishing.\n    (Needs systemd version 220.)\n  * Added bind
  and bindRo properties for systemd-spawn containers.\n  * Firewall: Port was changed
  to a newtype, and the Port and PortRange\n    constructors of Rules were changed
  to DPort and DportRange, respectively.\n    (API change)\n  * Docker: volume and
  publish accept Bound FilePath and Bound Port,\n    respectively. They also continue
  to accept Strings, for backwards\n    compatibility.\n  * Docker: Added environment
  property.\n    Thanks Antoine Eiche.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Tue, 09 Jun
  2015 17:08:43 -0400\n\npropellor (2.4.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Propellor
  no longer supports Debian wheezy (oldstable).\n  * Git.bareRepo: Fix bug in calls
  to userScriptProperty.\n    Thanks, Jelmer Vernooij.\n  * Removed Obnam.latestVersion
  which was only needed for Debian wheezy\n    backport.\n  * Merged Utility changes
  from git-annex.\n  * Switched from MonadCatchIO-transformers to the newer transformers
  and\n    exceptions libraries.\n  * Ensure build deps are installed before building
  propellor in --spin\n    and cron job, even if propellor was already built before,
  to deal with\n    upgrades that add new dependencies.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>
  \ Wed, 06 May 2015 14:28:59 -0400\n\npropellor (2.3.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * Make propellor resistent to changes to shared libraries, such as libffi,\n    which
  might render the propellor binary unable to run. This is dealt with\n    by checking
  the binary both when running propellor on a remote host,\n    and by Cron.runPropellor.
  If the binary doesn't work, it will be rebuilt.\n  * Note that since a new switch
  had to be added to allow testing the binary,\n    upgrading to this version will
  cause a rebuild from scratch of propellor.\n  * Added hasLoginShell and shellEnabled.\n
  \ * debCdn changed to new httpredir.debian.org official replacement for\n    http.debian.net.\n
  \ * API change: Added User and Group newtypes, and Properties that\n    used to
  use the type UserName = String were changed to use them.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>

  \   improve process name visible in ps.\n  * Add shebang to cron.daily etc files.
  \n  * Some changes to tor configuration, minor API change.\n  * Propellor now builds
  itself, and gets its build dependencies installed\n    when deploying to a new host,
  without needing the Makefile.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Mon, 09 Mar 2015
  12:02:31 -0400\n\npropellor (2.1.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Additional tor

  etc.\n  * New Cron.Times data type, which allows Cron.job to install\n    daily/monthly/weekly
  jobs that anacron can run. (API change)\n  * Fix Git.daemonRunning to restart inetd
  after enabling the git server.\n  * Ssh.authorizedKey: Make the authorized_keys

  \ * Property has been converted to a GADT, and will be Property NoInfo\n    or Property
  HasInfo.\n    This was done to make sure that ensureProperty is only used on\n    properties
  that do not have Info.\n    Transition guide:\n    - Change all \"Property\" to
  \"Property NoInfo\" or \"Property HasInfo\"\n      (The compiler can tell you if
  you got it wrong!)\n    - To construct a RevertableProperty, it is useful to use
  the new\n      (<!>) operator\n    - Constructing a list of properties can be problimatic,
  since\n      Property NoInto and Property HasInfo are different types and cannot\n
  \     appear in the same list. To deal with this, \"props\" has been added,\n      and
  can built up a list of properties of different types,\n      using the same (&)
  and (!) operators that are used to build\n      up a host's properties.\n  * Add
  descriptions of how to set missing fields to --list-fields output.\n  * Properties
  now form a tree, instead of the flat list used before.\n    This includes the properties
  used inside a container.\n  * Fix info propagation from fallback combinator's second
  Property.\n  * Added systemd configuration properties.\n  * Added journald configuration
  properties.\n  * Added more network interface configuration properties.\n  * Implemented
  OS.preserveNetwork.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sun, 25 Jan 2015 15:23:08

  -0400\n\npropellor (1.3.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * --spin checks if the
  DNS matches any configured IP address property\n    of the host, and if not, sshes
  to the host by IP address.\n  * Detect #774376 and refuse to use docker if the system
  is so broken\n    that docker exec doesn't enter a chroot.\n  * Update intermediary
  propellor in --spin --via\n  * Added support for DNSSEC.\n  * Ssh.hostKey and Ssh.hostKeys
  no longer install public keys from\n    the privdata. Instead, the public keys are
  included in the\n    configuration. (API change)\n  * Ssh.hostKeys now removes any
  host keys of types that the host is not\n    configured to have.\n  * sshPubKey
  is renamed to Ssh.pubKey, and has an added SshKeyType\n    parameter. (API change)\n
  \ * CloudAtCost.deCruft no longer forces randomHostKeys.\n  * Fix build with process

  on which is set.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Wed, 17 Dec 2014 16:30:44 -0400\n\npropellor
  (1.2.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Display a warning when ensureProperty is

  \ * --spin target --via relay causes propellor to bounce through an\n    intermediate
  relay host, which handles any necessary uploads\n    when provisioning the target
  host.\n  * --spin can be passed multiple hosts, and it will provision each host\n
  \   in turn.\n  * Add --merge, to combine multiple --spin commits into a single,
  more useful\n    commit.\n  * Hostname parameters not containing dots are looked
  up in the DNS to\n    find the full hostname.\n  * propellor --spin can now deploy
  propellor to hosts that do not have \n    git, ghc, or apt-get. This is accomplished
  by uploading a fairly\n    portable precompiled tarball of propellor.\n  * Propellor.Property.OS
  contains properties that can be used to do a clean\n    reinstall of the OS of an
  existing host. This can be used, for example,\n    to do an in-place conversion
  from Fedora to Debian.\n    This is experimental; use with caution!\n  * Added group-related
  properties. Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * Added Git.barerepo. Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n
  \ * Added Grub.installed and Grub.boots properties.\n  * New HostContext can be
  specified when a PrivData value varies per host.\n  * hasSomePassword and hasPassword
  now default to using HostContext.\n    To specify a different context, use hasSomePassword'
  and\n    hasPassword' (API change)\n  * hasSomePassword and hasPassword now make
  sure shadow passwords are enabled.\n  * cron.runPropellor now runs propellor, rather
  than using its Makefile.\n    This is more robust.\n  * propellor.debug can be set
  in the git config to enable more persistent\n    debugging output.\n  * Run apt-cache
  policy with LANG=C so it works on other locales.\n  * endAction can be used to register
  an action to run once propellor\n    has successfully run on a host.\n\n -- Joey

  urgency=medium\n\n  * propellor --spin can now be used to update remote hosts, without\n
  \   any central git repository needed. The central git repository is\n    still
  useful for running propellor from cron, but this simplifies\n    getting started
  with propellor, and allows for more ad-hoc usage.\n  * The git repo url, if any,
  is updated whenever propellor --spin is used.\n  * Added prosody module, contributed
  by Félix Sipma.\n  * Can be used to configure tor hidden services. Thanks, Félix
  Sipma.\n  * When multiple gpg keys are added, ensure that the privdata file\n    can
  be decrypted by all of them.\n  * Convert GpgKeyId to newtype. (API change)\n  *
  DigitalOcean.distroKernel property now reboots into the distribution\n    kernel

  the os property for a stable system includes the suite name\n    to use, eg Stable
  \"wheezy\".\n  * stdSourcesList uses the stable suite name, to avoid unwanted\n

  2014 01:12:19 -0400\n\npropellor (0.8.1) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Run apt-get
  update in initial bootstrap.\n  * --list-fields now includes a table of fields that
  are not currently set,\n    but would be used if they got set.\n  * Remove .gitignore
  from cabal file list, to avoid build failure on Debian.\n    Closes: #754334\n\n
  -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 09 Jul 2014 22:11:31 -0400\n\npropellor (0.8.0)
  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Completely reworked privdata storage. There is now
  a single file,\n    and each host is sent only the privdata that its Properties
  actually use.\n\n    To transition existing privdata, run propellor against a host
  and\n    watch out for the red failure messages, and run the suggested commands\n
  \   to store the privdata using the new storage scheme. You may find\n    it useful
  to run the old version of propellor to extract data from the old\n    privdata files
  during this migration.\n\n    Several properties that use privdata now require a
  context to be\n    specified. If in doubt, you can use anyContext, or\n    Context
  \"hostname.example.com\"\n\n  * Add --edit to edit a privdata value in $EDITOR.\n
  \ * Add --list-fields to list all currently set privdata fields, along with\n    the
  hosts that use them.\n  * Fix randomHostKeys property to run openssh-server's postinst
  in a\n    non-failing way.\n  * Hostname.sane now cleans up the 127.0.0.1 localhost
  line in /etc/hosts,\n    to avoid eg, apache complaining \"Could not reliably determine
  the\n    server's fully qualified domain name\".\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>
  \ Sun, 06 Jul 2014 18:28:08 -0400\n\npropellor (0.7.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * combineProperties no longer stops when a property fails; now it continues\n
  \   trying to satisfy all properties on the list before propigating the\n    failure.\n
  \ * Attr is renamed to Info. (API change)\n  * Renamed wrapper to propellor to make
  cabal installation of propellor work.\n  * When git gpg signature of a fetched git
  branch cannot be verified,\n    propellor will now continue running, but without
  merging in that branch.\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 13 Jun 2014 10:06:40
  -0400\n\npropellor (0.6.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Docker containers now
  propagate DNS attributes out to the host they're\n    docked in. So if a docker
  container sets a DNS alias, every container\n    it's docked in will automatically
  be added to a DNS round-robin,\n    when propellor is used to manage DNS for the
  domain.\n  * Apt.stdSourcesList no longer needs a suite to be specified. (API change)\n
  \ * Added --dump to dump out a field of a host's privdata. Useful for editing\n
  \   it.\n  * Propellor's output now includes the hostname being provisioned, or\n
  \   when provisioning a docker container, the container name.\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>
  \ Thu, 05 Jun 2014 17:32:14 -0400\n\npropellor (0.5.3) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * Fix unattended-upgrades config for !stable.\n  * Ensure that kernel hostname
  is same as /etc/hostname when configuring\n    hostname.\n  * Added modules for
  some hosting providers (DigitalOcean, CloudAtCost).\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>
  \ Thu, 29 May 2014 14:29:53 -0400\n\npropellor (0.5.2) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * A bug that caused propellor to hang when updating a running docker\n    container
  appears to have been fixed. Note that since it affects\n    the propellor process
  that serves as \"init\" of docker containers,\n    they have to be restarted for
  the fix to take effect.\n  * Licence changed from GPL to BSD.\n  * A few changes
  to allow building Propellor on OSX. One user reports\n    successfully using it
  there.\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 17 May 2014 16:42:55 -0400\n\npropellor
  (0.5.1) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Primary DNS servers now have allow-transfer
  automatically populated\n    with the IP addresses of secondary dns servers. So,
  it's important\n    that all secondary DNS servers have an ipv4 (and/or ipv6) property\n
  \   configured.\n  * Deal with old ssh connection caching sockets.\n  * Add missing
  build deps and deps. Closes: #745459\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 24
  Apr 2014 18:09:58 -0400\n\npropellor (0.5.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Removed
  root domain records from SOA. Instead, use RootDomain\n    when calling Dns.primary.
  (API change)\n  * Dns primary and secondary properties are now revertable.\n  *
  When unattendedUpgrades is enabled on an Unstable or Testing system,\n    configure
  it to allow the upgrades.\n  * New website, https://propellor.branchable.com/\n\n
  -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Apr 2014 17:38:02 -0400\n\npropellor (0.4.0)
  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Propellor can configure primary DNS servers, including
  generating\n    zone files, which is done by looking at the properties of hosts\n
  \   in a domain.\n  * The `cname` property was renamed to `alias` as it does not
  always\n    generate CNAME in the DNS. (API change)\n  * Constructor of Property
  has changed (use `property` function instead).\n    (API change)\n  * All Property
  combinators now combine together their Attr settings.\n    So Attr settings can
  be made inside a propertyList, for example.\n  * Run all cron jobs under chronic
  from moreutils to avoid unnecessary\n    mails.\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>
  \ Sat, 19 Apr 2014 02:09:56 -0400\n\npropellor (0.3.1) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * Merge scheduler bug fix from git-annex.\n  * Support for provisioning hosts
  with ssh and gpg keys.\n  * Obnam support.\n  * Apache support.\n  * Postfix satellite
  system support.\n  * Properties can now be satisfied differently on different operating\n
  \   systems.\n  * Standard apt configuration for stable now includes backports.\n
  \ * Cron jobs generated by propellor use flock(1) to avoid multiple\n    instances
  running at a time.\n  * Add support for SSH ed25519 keys.\n    (Thanks, Franz Pletz.)\n\n
  -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 17 Apr 2014 20:07:33 -0400\n\npropellor (0.3.0)
  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * ipv6to4: Ensure interface is brought up automatically
  on boot.\n  * Enabling unattended upgrades now ensures that cron is installed and\n
  \   running to perform them.\n  * Properties can be scheduled to only be checked
  after a given time period.\n  * Fix bootstrapping of dependencies.\n  * Fix compilation
  on Debian stable.\n  * Include security updates in sources.list for stable and testing.\n
  \ * Use ssh connection caching, especially when bootstrapping.\n  * Properties now
  run in a Propellor monad, which provides access to\n    attributes of the host.
  (API change)\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 11 Apr 2014 01:19:05 -0400\n\npropellor
  (0.2.3) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * docker: Fix laziness bug that caused running
  containers to be\n    unnecessarily stopped and committed.\n  * Add locking so only
  one propellor can run at a time on a host.\n  * docker: When running as effective
  init inside container, wait on zombies.\n  * docker: Added support for configuring
  shared volumes and linked\n    containers.\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue,
  08 Apr 2014 02:07:37 -0400\n\npropellor (0.2.2) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  *
  Now supports provisioning docker containers with architecture/libraries\n    that
  do not match the host.\n  * Fixed a bug that caused file modes to be set to 600
  when propellor\n    modified the file (did not affect newly created files).\n\n
  -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 04 Apr 2014 01:07:32 -0400\n\npropellor (0.2.1)
  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * First release with Debian package.\n\n -- Joey Hess
  <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 03 Apr 2014 01:43:14 -0400\n\npropellor (0.2.0) unstable;
  urgency=low\n\n  * Added support for provisioning Docker containers.\n  * Bootstrap
  deployment now pushes the git repo to the remote host\n    over ssh, securely.\n
  \ * propellor --add-key configures a gpg key, and makes propellor refuse\n    to
  pull commits from git repositories not signed with that key.\n    This allows propellor
  to be securely used with public, non-encrypted\n    git repositories without the
  possibility of MITM.\n  * Added support for type-safe reversions. Only some properties
  can be\n    reverted; the type checker will tell you if you try something that won't\n
  \   work.\n  * New syntactic sugar for building a list of properties, including\n
  \   revertable properties.\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 02 Apr 2014

description: "[Propellor](https://propellor.branchable.com/) is a\nconfiguration management
  system using Haskell and Git.\nEach system has a list of properties, which Propellor
  ensures\nare satisfied.\n[Linux](http://propellor.branchable.com/Linux/) and\n[FreeBSD](http://propellor.branchable.com/FreeBSD/)
  are supported.\n\nPropellor is configured via a git repository, which typically
  lives\nin `~/.propellor/` on your development machine. Propellor clones the\nrepository
  to each host it manages, in a \n[secure](http://propellor.branchable.com/security/)
  way. See \n[components](http://propellor.branchable.com/components/)\nfor details.\n\nProperties
  are defined using Haskell in the file `~/.propellor/config.hs`.\nThere is fairly
  complete \n[API documentation](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/),\nwhich
  includes many built-in Properties for dealing with\n[Apt](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/docs/Propellor-Property-Apt.html)\nand\n[Apache](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/docs/Propellor-Property-Apache.html),\n[Cron](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/docs/Propellor-Property-Cron.html)\nand\n[Commands](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/docs/Propellor-Property-Cmd.html),\n[Dns](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/docs/Propellor-Property-Dns.html)\nand\n[Docker](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/docs/Propellor-Property-Docker.html),
  etc.\n\nThere is no special language as used in puppet, ansible, etc.. just\nthe
  full power of Haskell. Hopefully that power can be put to good use in\nmaking declarative
  properties that are powerful, nicely idempotent, and\neasy to adapt to a system's
  special needs!\n\nIf using Haskell to configure Propellor seems intimidating,\nsee
  [configuration for the Haskell newbie](https://propellor.branchable.com/haskell_newbie/).\n\n##
  quick start\n\n1. Get propellor installed on your development machine (ie, laptop).\n
  \    `apt-get install propellor`\n          or\n     `cabal install propellor`\n
  \         or\n     `cabal unpack propellor; cd propellor-version; stack install`\n2.
  Run `propellor --init` ; this will set up a `~/.propellor/` git\n   repository for
  you.\n3. Edit `~/.propellor/config.hs`, and add a host you want to manage.\n   You
  can start by not adding any properties, or only a few.\n4. Run: `propellor --spin
  $HOST`\n5. Now you have a simple propellor deployment to a host. Continue editing\n
  \  `~/.propellor/config.hs` to further configure the host, add more hosts\n   etc,
  and re-run `propellor --spin $HOST` after each change.  \n6. Once you have a lot
  of hosts, and running `propellor --spin HOST` for\n   each host becomes tiresome,
  you can\n   [automate that](http://propellor.branchable.com/automated_spins/).\n7.
  Write some neat new properties and send patches!\n\n(Want to get your feet wet with
  propellor before plunging in?\n[try this](http://propellor.branchable.com/forum/Simple_quickstart_without_git__44___SSH__44___GPG))\n"
