changelog: ! "propellor (3.4.1) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Fixed https url to
  propellor git repository.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Wed, 01 Mar 2017 16:50:05
  -0400\n\npropellor (3.4.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Added ConfigurableValue
  type class, for values that can be used in a\n    config file, or to otherwise configure
  a program.\n  * The val function converts such values to String.\n  * Removed fromPort
  and fromIPAddr (use val instead). (API change)\n  * Removed several Show instances
  that were only used for generating\n    configuration, replacing with ConfigurableValue
  instances. (API change)\n  * The github mirror of propellor's git repository has
  been removed,\n    since github's terms of service has started imposing unwanted
  licensing\n    requirements.\n  * propellor --init: The option to clone propellor's
  git repository\n    used to use the github mirror, and has been changed to use a
  different\n    mirror.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Wed, 01 Mar 2017 16:44:20
  -0400\n\npropellor (3.3.1) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Apt: Removed the mirrors.kernel.org
  line from stdSourcesList etc.\n    The mirror CDN has a new implementation that
  should avoid the problems\n    with httpredir that made an extra mirror sometimes
  be needed.\n  * Switch Debian CDN address to deb.debian.org.\n  * Tor.hiddenService:
  Fix bug in torrc's HiddenServicePort configuration.\n    Thanks, Félix Sipma\n\n
  -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Mon, 20 Feb 2017 13:49:26 -0400\n\npropellor (3.3.0)
  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Arch Linux is now supported by Propellor!\n    Thanks
  to Zihao Wang for this port.\n  * Added Propellor.Property.Pacman for Arch's package
  manager.\n    Maintained by Zihao Wang.\n  * The types of some properties changed;
  eg from Property DebianLike\n    to Property (DebianLike + ArchLinux). Also, DebianLike
  and Linux\n    are no longer type synonyms; propellor now knows that Linux includes\n
  \   ArchLinux. This could require updates to code, so is a minor API change.\n  *
  GHC's fileSystemEncoding is used for all String IO, to avoid\n    encoding-related
  crashes in eg, Propellor.Property.File.\n  * Add --build option to simply build
  config.hs.\n  * More informative usage message. Thanks, Daniel Brooks\n  * Tor.hiddenService'
  added to support multiple ports.\n    Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * Apt.noPDiffs added.\n
  \   Thanks, Sean Whitton.\n  * stack.yaml: Compile with GHC 8.0.1 against lts-7.16.\n
  \   Thanks, Andrew Cowie.\n  * Added Propellor.Property.File.configFileName and
  related functions\n    to generate good filenames for config directories.\n  * Added
  Apt.suiteAvailablePinned, Apt.pinnedTo.\n    Thanks, Sean Whitton.\n  * Added File.containsBlock\n
  \   Thanks, Sean Whitton.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Tue, 07 Feb 2017 12:09:24
  -0400\n\npropellor (3.2.3) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Improve extraction of
  gpg secret key id list, to work with gpg 2.1.\n  * The propellor wrapper checks
  if ./config.hs exists; if so it runs\n    using the configuration in the current
  directory, rather than\n    ~/.propellor/config.hs\n  * Debootstap: Fix too tight
  permissions lock down of debootstrapped\n    chroots, which prevented non-root users
  from doing anything in the\n    chroot.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Tue, 22
  Nov 2016 11:36:18 -0400\n\npropellor (3.2.2) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Added
  Linode.serialGrub property.\n  * Clean up build warnings about redundant constraints
  when built with ghc 8.0.\n  * Added Group.hasUser property. Thanks, Daniel Brooks\n\n
  -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Fri, 11 Nov 2016 17:54:44 -0400\n\npropellor (3.2.1)
  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Simplify Debootstrap.sourceInstall since #770217
  was fixed.\n  * Debootstap.installed: Fix inverted logic that made this never install\n
  \   debootstrap. Thanks, mithrandi.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Mon, 03 Oct
  2016 18:06:31 -0400\n\npropellor (3.2.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  [ Sean Whitton
  ]\n  * Using ccache with Sbuild.built & Sbuild.builtFor is now toggleable: these\n
  \   properties now take a parameter of type Sbuild.UseCcache.  (API Change)\n  *
  Sbuild.piupartsConf: no longer takes an Apt.Url. (API Change)\n  * Sbuild.piupartsConf
  & Sbuild.piupartsConfFor: does nothing if corresponding\n    schroot not built.\n
  \   Previously, these properties built the schroot if it was missing.\n  * Sbuild.built
  & Sbuild.piupartsConf: add an additional alias to sid chroots.\n    This is for
  compatibility with `dgit sbuild`.\n  * Further improvements to Sbuild.hs haddock.\n\n
  \ [ Joey Hess ]\n  * Tor.hiddenService: Converted port parameter from Int to Port.
  (API change)\n  * Tor.hiddenServiceAvailable: The hidden service hostname file may
  not\n    be available immedaitely after configuring tor; avoid ugly error in\n    this
  case.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sat, 10 Sep 2016 11:39:40 -0400\n\npropellor
  (3.1.2) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  [ Joey Hess ]\n  * Ssh.knownHost: Bug fix:
  Only fix up the owner of the known_hosts\n    file after it exists.\n\n  [ Sean
  Whitton ]\n  * Sbuild.keypairInsecurelyGenerated: Improved to be more robust.\n
  \ * Pass --allow-unrelated-histories to git merge when run with git 2.9 or\n    newer.
  This fixes the /usr/bin/propellor wrapper with this version of git.\n  * Sbuild.built
  & Sbuild.builtFor no longer require Sbuild.keypairGenerated.\n    Transition guide:
  If you are using sbuild 0.70.0 or newer, you should\n    `rm -r /var/lib/sbuild/apt-keys`.
  \ Otherwise, you should add either\n    Sbuild.keypairGenerated or Sbuild.keypairInsecurelyGenerated
  to your host.\n  * Sbuild haddock improvements:\n    - State that we don't support
  squeeze and Buntish older than trusty.\n      This is due to our enhancements, such
  as eatmydata.\n    - State that you need sbuild 0.70.0 or newer to build for stretch.\n
  \     This is due to gpg2 hitting Debian stretch.\n    - Explain when a keygen is
  required.\n    - Update sample ~/.sbuildrc for sbuild 0.71.0.\n    - Add hint for
  customising chroots with propellor.\n    - Update example usage of System type.\n\n

  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Haddock build fix.\n    Thanks, Sean Whitton\n\n
  -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Thu, 23 Jun 2016 08:12:57 -0400\n\npropellor (3.1.0)
  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Architecture changed from String to an ADT. (API
  Change)\n    Transition guide: Change \"amd64\" to X86_64, \"i386\" to X86_32,\n
  \   \"armel\" to ARMEL, etc.\n    Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * The Debian data type
  now includes a DebianKernel. (API Change)\n    This won't affect most config.hs,
  as osDebian defaults to\n    Linux. Added osDebian' can be used to specify a different
  kernel.\n    Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * Improve exception handling. A property that
  threw a non-IOException\n    used to stop the whole propellor run. Now, all non-async
  exceptions\n    only make the property that threw them fail. (Implicit API change)\n
  \ * Added StopPropellorException and stopPropellorMessage which can be\n    used
  in the unusual case where a failure of one property should stop\n    propellor from
  trying to ensure any other properties.\n  * tryPropellor returns Either SomeException
  instead of Either IOException\n    (API change)\n  * Switch letsencrypt to certbot
  package name.\n  * Sbuild: Add keyringInsecurelyGenerated which is useful on throwaway\n
  \   build VMs.\n    Thanks, Sean Whitton\n  * Added Propellor.Property.SiteSpecific.Exoscale.\n
  \   Thanks, Sean Whitton\n  * Property.Reboot: Added toDistroKernel and toKernelNewerThan.\n
  \   Thanks, Sean Whitton\n  * Added ConfFile.hasIniSection.\n    Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n
  \ * Apt.install: When asked to install a package that apt does not know\n    about,
  it used to incorrectly succeed. Now it will fail.\n  * Property.Firejail: New module.\n
  \   Thanks, Sean Whitton\n  * File: Write privdata files in binary rather than text,
  which avoids\n    failure when they do not contain valid unicode.\n    Thanks, Andrew
  Schurman\n  * Generalized fileProperty can now operate on a file as either a series\n
  \   of lines, or a ByteString.\n\n  [ Sean Whitton ]\n  * New info property Schroot.useOverlays
  to indicate whether you want schroots\n    set up by propellor to use the Linux
  kernel's OverlayFS.\n  * Schroot.overlaysInTmpfs sets Schroot.useOverlays info property.\n
  \ * If you have indicated that you want schroots to use OverlayFS and the\n    current
  kernel does not support it, Sbuild.built will attempt to reboot\n    into a kernel
  that does, or fail if it can't find one.\n  * Sbuild.built will no longer add duplicate
  `aliases=UNRELEASED,sid...` lines\n    to more than one schroot config. It will
  not remove any such lines that the\n    previous version of propellor added, though.\n
  \ * Sbuild.keypairGenerated works around Debian bug #792100 by creating the\n    directory
  /root/.gnupg in advance.\n  * Ccache.hasCache now sets the setgid bit on the cache
  directory, as \n    ccache requires.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Wed, 22 Jun
  2016 15:29:27 -0400\n\npropellor (3.0.5) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Modules
  added for Sbuild and Ccache.\n    Thanks, Sean Whitton\n  * Systemd: Added killUserProcesses
  property, which can be reverted\n    to return systemd to its default behavior before
  version 230 started\n    killing processes like screen sessions.\n  * Systemd: Added
  logindConfigured property.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Mon, 06 Jun 2016 17:13:21
  -0400\n\npropellor (3.0.4) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Run letsencrypt with
  --noninteractive.\n  * Fix build with ghc 8.0.1.\n    Thanks, davean.\n  * Module
  added for the Borg backup system.\n    Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * Fix build with
  directory-1.2.6.2.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sun, 22 May 2016 15:54:49 -0400\n\npropellor
  (3.0.3) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Remove Propellor.DotDir from the propellor
  library, as its use of\n    Paths_propellor prevents use of the module out of propellor's
  tree.\n    This module is only needed for the wrapper program anyway, which\n    handles
  --init.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sun, 01 May 2016 17:51:37 -0400\n\npropellor
  (3.0.2) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Added Apt.periodicUpdates.\n    Thanks,
  Félix Sipma.\n  * Apt.unattendedUpgrades: Enable mailing problem reports to root.\n
  \   Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * Added Propellor.Property.Fstab, and moved the fstabbed
  property to there.\n  * Attic module added for the backup system.\n    Thanks, Félix
  Sipma.\n  * Fix build with directory-1.2.6.2.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sat,
  30 Apr 2016 15:46:50 -0400\n\npropellor (3.0.1) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  *
  propellor --init now runs cabal sandbox init if cabal has been\n    configured with
  require-sandbox: True.\n    Thanks, Sean Whitton\n  * Re-bundled concurrent-output
  so propellor can be deployed to Debian\n    stable systems without installing it
  (insecurely) from hackage.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Tue, 05 Apr 2016 13:35:54
  -0400\n\npropellor (3.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Property types have been
  improved to indicate what systems they target.\n    This prevents using eg, Property
  FreeBSD on a Debian system.\n    Transition guide for this sweeping API change:\n
  \   - First, upgrade to propellor 2.17.2 and deploy that to all your hosts.\n      Otherwise,
  propellor --spin will fail when you upgrade to\n      propellor 3.0.0.\n    - Change
  \"host name & foo & bar\"\n      to     \"host name $ props & foo & bar\"\n    -
  Similarly, `propertyList` and `combineProperties` need `props`\n      to be used
  to combine together properties; they no longer accept\n      lists of properties.
  (If you have such a list, use `toProps`.)\n    - And similarly, Chroot, Docker,
  and Systemd container need `props`\n      to be used to combine together the properies
  used inside them.\n    - The `os` property is removed. Instead use `osDebian`, `osBuntish`,\n
  \     or `osFreeBSD`. These tell the type checker the target OS of a host.\n    -
  Change \"Property NoInfo\" to \"Property UnixLike\"\n    - Change \"Property HasInfo\"
  to \"Property (HasInfo + UnixLike)\"\n    - Change \"RevertableProperty NoInfo\"
  to\n      \"RevertableProperty UnixLike UnixLike\"\n    - Change \"RevertableProperty
  HasInfo\" to\n      \"RevertableProperty (HasInfo + UnixLike) UnixLike\"\n    -
  GHC needs {-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-} to use these fancy types.\n      This is
  enabled by default for all modules in propellor.cabal. But\n      if you are using
  propellor as a library, you may need to enable it\n      manually.\n    - If you
  know a property only works on a particular OS, like Debian\n      or FreeBSD, use
  that instead of \"UnixLike\". For example:\n      \"Property Debian\"\n    - It's
  also possible make a property support a set of OS's, for example:\n      \"Property
  (Debian + FreeBSD)\"\n    - Removed `infoProperty` and `simpleProperty` constructors,
  instead use\n      `property` to construct a Property.\n    - Due to the polymorphic
  type returned by `property`, additional type\n      signatures tend to be needed
  when using it. For example, this will\n      fail to type check, because the type
  checker cannot guess what type\n      you intend the intermediate property \"go\"
  to have:\n        foo :: Property UnixLike\n        foo = go `requires` bar\n \t
  \ where\n \t\tgo = property \"foo\" (return NoChange)\n      To fix, specify the
  type of go:\n \t  \tgo :: Property UnixLike\n    - `ensureProperty` now needs to
  be passed a witness to the type of the \n      property it's used in.\n      change
  this:  foo = property desc $ ... ensureProperty bar\n      to this:      foo = property'
  desc $ \\w -> ... ensureProperty w bar\n    - General purpose properties like cmdProperty
  have type \"Property UnixLike\".\n      When using that to run a command only available
  on Debian, you can\n      tighten the type to only the OS that your more specific
  property works on.\n      For example:\n        upgraded :: Property Debian\n        upgraded
  = tightenTargets (cmdProperty \"apt-get\" [\"upgrade\"])\n    - Several utility
  functions have been renamed:\n      getInfo to fromInfo\n      propertyInfo to getInfo\n
  \     propertyDesc to getDesc\n      propertyChildren to getChildren\n  * The new
  `pickOS` property combinator can be used to combine different\n    properties, supporting
  different OS's, into one Property that chooses\n    which to use based on the Host's
  OS.\n  * Re-enabled -O0 in propellor.cabal to reign in ghc's memory use handling\n
  \   these complex new types.\n  * Added dependency on concurrent-output; removed
  embedded copy.\n  * Apt.PPA: New module, contributed by Evan Cofsky.\n  * Improved
  propellor's first run experience; propellor --init will\n    walk the user through
  setting up ~/.propellor, with a choice between\n    a clone of propellor's git repository,
  or a minimal config, and will\n    configure propellor to use a gpg key.\n  * Stack
  support. \"git config propellor.buildsystem stack\" will make\n    propellor build
  its config using stack.\n  * When propellor is installed using stack, propellor
  --init will\n    automatically set propellor.buildsystem=stack.\n\n -- Joey Hess

  urgency=medium\n\n  * When new dependencies are added to propellor or the propellor
  config,\n    try harder to get them installed. In particular, this makes \n    propellor
  --spin work when the remote host needs to get dependencies\n    installed in order
  to build the updated config.\n  * Apt.update: Also run dpkg --configure -a here
  as apt for some reason\n    won't even update if dpkg was interrupted.\n\n -- Joey

  urgency=medium\n\n  * Avoid generating excessively long paths to the unix socket
  file\n    used for ssh connection caching. Mostly. Can still generate a too long\n
  \   one if $HOME is longer than 60 bytes.\n  * Uwsgi: add \".ini\" extension to
  app config files. \n    Files without extensions were ignored by uwsgi.\n    Thanks,

  (2.17.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Added initial support for FreeBSD.\n    Thanks,
  Evan Cofsky.\n  * Added Propellor.Property.ZFS.\n    Thanks, Evan Cofsky.\n  * Firewall:
  Reorganized Chain data type. (API change)\n    Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * Firewall:
  Separated Table and Target (API change)\n    Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * Ssh: change
  type of listenPort from Int to Port (API change)\n    Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  *
  Firewall: add TCPFlag, Frequency, TCPSyn, ICMPTypeMatch, NatDestination\n    Thanks,
  Félix Sipma.\n  * Network: Filter out characters not allowed in interfaces.d files.\n
  \   Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * Apt.upgrade: Run dpkg --configure -a first, to recover
  from\n    interrupted upgrades.\n  * Apt: Add safeupgrade.\n  * Force ssh, scp,
  and git commands to be run in the foreground.\n    Should fix intermittent hangs
  of propellor --spin.\n  * Avoid repeated re-building on systems such as FreeBSD
  where building\n    re-links the binary even when there are no changes.\n  * Locale.available:
  Run locale-gen, instead of dpkg-reconfigure locales,\n    which modified the locale.gen
  file and sometimes caused the property to\n    need to make changes every time.\n
  \ * Speed up propellor's build of itself, by asking cabal to only build\n    the
  propellor-config binary and not all the libraries.\n  * Tor.named: Fix bug that
  sometimes caused the property to fail the first\n    time, though retrying succeeded.\n\n

  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Obnam: Only let one backup job run at a time when
  a host has multiple\n    different backup properties, to avoid concurrent jobs fighting
  over\n    scarce resources (particularly memory). Other jobs block on a lock\n    file.\n
  \ * Removed references to a Debian derivative from code and documentation\n    because
  of an unfortunate trademark use policy.\n    http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/trademark_nonsense/\n
  \ * That included changing a data constructor to \"Buntish\", an API change.\n  *
  Firewall.rule: Now takes a Table parameter. (API change)\n  * Firewall: add InIFace/OutIFace
  Rules, add Source/Destination Rules,\n    add CustomTarget, and more improvements.\n
  \   Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * Ssh.authorizedKey: Fix bug preventing it from working
  when the\n    authorized_keys file does not yet exist.\n  * Removed Ssh.unauthorizedKey
  and made Ssh.authorizedKey revertable.\n    (API change)\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>
  \ Sat, 27 Feb 2016 13:31:57 -0400\n\npropellor (2.15.4) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * Build /usr/src/propellor/propellor.git reproducibly,\n    which makes the whole
  Debian package build reproducibly.\n    Thanks, Sean Whitton.\n  * Obnam: To cause
  old generations to be forgotten, keepParam can be\n    passed to a backup property;
  this causes obnam forget to be run.\n  * Delete /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades.ucf-dist
  when\n    unattended-upgrades is installed, to work around #812380 which results\n
  \   in many warnings from apt, including in cron mails.\n  * Added Propellor.Property.LetsEncrypt\n
  \ * Apache.httpsVirtualHost: New property, setting up a https vhost\n    with the

  and User.systemAccountFor' properties.\n    Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * Gpg.keyImported
  converted to not use a flag file and instead check\n    if gpg has the provided
  key already.\n    Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * Clean build with ghc 7.10.\n  * Merged
  Utility changes from git-annex.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sat, 19 Dec 2015
  16:43:09 -0400\n\npropellor (2.15.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Added UncheckedProperty
  type, along with unchecked to indicate a\n    Property needs its result checked,
  and checkResult and changesFile\n    to check for changes.\n  * Properties that
  run an arbitrary command, such as cmdProperty\n    and scriptProperty are converted
  to use UncheckedProperty, since\n    they cannot tell on their own if the command
  truely made a change or not.\n    (API Change)\n    Transition guide:\n    - When
  GHC complains about an UncheckedProperty, add:\n    \t`assume` MadeChange\n      (Since
  these properties used to always return MadeChange, that\n      change is always
  safe to make.)\n    - Or, if you know that the command should modifiy a file, use:\n
  \   \t`changesFile` filename\n  * The `trivial` combinator has been removed. (API
  change)\n    Instead, use:\n    \t`assume` NoChange\n    Or, better, use changesFile
  or checkResult to accurately report\n    when a property makes a change.\n  * A
  few properties have had their Result improved, for example\n    Apt.buldDep and
  Apt.autoRemove now check if a change was made or not.\n  * User.hasDesktopGroups

  (2.13.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * RevertableProperty used to be assumed to
  contain info, but this is\n    now made explicit, with RevertableProperty HasInfo
  or\n    RevertableProperty NoInfo. (API change)\n    Transition guide:\n      -
  If you define a RevertableProperty, expect some type check\n        failures like:
  \"Expecting one more argument to ‘RevertableProperty’\".\n      - Change it to \"RevertableProperty
  NoInfo\"\n      - The compiler will then tell you if it needs \"HasInfo\" instead.\n
  \     - If you have code that uses the RevertableProperty constructor\n        that
  fails to type check, use the more powerful <!> operator\n        instead to create
  the RevertableProperty.\n  * Various property combinators that combined a RevertableProperty\n
  \   with a non-revertable property used to yield a RevertableProperty.\n    This
  was a bug, because the combined property could not be fully\n    reverted in many
  cases, and the result is now a non-revertable property.\n  * combineWith now takes
  an additional parameter to control how revert\n    actions are combined (API change).\n
  \ * Added Propellor.Property.Concurrent for concurrent properties.\n  * Made the
  execProcess exported by propellor, and everything built on it,\n    avoid scrambled
  output when run concurrently.\n  * Propellor now depends on STM and text.\n  * The
  cabal file now builds propellor with -O. While -O0 makes ghc\n    take less memory
  while building propellor, it can lead to bad memory\n    usage at runtime due to
  eg, disabled stream fusion.\n  * Add File.isCopyOf. Thanks, Per Olofsson.\n\n --

  \   being now focused on only what's needed to write config.hs.\n    Use Propellor.Base
  to get all the things exported by Propellor before.\n    (API change)\n  * Some
  renaming of instance methods, and moving of functions to more\n    appropriate modules.
  (API change)\n  * Added File.isSymlinkedTo. Thanks, Per Olofsson.\n  * fileProperty,
  and properties derived from it now write the new\n    file content via origfile.propellor-new~,
  instead of to a randomly named\n    temp file. This allows them to clean up any
  temp file that may have\n    been left by an interrupted run of propellor.\n  *
  Added Propellor.Property.Spin, which can be used to make a host be a\n    controller
  of other hosts, which will automatically spin them each time\n    propellor is run.\n
  \ * Ssh.keyImported is replaced with Ssh.userKeys. (API change)\n    The new property
  only gets the private key from the privdata; the\n    public key is provided as
  a parameter, and so is available as\n    Info that other properties can use.\n  *
  Ssh.keyImported' is renamed to Ssh.userKeyAt, and also changed\n    to only import
  the private key from the privdata. (API change)\n  * While Ssh.keyImported and Ssh.keyImported'
  avoided updating existing\n    keys, the new Ssh.userKeys and Ssh.userKeyAt properties
  will\n    always update out of date key files.\n  * Ssh.pubKey renamed to Ssh.hostPubKey.

  now have the\n    name of the container as its context, rather than the name of\n
  \   the host(s) where the container is used. This allows eg, having different\n
  \   passwords for a user in different containers. Note that previously,\n    propellor
  would prompt using the container name as the context, but\n    not actually use
  privdata using that context; so this is a bug fix.\n  * Fix --add-key to not fail

  data types\n    private to a module. (API change)\n    Thanks to Joachim Breitner
  for the idea.\n  * Improve propellor wrapper to better handle installation cloning\n
  \   the public propellor repo, by setting that repo to be upstream,\n    so propellor
  doesnt try to push to a read-only repo.\n  * Added DebianMirror module, contributed

  for the caching DNS server.\n    Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * Added PTR to Dns.Record.
  While this is ignored by\n    Propellor.Property.Dns for now, since reverse DNS
  setup is not\n    implemented there yet, it can be used in other places, eg Unbound.\n
  \   Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * PrivData converted to newtype (API change).\n  * Stopped
  stripping trailing newlines when setting PrivData;\n    this was previously done
  to avoid mistakes when pasting eg passwords\n    with an unwanted newline. Instead,
  PrivData consumers should use either\n    privDataLines or privDataVal, to extract

  the Debian package, as I am retiring from Debian.\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>
  \ Sat, 08 Nov 2014 15:57:36 -0400\n\npropellor (0.9.1) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * Docker: Add ability to control when containers restart.\n  * Docker: Default
  to always restarting containers, so they come back \n    up after reboots and docker
  daemon upgrades. (API change)\n  * Fix loop when a docker host that does not exist
  was docked.\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Oct 2014 09:57:31 -0400\n\npropellor
  (0.9.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Avoid encoding the current stable suite
  in propellor's code,\n    since that poses a difficult transition around the release,\n
  \   and can easily be wrong if an older version of propellor is used.\n    Instead,
  the os property for a stable system includes the suite name\n    to use, eg Stable
  \"wheezy\".\n  * stdSourcesList uses the stable suite name, to avoid unwanted\n
  \   immediate upgrades to the next stable release. (API change)\n  * debCdn switched
  from cdn.debian.net to http.debian.net, which seems to be\n    better managed now.\n
  \ * Docker: Avoid committing container every time it's started up.\n\n -- Joey Hess
  <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 10 Oct 2014 11:37:45 -0400\n\npropellor (0.8.3) unstable;
  urgency=medium\n\n  * The Debian package now includes a single-revision git repository
  in\n    /usr/src/propellor/, and ~/.propellor/ is set up to use this repository
  as\n    its origin remote. This avoids relying on the security of the github\n    repository
  when using the Debian package.\n  * The /usr/bin/propellor wrapper will warn when
  ~/.propellor/ is out of date\n    and a newer version is available, after which
  git merge upstream/master\n    can be run to merge it.\n  * Included the config.hs
  symlink to config-simple.hs in the cabal and Debian\n    packages.\n\n -- Joey Hess
  <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 22 Aug 2014 13:02:01 -0400\n\npropellor (0.8.2) unstable;
  urgency=medium\n\n  * Fix bug in File.containsLines that caused lines that were
  already in the\n    file to sometimes be appended to the end.\n  * Hostname.sane
  also configures /etc/mailname.\n  * Fixed Postfix.satellite to really configure
  relayhost = smtp.domain.\n  * Avoid reconfiguring postfix unncessarily when it already
  has a relayhost.\n  * Deal with apache 2.4's change in the name of site-available
  config files.\n  * Hostname aliases can now be used in several places, including
  --spin\n    and Ssh.knownHost.\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 04 Aug
  2014 01:12:19 -0400\n\npropellor (0.8.1) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Run apt-get
  update in initial bootstrap.\n  * --list-fields now includes a table of fields that
  are not currently set,\n    but would be used if they got set.\n  * Remove .gitignore
  from cabal file list, to avoid build failure on Debian.\n    Closes: #754334\n\n
  -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 09 Jul 2014 22:11:31 -0400\n\npropellor (0.8.0)
  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Completely reworked privdata storage. There is now
  a single file,\n    and each host is sent only the privdata that its Properties
  actually use.\n\n    To transition existing privdata, run propellor against a host
  and\n    watch out for the red failure messages, and run the suggested commands\n
  \   to store the privdata using the new storage scheme. You may find\n    it useful
  to run the old version of propellor to extract data from the old\n    privdata files
  during this migration.\n\n    Several properties that use privdata now require a
  context to be\n    specified. If in doubt, you can use anyContext, or\n    Context
  \"hostname.example.com\"\n\n  * Add --edit to edit a privdata value in $EDITOR.\n
  \ * Add --list-fields to list all currently set privdata fields, along with\n    the
  hosts that use them.\n  * Fix randomHostKeys property to run openssh-server's postinst
  in a\n    non-failing way.\n  * Hostname.sane now cleans up the 127.0.0.1 localhost
  line in /etc/hosts,\n    to avoid eg, apache complaining \"Could not reliably determine
  the\n    server's fully qualified domain name\".\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>
  \ Sun, 06 Jul 2014 18:28:08 -0400\n\npropellor (0.7.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * combineProperties no longer stops when a property fails; now it continues\n
  \   trying to satisfy all properties on the list before propigating the\n    failure.\n
  \ * Attr is renamed to Info. (API change)\n  * Renamed wrapper to propellor to make
  cabal installation of propellor work.\n  * When git gpg signature of a fetched git
  branch cannot be verified,\n    propellor will now continue running, but without
  merging in that branch.\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 13 Jun 2014 10:06:40
  -0400\n\npropellor (0.6.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Docker containers now
  propagate DNS attributes out to the host they're\n    docked in. So if a docker
  container sets a DNS alias, every container\n    it's docked in will automatically
  be added to a DNS round-robin,\n    when propellor is used to manage DNS for the
  domain.\n  * Apt.stdSourcesList no longer needs a suite to be specified. (API change)\n
  \ * Added --dump to dump out a field of a host's privdata. Useful for editing\n
  \   it.\n  * Propellor's output now includes the hostname being provisioned, or\n
  \   when provisioning a docker container, the container name.\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>
  \ Thu, 05 Jun 2014 17:32:14 -0400\n\npropellor (0.5.3) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * Fix unattended-upgrades config for !stable.\n  * Ensure that kernel hostname
  is same as /etc/hostname when configuring\n    hostname.\n  * Added modules for
  some hosting providers (DigitalOcean, CloudAtCost).\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>
  \ Thu, 29 May 2014 14:29:53 -0400\n\npropellor (0.5.2) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * A bug that caused propellor to hang when updating a running docker\n    container
  appears to have been fixed. Note that since it affects\n    the propellor process
  that serves as \"init\" of docker containers,\n    they have to be restarted for
  the fix to take effect.\n  * Licence changed from GPL to BSD.\n  * A few changes
  to allow building Propellor on OSX. One user reports\n    successfully using it
  there.\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 17 May 2014 16:42:55 -0400\n\npropellor
  (0.5.1) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Primary DNS servers now have allow-transfer
  automatically populated\n    with the IP addresses of secondary dns servers. So,
  it's important\n    that all secondary DNS servers have an ipv4 (and/or ipv6) property\n
  \   configured.\n  * Deal with old ssh connection caching sockets.\n  * Add missing
  build deps and deps. Closes: #745459\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 24
  Apr 2014 18:09:58 -0400\n\npropellor (0.5.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Removed
  root domain records from SOA. Instead, use RootDomain\n    when calling Dns.primary.
  (API change)\n  * Dns primary and secondary properties are now revertable.\n  *
  When unattendedUpgrades is enabled on an Unstable or Testing system,\n    configure
  it to allow the upgrades.\n  * New website, https://propellor.branchable.com/\n\n
  -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Apr 2014 17:38:02 -0400\n\npropellor (0.4.0)
  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Propellor can configure primary DNS servers, including
  generating\n    zone files, which is done by looking at the properties of hosts\n
  \   in a domain.\n  * The `cname` property was renamed to `alias` as it does not
  always\n    generate CNAME in the DNS. (API change)\n  * Constructor of Property
  has changed (use `property` function instead).\n    (API change)\n  * All Property
  combinators now combine together their Attr settings.\n    So Attr settings can
  be made inside a propertyList, for example.\n  * Run all cron jobs under chronic
  from moreutils to avoid unnecessary\n    mails.\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>
  \ Sat, 19 Apr 2014 02:09:56 -0400\n\npropellor (0.3.1) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * Merge scheduler bug fix from git-annex.\n  * Support for provisioning hosts
  with ssh and gpg keys.\n  * Obnam support.\n  * Apache support.\n  * Postfix satellite
  system support.\n  * Properties can now be satisfied differently on different operating\n
  \   systems.\n  * Standard apt configuration for stable now includes backports.\n
  \ * Cron jobs generated by propellor use flock(1) to avoid multiple\n    instances
  running at a time.\n  * Add support for SSH ed25519 keys.\n    (Thanks, Franz Pletz.)\n\n
  -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 17 Apr 2014 20:07:33 -0400\n\npropellor (0.3.0)
  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * ipv6to4: Ensure interface is brought up automatically
  on boot.\n  * Enabling unattended upgrades now ensures that cron is installed and\n
  \   running to perform them.\n  * Properties can be scheduled to only be checked
  after a given time period.\n  * Fix bootstrapping of dependencies.\n  * Fix compilation
  on Debian stable.\n  * Include security updates in sources.list for stable and testing.\n
  \ * Use ssh connection caching, especially when bootstrapping.\n  * Properties now
  run in a Propellor monad, which provides access to\n    attributes of the host.
  (API change)\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 11 Apr 2014 01:19:05 -0400\n\npropellor
  (0.2.3) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * docker: Fix laziness bug that caused running
  containers to be\n    unnecessarily stopped and committed.\n  * Add locking so only
  one propellor can run at a time on a host.\n  * docker: When running as effective
  init inside container, wait on zombies.\n  * docker: Added support for configuring
  shared volumes and linked\n    containers.\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue,
  08 Apr 2014 02:07:37 -0400\n\npropellor (0.2.2) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  *
  Now supports provisioning docker containers with architecture/libraries\n    that
  do not match the host.\n  * Fixed a bug that caused file modes to be set to 600
  when propellor\n    modified the file (did not affect newly created files).\n\n
  -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 04 Apr 2014 01:07:32 -0400\n\npropellor (0.2.1)
  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * First release with Debian package.\n\n -- Joey Hess
  <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 03 Apr 2014 01:43:14 -0400\n\npropellor (0.2.0) unstable;
  urgency=low\n\n  * Added support for provisioning Docker containers.\n  * Bootstrap
  deployment now pushes the git repo to the remote host\n    over ssh, securely.\n
  \ * propellor --add-key configures a gpg key, and makes propellor refuse\n    to
  pull commits from git repositories not signed with that key.\n    This allows propellor
  to be securely used with public, non-encrypted\n    git repositories without the
  possibility of MITM.\n  * Added support for type-safe reversions. Only some properties
  can be\n    reverted; the type checker will tell you if you try something that won't\n
  \   work.\n  * New syntactic sugar for building a list of properties, including\n
  \   revertable properties.\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 02 Apr 2014

description: ! "[Propellor](https://propellor.branchable.com/) is a\nconfiguration
  management system using Haskell and Git.\nEach system has a list of properties,
  which Propellor ensures\nare satisfied.\n[Linux](http://propellor.branchable.com/Linux/)
  and\n[FreeBSD](http://propellor.branchable.com/FreeBSD/) are supported.\n\nPropellor
  is configured via a git repository, which typically lives\nin `~/.propellor/` on
  your development machine. Propellor clones the\nrepository to each host it manages,
  in a \n[secure](http://propellor.branchable.com/security/) way. See \n[components](http://propellor.branchable.com/components/)\nfor
  details.\n\nProperties are defined using Haskell. Edit `~/.propellor/config.hs`\nto
  get started. There is fairly complete \n[API documentation](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/),\nwhich
  includes many built-in Properties for dealing with\n[Apt](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/docs/Propellor-Property-Apt.html)\nand\n[Apache](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/docs/Propellor-Property-Apache.html)\n,\n[Cron](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/docs/Propellor-Property-Cron.html)\nand\n[Commands](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/docs/Propellor-Property-Cmd.html)\n,\n[Dns](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/docs/Propellor-Property-Dns.html)\nand\n[Docker](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/docs/Propellor-Property-Docker.html),
  etc.\n\nThere is no special language as used in puppet, chef, ansible, etc.. just\nthe
  full power of Haskell. Hopefully that power can be put to good use in\nmaking declarative
  properties that are powerful, nicely idempotent, and\neasy to adapt to a system's
  special needs!\n\nIf using Haskell to configure Propellor seems intimidating,\nsee
  [configuration for the Haskell newbie](https://propellor.branchable.com/haskell_newbie/).\n\n##
  quick start\n\n1. Get propellor installed on your development machine (ie, laptop).\n
  \    `cabal install propellor`\n          or\n     `apt-get install propellor`\n2.
  Run `propellor --init` ; this will set up a `~/.propellor/` git\n   repository for
  you.\n3. Edit `~/.propellor/config.hs`, and add a host you want to manage.\n   You
  can start by not adding any properties, or only a few.\n4. Run: `propellor --spin
  $HOST`\n5. Now you have a simple propellor deployment to a host. Continue editing\n
  \  `~/.propellor/config.hs` to further configure the host, add more hosts\n   etc,
  and re-run `propellor --spin $HOST` after each change.  \n6. Once you have a lot
  of hosts, and running `propellor --spin HOST` for\n   each host becomes tiresome,
  you can\n   [automate that](http://propellor.branchable.com/automated_spins/).\n7.
  Write some neat new properties and send patches!\n"
