description: |-
  The library implements the Processing language (see <https://processing.org/>). It's an imperative EDSL for graphics and animation.
  It's very easy and fun to use. There are many books on processing and community is fairly active.
  We can find the quick start guide and lots of examples in the project repository
  on github <https://github.com/anton-k/processing-for-haskell> (see the directory @examples@).
  There is a tutorial at the project homepage at github: <https://github.com/anton-k/processing-for-haskell>.
