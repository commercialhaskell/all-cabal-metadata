  Google Protocol Buffers via GHC.Generics.

  Protocol Buffers are a way of encoding structured data in an efficient yet extensible format.
  Google uses Protocol Buffers for almost all of its internal RPC protocols and file formats.

  This library supports a useful subset of Google Protocol Buffers message specifications
  in a Haskell. No preprocessor or additional build steps are required for message encoding and decoding.

  Record specifications are built by defining records with specially defined fields that
  capture most of the Protocol Buffers specification language.
