changelog: "# Changelog for [`process` package](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/process)\n\n##
  1.6.6.0 *October 2019*\n\n* Fix a potential privilege escalation issue (or, more
  precisely, privileges\n  not being dropped when this was the user's intent) where
  the groups of the\n  spawning process's user would be incorrectly retained due to
  a missing call to\n  `initgroups` [#149].\n* Bug fix: Prevent stripping undecodable
  bytes from environment variables\n  when in a non-unicode locale.\n  [#152](https://github.com/haskell/process/issues/152)\n*

  This package contains libraries for dealing with system processes.

  The typed-process package is a more recent take on a process API,
  which uses this package internally. It features better binary
  support, easier concurrency, and a more composable API. You can
  read more about it at
  <https://github.com/fpco/typed-process/#readme>.
