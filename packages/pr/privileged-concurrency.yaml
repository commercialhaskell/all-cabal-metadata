synopsis: Provides privilege separated versions of the concurrency primitives.
changelog: ! "0.7.0\n-----\n\n* Added `Control.Concurrent...Class` modules with typeclasses
  for overloaded\n  operations. Functions like `putMVar` now work on both `WriteOnlyMVar`
  and\n  `MVar`.\n\n* Export list updated. Importing `Control.Concurrent.Privilege`
  should now be\n  enough for all use cases.\n\n0.6.2\n-----\n\n* Added `tryReadTChan`,
  `peekTChan` and `tryPeekTChan` for read-only `TChan`s.\n\n0.6.1\n-----\n\n* Added
  `tryReadMVar` for read-only `MVar`s.\n\n0.6\n---\n\n* Write-only types are no longer
  `Eq`, but are now contravariant functors.\n\n0.5\n---\n\n* Read-only types are no
  longer `Eq`, but are now functors.\n\n0.4\n---\n\n* Functions are low lifted to
  `MonadBase IO`.\n\n0.3\n---\n\n* Initial version with read-only and write-only versions
  of `Chan`, `MVar`,\n  `TChan`, `TMVar` and `TVar`.\n"

description: ! 'Any @MVar@ or other concurrency primitive can be read by or written
  to any

  function which recieves it as a value. This package provides read-only and

  write-only versions of @Chan@, @MVar@, @TChan@, @TMVar@, and @TVar@.

  Functions which use these versions receive permission to read, write, or

  both based on their type signatures.'
