  This package provides a "Prelude" module drop-in replacement for [base](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base)'s @Prelude@ module.

  Goals of this package include:

  * Be reasonably modest and remain close in spirit to the @base@ package's scope

  * Depend only on @base@ (via @base-noprelude@) for recent GHC versions

  * Avoid partial functions being in scope by default; redefine common partial functions such as @read@ or @head@ to be 'Maybe'-valued

  * Provide a uniform "Prelude" across multiple GHC releases (currently GHC 7.0 and newer supported) to the extent possible given typeclass restructurings such as AMP or FTP

  * Reduce @import@ clutter by reexporting common verbs from modules such as @Control.Monad@ and @Control.Applicative@

  === Versioning and Usage

  This package is intended to be used in combination with [base-noprelude](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-noprelude) and
  possibly [base-orphans](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-orphans). @Prelude@ strives to be faithful to
  the [PVP](https://pvp.haskell.org/); however, for technical reasons @Prelude@'s API is not fully determined by its version due to changes in core typeclasses and consequently it's strongly advised to declare a dependency on @Prelude@ always in conjunction with a dependency on @base-noprelude@.

  For instance, all you need to do in order to use this package if you were previously depending on [base](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base) via

  > build-depends:
  >     base (>= 4.3.0.0 && < 4.11) || ^>= 4.11.0.0

  is to replace @base@ by @base-noprelude@ and also add a dependency on @Prelude@ like so

  > build-depends:
  >     Prelude ^>= 0.1.0.0
  >   , base-noprelude (>= 4.3.0.0 && < 4.11) || ^>= 4.11.0.0

  and this will effectively replace the implicit "Prelude" module.

  Alternatively, if you only intend to support GHC 7.10 and newer, you can make use @mixins@ like so

  > build-depends:
  >     Prelude ^>= 0.1.0.0
  >   , base (>= 4.8.0.0 && < 4.12) || ^>= 4.12.0.0
  >
  > mixins: base hiding (Prelude)
