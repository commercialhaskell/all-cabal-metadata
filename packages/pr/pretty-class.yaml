description: |-
  Pretty printing class similar to Show, based on the HughesPJ
  pretty printing library.  Provides the pretty printing class
  and instances for the Prelude types.  This upload replaces the
  old pretty-class package (which I believe nobody is using) with
  a copy of Lennart's prettyclass package with a small change to
  its Char instance.
