  Features

  [No more 'String']
  'String' is removed in favor of lazy 'Data.Text.Lazy.Text'.

  [No more 'Num']
  The 'Num' typeclass is now just for types which can be converted from
  integer literals.

  ['Semigroup's]
  'Semigroup's are now in scope by default, as well as some useful
  wrappers.

  ['Semiring's]
  A 'Semiring' has the operations '+' and '*', and the members 'one'
  and 'zero'. 'Bool' is a 'Semiring', as is 'Integer', etc. 'Num' is
  /not/ a superclass of 'Semiring'.

  [Sensibly strict]
  Several functions, such as 'foldl', 'sum', 'product', etc. are strict
  as default.

  [No unnecessary 'Monad's]
  Functions such as 'Control.Monad.sequence', 'Control.Monad.>>', and
  'Control.Monad.replicateM' are removed in favor of the equivalent
  'sequenceA', '*>', and 'replicateA' on 'Applicative's.

  [Fewer partial functions]
  Functions like 'head', 'last', 'minimum', etc. now return 'Nothing'
  when called on empty structures. 'tail' and 'init' return empty
  lists when called on empty lists.

  [Data structures]
  'Map' and 'Set' (the strict variants) are now in scope by default,
  with a minimal, non-colliding aliased api.

  [Transformers]
  'State' is now in scope by default.

  [Debugging]
  Handy functions like 'trace', 'traceShow', and 'notImplemented' are
  in scope by default. They give warnings when used so they can't be
  forgotten.

  [Other handy functions]
  An /O(n*log n)/ 'nub', 'foldr2', 'converge', 'bool', and others.
