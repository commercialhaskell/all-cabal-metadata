  # Revision history for predicate-transformers

  ## 0.17.0.0 -- 2024-10-13
  * Rename multiple functions to shorter names with the intent that predicate-transformers be imported qualified.
    In particular `also` renamed to `and`, `otherHand` renamed to `or`, etc.
  * Delete `lens` and `mtl` dependencies.
  * Delete `soleElementOf`, for lack of use in favor of `match`.
  * Rename `Predicatory` to `Boolish` for ease of reading.
  * Delete `Exceptional` class, folding it into the newly renamed `Boolish`.
  * Delete `predJust`, `predLeft`, and `predRight` in favor of `match` uses.

  ## 0.16.0.0 -- 2024-10-13
  * Add predicate failure error messages that include the actual value under test and a message explaining what was expected.
  * Rename `just`, `left`, and `right` to `predJust`, `predLeft`, `predRight`

  ## 0.15.0.0 -- 2024-08-23
  * Change `?` to right associative so that it works with `.`.

  ## 0.14.0.0 -- 2024-08-23
  * Add `?` back in as a useful operator to work with `&`; `&` can be used as a predicate applicator, and `?` can be used as a predicate transformer applicator, allowing for a form of infix binary application like `x & f ? y = f x y`.
  * Add `match` back in as a type-restricted alias for `soleElementOf`.

  ## 0.13.0.0 -- 2024-07-23
  * Remove `?`

  ## 0.12.0.0 -- 2024-07-23
  * Rename `sole` to `soleElement`
  * Add `?`, an infix function application operator with lower
    precedence than `!`.
  * Add `satAll = foldr also continue`.

  ## 0.11.0.0 -- 2024-07-21
  * Add documentation.
  * Rename `onlyContains` to `sole`. Add `soleOf`, generalizing over `Fold`s.
    `soleOf` is likely a better replacement for `match` than `allOf1` was.
  * Exchange `INLINABLE` pragmas for `-fexpose-all-unfoldings`.
  * Implement `traceFailFunShow`.
  * Change `Exceptional`'s method `assess` to make it possible to implement for functional predicates, and delete `traceFailFun`, now redundant.

  ## 0.10.0.0 -- 2024-07-21

  * Rename `oneOfTwo` to `otherHand`, for easier reading.
  * Set `also` and `otherHand` precedences to those of `&&` and `||`
    respectively. That makes them work better with the precedence of
    `!`, allowing easier composition.
  * Rename `only` to `onlyContains`, for easier reading and to avoid a
    name conflict with `Control.Lens.only`.
  * Set `!` precedence to be equal to that of `.`.
  * Add `equals` predicate.
  * Delete `match`. `allOf1` does the same thing more generally, with
    `Fold` instead of `Prism`.
  * Make `otherHand` stop catching async exceptions. Otherwise a thread
    being killed may appear as a predicate failure.

  ## 0.9.0.0 -- 2024-07-21

  * Add instance `Predicatory (e -> a)`. This will allow for adding extra
    parameters to predicates, making it easier to compose them; maybe
    these are called "functional predicates".
  * Added `traceFailFun`. This version of traceFail works on functional
    predicates.
  * Tupling sugar renamed from `==>` to `:=>`, to allow it to be a pattern synonym.
  * Minor code style changes.

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2019-10-05

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.
