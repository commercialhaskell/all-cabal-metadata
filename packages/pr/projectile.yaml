  ## Raison d'etre

  Inspired by [bbatsov's](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile) work, this library was created with
  the purpose of reliably access to _project_ resources in a somewhat unified way when developing CLI
  tools or [Turtle](https://github.com/Gabriel439/Haskell-Turtle-Library) scripts.

  ## Development
  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/roman/Haskell-projectile}.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/roman/Haskell-projectile)
