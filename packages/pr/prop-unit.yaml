  Conveniences for using Hedgehog as a unit test runner

  It's a pain to share assertions between Hedgehog and HUnit. My solution is to basically turn unit tests into really simple property-based tests!

  Useful environment variables:

      # Turn on "debug mode" (default 0)
      # Changes buffering and threading for easier debugging
      PROP_UNIT_DEBUG=1

      # Increase test examples (default 100)
      # Only has effect on true property-based tests
      PROP_UNIT_LIMIT=1000
