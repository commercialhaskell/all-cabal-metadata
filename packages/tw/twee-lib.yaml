description: |-
  Twee is an experimental equational theorem prover based on
  Knuth-Bendix completion.

  Given a set of equational axioms and a set of equational
  conjectures it will try to prove the conjectures.
  It will terminate if the conjectures are true but normally
  fail to terminate if they are false.

  The input problem should be in TPTP format (see
  http://www.tptp.org). You can use types and quantifiers, but apart
  from that the problem must be equational.

  This package contains only the library part of twee.
