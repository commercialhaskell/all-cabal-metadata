  Oleg Kiselyov's three new monad transformers for multi-prompt delimited control
  (released with his permission)

  This library implements the superset of the interface described in
  *   /A Monadic Framework for Delimited Continuations/,
  R. Kent Dybvig, Simon Peyton Jones, and Amr Sabry
  JFP, v17, N6, pp. 687--730, 2007.
  <http://www.cs.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/techreports/TRNNN.cgi?trnum=TR615>

  This library's "Control.Monad.CC.CCCxe" is derived as a CPS version of
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/CC-delcont-exc>'s Control.Monad.CC.CCExc.
  "Control.Monad.CC.CCCxe" is sometimes more efficient; it is always less perspicuous.
  Both libraries provide the identical interface and are interchangeable. It seems
  that CC-delcont-exc's  Control.Monad.CC.CCExc is faster at delimited control but
  imposes more overhead on the conventional code; "Control.Monad.CC.CCCxe" is dual.
  It pays to use "Control.Monad.CC.CCCxe" in code with long stretches of determinism
  punctuated by fits and restarts.

  See the original article at <http://okmij.org/ftp/continuations/implementations.html#CC-monads>
  for more information.

  This package split multi-prompt delimited control from
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/liboleg> for usability.
