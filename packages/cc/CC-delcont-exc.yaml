  This library implements the superset of the interface described in
  *   /A Monadic Framework for Delimited Continuations/,
  R. Kent Dybvig, Simon Peyton Jones, and Amr Sabry
  JFP, v17, N6, pp. 687--730, 2007.

  This library is the most direct implementation of the bubble-up reduction
  semantics of multi-prompt delimited control. The library stands out in not
  being based on the continuation monad. Rather, the monad of "Control.Monad.CC.CCExc"
  is an extension of the 'Error' monad: a monad for restartable exceptions.
  The library offers not one monad transformer but a family ('CC' 'p')
  parameterized by the prompt flavor 'p' . The library defines several prompt
  flavors; the users are welcome to define their own.

  See the original article at <http://okmij.org/ftp/continuations/implementations.html#CC-monads>
  for more information.

  This package split multi-prompt delimited control from
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/liboleg> for usability.
