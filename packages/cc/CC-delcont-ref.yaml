  This library implements the superset of the interface described in
  *   /A Monadic Framework for Delimited Continuations/,
  R. Kent Dybvig, Simon Peyton Jones, and Amr Sabry
  JFP, v17, N6, pp. 687--730, 2007.
  <http://www.cs.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/techreports/TRNNN.cgi?trnum=TR615>

  This library is closest to the interface of Dybvig, Peyton Jones and Sabry.
  "Control.Monad.CC.CCRef" is derived from the definitional interpreter using
  the implementation techniques described and justified in the FLOPS 2010 paper.
  The monad transformer 'CC' implemented by "Control.Monad.CC.CCRef" requires
  the base monad to support reference cells. In other words, the base monad
  must be a member of the type class 'Mutable': that is, must be 'IO', 'ST',
  'STM' or their transformer. "Control.Monad.CC.CCRef" adds to the original
  interface the frequently used function 'abortP' as a primitive.

  See the original article at <http://okmij.org/ftp/continuations/implementations.html#CC-monads>
  for more information.

  This package split multi-prompt delimited control from
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/liboleg> for usability.
