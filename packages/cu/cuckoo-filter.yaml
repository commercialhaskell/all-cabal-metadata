  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ChrisCoffey/cuckoo-filter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ChrisCoffey/cuckoo-filter)


  Cuckoo filters are a probabilistic data structure used to answer questions like
  "Have I already seen this user" or "Is this word in the English language?". They''re
  _probabilistic_ because each membership operation has a false positive probability.
  It guarnatees that there will never be a false negative, but may have a low chance
  of false positives.


  Bloom filters are the cannonical probabilistic filter structure, and cuckoo filters
  are a simlar but different tool. As a bloom filter''s load factor increases, the
  chance of false positive trends towards 100%, but the inserts will never fail. On
  the other hand, a Cuckoo filter retains a relatively stable false positive probability
  under load, but as load approahes 95% inserts will begin to fail. In either case
  you probably want to resize your filter...


  This implementation has the following properties:

  - Buckets of 4 elements

  - 8 bit fingerprints

  - Cycle termination during item kicking occurs after (0.1 * size) buckets have been
  checked.

  - Size may be any non-zero natural number (not limited to powers of 2)


  For more details about how Cuckoo filters work, I recommend you read Fan et. al.''s
  2016 paper https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/papers/cuckoo-conext2014.pdf.


  ### Usage

  Cuckoo filters support three operations: `insert`, `member`, and `delete`. See the
  [haddocks]() for details.


  ### Performance

  As you''ll find in the criterion results, the pure version of the filter can handle
  ~1.6 million insertions/s. From memory profiles, the vast majority of the memory
  is taken up by the underlying implementation of `Filter`, so this is an obvious
  area for improvement.


  The current implementation avoids pre-allocating memory for the filter, so the heap
  usage will incrase linearly with `insert` calls. This obviously helps keep heap
  usage low for sparse filters, but also means inserts are slower than they would
  be in a mutable implementation.


  ### TODO

  - [ ] Benchmark against a Bloom filter implementation

  - [ ] Introduce a mutable version of `Filter` and a typeclass for the storage interactions
