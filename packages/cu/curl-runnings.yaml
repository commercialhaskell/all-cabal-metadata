description: "# curl-runnings\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aviaviavi/curl-runnings.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aviaviavi/curl-runnings)
  \n[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/curl-runnings.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/curl-runnings)\n\n_Feel
  the rhythm! Feel the rhyme! Get on up, it's testing time! curl-runnings!_\n\nA common
  form of black-box API testing boils down to simply making requests to\nan endpoint
  and verifying properties of the response. curl-runnings aims to make\nwriting tests
  like this fast and easy.\n\ncurl-runnings is a framework for writing declarative
  tests for your APIs in a\nfashion equivalent to performing `curl`s and verifying
  the responses. Write your\ntests quickly and correctly with a straight-forward specification
  in\n[Dhall](https://dhall-lang.org/), yaml, or json that can encode simple but\npowerful
  matchers against responses.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the curl-runnings library
  to write your tests in\nHaskell (though a Haskell setup is absolutely not required
  to use this tool).\n\n\n### Installing\n\nBinaries are available on the Releases
  section of the GitHub page.\n\nYou can also compile from source with stack.\n\n###
  Writing a test specification\n\nCurl runnings tests are just data! A test spec is
  an object containing an array\nof `cases`, where each item represents a single curl
  and set of assertions about\nthe response. Write your tests specs in a Dhall, yaml
  or json file. Note: the legacy\nformat of a top level array of test cases is still
  supported, but may not be in\nfuture releases.\n\n```dhall\nlet JSON = https://prelude.dhall-lang.org/JSON/package.dhall\n\nlet
  CurlRunnings = ./dhall/curl-runnings.dhall\n\nin   CurlRunnings.hydrateCase\n        CurlRunnings.Case::{\n
  \       , expectData = Some\n            ( CurlRunnings.ExpectData.Exactly\n                (
  JSON.object\n                    [ { mapKey = \"okay\", mapValue = JSON.bool True
  },\n                      { mapKey = \"message\", mapValue = JSON.string \"a message\"
  }]\n                )\n            )\n        , expectStatus = 200\n        , name
  = \"test 1\"\n        , requestMethod = CurlRunnings.HttpMethod.GET\n        , url
  = \"http://your-endpoing.com/status\"\n        }\n```\n\n\n```yaml\n---\n# example-test.yaml\n#\n#
  specify all your test cases as an array keys on `cases`\ncases:\n  - name: A curl
  runnings test case\n    url: http://your-endpoint.com/status\n    requestMethod:
  GET\n    # Specify the json payload we expect here\n    expectData:\n      # The
  1 key in this object specifies the matcher we want\n      # to use to test the returned
  payload. In this case, we\n      # require the payload is exactly what we specify.\n
  \     exactly:\n        okay: true\n        msg: 'a message'\n    # Assertions about
  the returned status code. Pass in\n    # an acceptable code or list of codes\n    expectStatus:
  200\n\n```\n\nSee /examples for more example curl runnings specifications, which
  walk\nthrough some of the other features that can be encoded in your tests such
  as:\n- reference data from previous responses of previous test cases\n- reference
  environment variables\n- various easy-to-use json matchers\n- support for importing
  data from other yaml files in your spec\n\n### Running\n\nOnce you've written a
  spec, simply run it with:\n\n```curl-runnings -f path/to/your/spec.yaml ```\n\n(hint:
  try using the --verbose flag for more output)\n\nIf all your tests pass, curl-runnings
  will cleanly exit with a 0 code. A code of\n1 will be returned if any tests failed.\n\nYou
  can also select specific test cases by filtering via regex by using the\n`--grep`
  flag. Just make sure your case isn't referencing data from previous\nexamples that
  won't get run!\n\nFor more info:\n\n```curl-runnings --help ```\n\n\n### Running
  With Docker\nA dockerfile is included in the root of the project. The Dockerfile
  will expect the linux based curl-runnings executable in the same directory as the
  Dockerfile and a `tests.yml` file. You can download the latest executable from the
  release page : https://github.com/aviaviavi/curl-runnings/releases .\n\n``` docker
  build . -t curl-runnings-tests```\n\n```  docker run curl-runnings-tests```\n\nIf
  you use docker-compose, you can add this to docker-compose.yml:\n\n```\ntests:\n
  \   build:\n      context: .\n      dockerfile: ./Dockerfile\n```\n\n### Contributing\n\nContributions
  in any form are welcome and encouraged. Don't be shy! :D\n\n"
