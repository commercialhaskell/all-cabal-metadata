changelog: "# Changelog for `cuddle`\n\n## 1.1.2.0\n\n* Export `Type0`\n\n## 1.1.1.0\n\n*
  Removed traces from `Codec.CBOR.Cuddle.CBOR.Validator`\n* Add `isCBORTermResultValid`\n*
  Add `Eq` instance to `XTerm ValidatorStage`, `XXCTree ValidatorStage` and `CBORTermResult`\n\n##
  1.1.0.0\n\n* Change the type of field of `T2Group` to `GroupDef`\n* Remove `Named`
  from exports\n* Changed `T2Ref` to take a `Rule` instead of `Named Type0`\n* Add
  `GroupDef`, `HIGroup` constructor now expects a `GroupDef` instead of `Named Group`\n*
  Changed the following type synonyms to proper datatypes:\n  - `GRuleDef` \n  - `GRuleCall`\n*
  Removed `Codec.CBOR.Cuddle.Huddle.Optics`\n* Changed the `comment` to take a `Comment`
  argument instead of `Text`\n* Changed the following functions to take a `Name` instead
  of `Text`:\n  - `(=:=)`\n  - `(=:~)`\n  - `(=::=)`\n  - `unsafeIncludeFromHuddle`\n*
  Changed the type of `name` field in `Named` to `Name`\n* Remove the description
  field from `Named`\n* Renamed the `name` field to `unName` in `Name`\n* Add `HasName`\n*
  Add `bool` to `Huddle` module\n* Removed most `Show` instances from `Huddle` as
  they were unlawful\n* Added `ctrTerm` and `ctrResult` field accessors to `CBORTermResult`\n*
  Add `ValidatorStage`\n* Remove `validateCBOR'`, copied its implementation to `validateCBOR`\n*
  Add extra information field to `UnapplicableRule`\n* Implement `IndexMappable` instance
  for\n  - `HuddleStage` to `CTreePhase`\n  - `HuddleStage` to `PrettyStage`\n* Change
  the order of fields in `GroupEntry`; the extension field is now the last field\n*
  Add `IndexMappable` to help with traversing `CDDL` trees\n* Add an index type parameter
  to all `CDDL` terms\n* Remove `Codec.CBOR.Cuddle.CDDL.Prelude`\n* Replace `cddlPrelude`
  with `cddlPostlude`, `prependPrelude` with `appendPostlude`\n* Move `PTerm` to `Codec.CBOR.Cuddle.CDDL.CTree`\n*
  Remove `CTreeRoot'`\n* Changed the type in `CTreeRoot` to a map of resolved `CTree`s\n*
  Changed the type of the first argument for `generateCBORTerm` and \n  `generateCBORTerm'`
  to `CTreeRoot`\n* Removed all exports in `Codec.CBOR.Cuddle.CBOR.Validator` except
  for \n  `validateCBOR`, `validateCBOR'`, `CBORTermResult` and `CDDLResult`\n\n##
  1.0.0.0\n\n* First official release to Hackage\n* Added one more parameter to `BindingEnv`\n\n##
  0.5.0.0\n\n* Implement a validator for CBOR terms.\n\n## 0.4.0.0\n\n* Rewrote the
  prettyprinter to make the output more human-readable.\n* Added `collectFromInit`
  to make it possible to specify the order of\n  definitions manually. `collectFrom`
  and `collectFromInit` now expect\n  `HuddleItem`s in their arguments\n* More Huddle
  terms now accept comments (e.g. `ArrayEntry`, `ArrayChoice`)\n* Parser now preserves
  most comments.\n\n## 0.3.6.0\n\n* Support having keys in group entries. This is
  needed when using a group to\n  define a map, or when wishing to include keys in
  for-use-in-array groups for\n  documentation purposes. This may introduce problems
  with existing specifications\n  where some type hints (using 'a') are needed to
  properly type entries in groups,\n  where previously they were unambiguous.\n\n
  \ Note that it is not yet supported to use a group inside a map, where the\n  issue
  of merging keys arises.\n\n## O.3.5.0\n\n* Add support for constraints on references
  and generic references.\n* Add support for using references as range bounds. Note
  that this breaks\n  backwards compatibility - because the range arguments are now
  more generic,\n  additional hints are required to type literal numerics correctly.
  Typically\n  this is most easily fixed by adding a call `int` for any numeric literals
  in\n  ranges. An example is shown in `example/Conway.hs`\n\n## 0.3.3.0\n\n* Introduce
  HuddleM, another way to define a Huddle spec. This allows total\n  control over
  the order that items are presented in the CDDL, at the cost\n  of making it somewhat
  harder to re-use items (they need to be returned from\n  the monad).\n\n## 0.3.2.0\n\n*
  Leading rather than trailing commas in the pretty printer.\n\n## 0.3.1.0\n\n* `collectFrom`
  now adds a first definition in the generated Huddle referencing\n  the top level
  elements, to be compatible with the CDDL spec.\n\n## 0.3.0.1\n\n* Improvements in
  the pretty printer - various groups should be formatted more\n  cleanly\n\n## 0.3.0.0\n\n*
  Rationalise the choice operators. Drop (//) and provide detailed comments\n  explaining
  the use of (/).\n\n## 0.1.0.0\n\n* First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n"

description: |-
  Cuddle is a library for generating and manipulating [CDDL](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610).

  Included in this package is a command line tool for working with CDDL files. It
  currently supports four functions:

  - Formatting of CDDL files
  - Validating that a CDDL file is legal
  - Generating random CBOR terms matching CDDL productions
  - Testing compliance of a CBOR file against a CDDL spec.
