  # Change Log (curlhs)


  ## [Release 0.1.6][0.1.6] 2015-05-20

  ### Added
  - Support for `CURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION` added ([Issue #5]).
  - Change log added.

  ### Changed
  - Requirement to explicit use of `loadlib`/`freelib` removed.
  The process of loading and initializing *libcurl* is automatically
  performed when *curlhs* is loaded/linked, and the process of cleanup
  and unloading is performed when *curlhs* is unloaded/unlinked.
  Indirectly inspired by the discussion on [Issue #3].

  - Tests, examples and documentation updated accordingly.

  ### Deprecated
  - Module `Network.CURL000` and its contents (`loadlib`/`freelib` etc.)
  will be removed in the future versions.

  ### Fixed
  - Fixed bug which caused segfaults when more than one *callback type*
  or *slist type* option was used on the same handle.



  ## [Release 0.1.5][0.1.5] 2015-04-27

  ### Fixed
  - Tests updated for newer `hspec` package version ([Issue #4]).



  ## [Release 0.1.4][0.1.4] 2015-04-23

  ### Fixed
  - Building errors on OS X platform fixed ([Issue #2]).
  - Large negative literals warning fixed.
  - GHC 7.10 warnings fixed.



  ## [Release 0.1.3][0.1.3] 2014-10-03

  ### Fixed
  - Documentation links fixed.



  ## [Release 0.1.2][0.1.2] 2014-10-02

  ### Added
  - Documentation browser added (simple markdown viewer).
  - Short tutorial and few simple examples added.
  - Basic test suite added.

  ### Changed
  - `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST` option type changed to `Bool`.



  ## [Release 0.1.1][0.1.1] 2014-08-14

  ### Fixed
  - Version boundaries for `base` package added.



  ## [Release 0.1.0][0.1.0] 2014-08-14

  # Network.CURL [![Hackage][hackage.img]][hackage.htm] [![Build Status][travis.img]][travis.htm]

  Package [*curlhs*][hackage.htm] provides a mid-level [Haskell][haskell.htm]
  interface to *libcurl*, the multiprotocol file transfer library which powers
  the popular tool *curl* (please see <http://curl.haxx.se/> for more info
  about *curl* and *libcurl*).

  # Documentation
  More info about *curlhs*, such as tutorials or examples, may be found in the
  [docs](docs) section. Please check out the short [tutorial](docs/tutorial.md)
  about installation and basic usage of *curlhs* and *libcurl*.
