description: |-
  Cut a file into chunks according to a position list
  and concatenate the chunks.
  The chunks must not overlap and must be in increasing order.

  Use it this way:

  > cutter positions.csv <datain >dataout

  The file @positions.csv@ must be a comma separated spreadsheet file (CSV),
  where the first column contains the chunk beginnings
  and the second column contains the pause beginnings.
  A pause begins one byte after a chunk ends.
  The other columns are ignored and may contain annotations of the chunks.

  The positions file may also contain line numbers.
  In this case you run the command this way:

  > cutter -l positions.csv <datain >dataout

  Example: remove selected attachments from e-mails in mbox file
  using the @lsmbox@ command from <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mbox-utility>.
