  The cuSolver library provides useful LAPACK-like features implemented on NVIDIA
  GPUs, such as common matrix factorization and triangular solve routines for
  dense matrices, a sparse least-squares solver routine, and an eigenvalue solver.
  This package provides FFI bindings to the functions of the cuSolver library. You
  will need to install the CUDA driver and developer toolkit:
