description: |-
  Hemkay (An M.K. Player Whose Name Starts with an H) is a simple
  music module player that performs all the mixing in Haskell.  It
  supports the popular ProTracker format and some of its variations
  with different numbers of channels.

  This package contains the mixing routines, which can be reused in
  any application.  The output can be written into a file or played
  back in real time.
