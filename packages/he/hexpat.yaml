description: |-
  This package provides a general purpose Haskell XML library using Expat to
  do its parsing (<http://expat.sourceforge.net/> - a fast stream-oriented XML
  parser written in C).  It is extensible to any string type, with @String@,
  @ByteString@ and @Text@ provided out of the box.

  Basic usage: Parsing a tree (/Tree/), formatting a tree (/Format/).
  Other features: Helpers for processing XML trees (/Proc/), trees annotated with
  XML source location (/Annotated/), extended XML trees with comments,
  processing instructions, etc (/Extended/), XML cursors (/Cursor/),
  SAX-style parse (/SAX/), and access to the low-level interface in case speed
  is paramount (/Internal.IO/).

  The design goals are speed, speed, speed, interface simplicity and modularity.

  For introduction and examples, see the /Text.XML.Expat.Tree/ module. For benchmarks,
  <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hexpat/>

  If you want to do interactive I\/O, an obvious option is to use lazy parsing
  with one of the lazy I\/O functions such as hGetContents.  However, this can be
  problematic in some applications because it doesn't handle I\/O errors properly
  and can give no guarantee of timely resource cleanup. Because of the generalized
  list, Hexpat is designed to allow for chunked I/O, but as of this writing I haven't
  done a nice integration with enumerator and friends.

  /IO/ is filed under /Internal/ because it's low-level and most users won't want
  it.  The other /Internal/ modules are re-exported by /Annotated/, /Tree/ and /Extended/,
  so you won't need to import them directly.

  If you have trouble building on Windows, you can try the bundle flag. This will
  make it build from the source of libexpat bundled inside the hexpat package:
  cabal install -f bundle hexpat

  Credits to Iavor Diatchki and the @xml@ (XML.Light) package for /Proc/ and /Cursor/.
  Thanks to the many contributors.

  ChangeLog: 0.15 changes intended to fix a (rare) \"error: a C finalizer called back into Haskell.\"
  that seemed only to happen only on ghc6.12.X; 0.15.1 Fix broken Annotated parse;
  0.16 switch from mtl to transformers; 0.17 fix mapNodeContainer & rename some things.;
  0.18 rename defaultEncoding to overrideEncoding. 0.18.3 formatG and indent were demanding list
  items more than once (inefficient in chunked processing); 0.19 add Extended.hs;
  0.19.1 fix a memory leak introduced in 0.19, delegate parsing to bound thread
  if unbound (see note above); 0.19.2 include expat source code so \'cabal install\' just works
  on Linux, Mac and Windows (thanks Jacob Stanley); 0.19.3 fix misconfiguration of expat
  which broke entity parsing; 0.19.4 bump version constraint for text; 0.19.5 bump text
  to < 0.12 and fix text-0.10.0.1 breakage; 0.19.6 dependency breakage with List;
  0.19.7 ghc-7.2.1 compatibility; 0.19.8 fix space leak on lazy parse under ghc-7.2.1;
  0.19.9 fix formatting of > character + improve performance; 0.19.10 ghc-7.4.x compatibility;
  0.20.1 fix an unfortunate crash when used in parallel processing and greatly improve
  performance; 0.20.2 make parseSaxG lazier; 0.20.3 minor build issues; 0.20.4 remove
  dependency on extensible-exceptions; 0.20.5 bump text upper bound; 0.20.6 bump text again
  to include 1.1.x.x; 0.20.7 bump text again for 1.2.x.x; 0.20.8 bump utf8-string dep;
  0.20.9 bump deepseq dep/ghc-7.10 compatibility.; 0.20.10 increase dependency upper bounds;
  0.20.11 update to libexpat-2.2.1 which includes several security fixes;
  0.20.12 use the system libexpat by default, but provide a bundle flag to allow a bundled
  copy of expat to be used, which might make life easier on Windows: cabal install -f bundle
  hexpat; 0.20.13 Fix some mistakes made in 0.20.12 cabal file.
