  Hetris 0.1.0
  ============

  A quick guide to building:

  ./configure --prefix=/wherever/you/want/it
  make
  make install

  If you make changes to the code, in particular the imports, you may need
  to also run make dep.


  All of my code is released under the GNU GPL version 2. The files in the
  CTAN directory was written by other people and their licences apply.


  Enjoy!
  Ian
