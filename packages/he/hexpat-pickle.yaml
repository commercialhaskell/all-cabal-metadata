description: |-
  A library of combinators that allows Haskell data structures to be pickled
  (serialized) to/from XML via the Tree datatype defined in the hexpat package.
  It is source-code-similar to the pickling functionality of the HXT package,
  to ease the transition between the two libraries. This implementation is
  faster but less complete than HXT.  Unlike some other picklers, it also supports
  /lazy unpickling/.

  This package does not depend on HXT.
