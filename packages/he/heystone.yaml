  # Heystone - Haskell bindings for the Keystone assembler framework
  [keystone-gh]: https://github.com/keystone-engine/keystone
  [keystone-gh-hs]: https://github.com/keystone-engine/keystone/tree/master/bindings/haskell
  [hapstone-gh]: https://github.com/ibabushkin/hapstone

  Haskell bindings for [Keystone][keystone-gh], a powerful multi-architecture
  assembler framework.

  This package is derived from the Haskell bindings at
  [keystone-engine/keystone][keystone-gh-hs], which at the time were highly usable
  but unmaintained and never uploaded to Hackage. To not obstruct a potential
  future official package (and to give myself flexibility), I'm appropriating
  [Hapstone][hapstone-gh]'s naming convention.

  ## Usage
  Specify as a dependency in your Cabal file (or Stack, but you'll have to
  register it as an `extra-dep`).

  You will need the Keystone engine installed. It's not packaged on many systems,
  so you many wish to check the [Keystone
  docs](https://www.keystone-engine.org/docs/) for instructions. For my fellow
  Arch Linux fiends, it's in the main repos:

      pacman -S keystone

  ## Examples
  To build a sample (after having built and installed the Haskell bindings):

  ```
  $ cd bindings/haskell
  $ ghc --make samples/Sample.hs
  ```
