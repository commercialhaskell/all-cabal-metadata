  # Heavy log shortcuts

  An alternative shortcut api for heavy-logger.
  This has infected several of my projects already so I'm
  putting it online.
  Although, it maybe better to use someting like [katip](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/katip)
  I just don't want to invest the time into learning another logging framework.

  Removes the vars functionality, fixes not being able to use '{}'.
  Puts in place some sane default shortcuts.

  If we don't want data use:

  ```haskell
  debug0 "msg"
  ```

  if we do want data (which is almost always the case):

  ```haskell
  debug "msg" somedata
  ```

  If we want multiple datas:

  ```haskell
  debug "msg" (onedata, twodata)
  ```

  I usually import this module qualified as Log,
  then you can do:

  ```haskell
  Log.debug "oh no my house is on fire" house
  ```

  Now it reads almost like a sentence.
