description: ! '# hex-text


  `hex-text` is a small library for converting between `ByteString`s and their representations
  as hexidecimal numbers encoded as `Text`.


  A `ByteString` is a list of bytes. A byte is a number between 0 and 255, represented
  by the `Word8` type. In a fixed-width hexidecimal representation, the lowest byte
  0 is represented by the hex string `00`, and the greatest byte 255 is represented
  by the hex string `ff`. So, for example, the `ByteString` consisting of bytes \[
  1, 2, 3, 253, 254, 255 \] is represented as `010203fdfeff`.


  ```haskell

  λ> import Text.Hex (encodeHex)

  λ> import Data.ByteString (pack)


  λ> (encodeHex . pack) [1, 2, 3, 253, 254, 255]

  "010203fdfeff"

  ```
