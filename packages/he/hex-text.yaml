  # hex-text

  `hex-text` is a small library for converting between `ByteString`s and their representations as hexidecimal numbers encoded as `Text`.

  # Motivation

  When using Stripe for payments, Stripe sends a signature as a hexidecimal `Text` value. The `cryptonite` package can be used to verify the signature, but it requires `ByteString` values, not `Text`.

  # Example usage

  A `ByteString` is a list of bytes. A byte is a number between 0 and 255, represented by the `Word8` type. In a fixed-width hexidecimal representation, the lowest byte 0 is represented by the hex string `00`, and the greatest byte 255 is represented by the hex string `ff`. So, for example, the `ByteString` consisting of bytes \[ 1, 2, 3, 253, 254, 255 \] is represented as `010203fdfeff`.

  ```haskell
  λ> import Text.Hex (encodeHex)
  λ> import Data.ByteString (pack)

  λ> (encodeHex . pack) [1, 2, 3, 253, 254, 255]
  "010203fdfeff"
  ```
