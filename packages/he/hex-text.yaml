description: "# hex-text\n\n`hex-text` is a small library for converting between `ByteString`s
  and their representations as hexidecimal numbers encoded as `Text`.\n\n# Motivation\n\nWhen
  using Stripe for payments, Stripe sends a signature as a hexidecimal `Text` value.
  The `cryptonite` package can be used to verify the signature, but it requires `ByteString`
  values, not `Text`. \n\n# Example usage\n\nA `ByteString` is a list of bytes. A
  byte is a number between 0 and 255, represented by the `Word8` type. In a fixed-width
  hexidecimal representation, the lowest byte 0 is represented by the hex string `00`,
  and the greatest byte 255 is represented by the hex string `ff`. So, for example,
  the `ByteString` consisting of bytes \\[ 1, 2, 3, 253, 254, 255 \\] is represented
  as `010203fdfeff`.\n\n```haskell\nλ> import Text.Hex (encodeHex)\nλ> import Data.ByteString
  (pack)\n\nλ> (encodeHex . pack) [1, 2, 3, 253, 254, 255]\n\"010203fdfeff\"\n```\n\n"
