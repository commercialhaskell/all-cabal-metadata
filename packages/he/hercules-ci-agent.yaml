synopsis: Runs Continuous Integration tasks on your machines
changelog: "# Changelog\n\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented
  in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)\nand
  this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\n\n##
  [0.8.1]\n\n### Added\n\n - Attach user-defined labels to the agent, for retrieval
  via the API.\n\n### Fixed\n\n - Fix an issue where long-runnin nix methods weren't
  interrupted\n - Fix error `mkdir /run/runc: permission denied`\n\n## [0.8.0]\n\n###
  Added\n\n - Hercules CI Effects, a new feature for running programs that interact
  with\n   the real world, with useful features for continous deployment.\n\n    -
  Effects only run after the build completes successfully\n\n    - Effects are defined
  like a derivation, not unlike a Nix shell\n\n    - Independent processes can run
  concurrently as distinct effects\n\n    - No two commits in the same repo run effects
  at the same time; no need to\n      worry about concurrency in deployment scripts\n\n
  \   - Effects each run in their own sandbox with access to network, Nix store,\n
  \     remote state file API and secrets\n\n    - Secrets are configured locally
  on your agents, so you don't have to trust\n      a third party with your cloud
  credentials\n\n - Hercules CI Agent is now a flake. The highlights are\n    - `nixosModules`
  overriding the NixOS-distributed module to the in-repo version\n      - `agent-profile`
  for agent machines, or\n      - `agent-service` for just the service definition\n
  \   - `packages`\n      - `hercules-ci-cli` the user command line interface\n      -
  `hercules-ci-agent` for custom installation methods, etc\n\n - The `hci` command
  (flake: `defaultApp`)\n    - `hci login` to authenticate yourself\n    - `hci state`
  to work with Effects state files\n    - `hci effect` to run effects locally\n\n
  - Commit metadata as a `ci.nix` argument. Make your `ci.nix` a function:\n\n   ```nix\n
  \  { src ? { ref = null; rev = null; }}:\n   # rest of your ci.nix\n   ```\n\n   `src.ref`
  will have e.g. `refs/heads/master` and `rev` will have the\n   git commit SHA.\n\n
  - Shell derivations will only be built for their dependencies. Add a\n   `mkShell`-based
  expression like you would add a derivation.\n\n   This behavior can be requested
  explicitly for shells and non-shell\n   derivations alike by appending ` // { buildDependenciesOnly
  = true; }` to\n   the attribute definition.\n\n - Attributes can now be marked to
  require or ignore a build failure in the\n   derivation it references directly.\n
  \  (see [support#34](https://github.com/hercules-ci/support/issues/34))\n\n - `concurrentTasks`
  now has a default, `\"auto\"` for ease of setup and to help\n   avoid underutilization.\n\n###
  Fixed\n\n - The parent directory name will match the repo name [support#40](https://github.com/hercules-ci/support/issues/40)\n\n
  - Previously, lines from Nix's configured netrc file were ignored. Now they are
  appended to Hercules CI's netrc lines.\n\n### Changed\n\n - Cachix caches without
  `signingKeys` will be pushed to, as part of the recently\n   introduced write token
  feature (Cachix-managed signing keys)\n\n\n## [0.7.5] - 2020-11-27\n\n### Fixed\n\n
  - GHC 8.10.2 compatibility for NixOS unstable / NixOS 21.03\n\n - Build with cachix
  0.5.1. Write token support is not included due to a break configuration semantics.
  It will be available in >= 0.8.\n\n### Changed\n\n - The in-repo expressions have
  upgraded their dependency to NixOS 20.09\n\n - Agent will now use `HERCULES_CI_API_BASE_URL`
  over `HERCULES_API_BASE_URL` if set.\n\n - Temporarily switch to cabal tooling due
  to breakage. `master` continues to be stack-based.\n\n## [0.7.4] - 2020-08-25\n\n###
  Fixed\n\n - Paths that are missing from the binary cache will be rebuilt. This affected\n
  \  agent 0.7 - 0.7.3 users with trusted user optimizations turned on, which is\n
  \  the default when using the NixOS or nix-darwin modules.\n\n - Prevent states
  where no progress can be made. One caused by a potential buildup\n   of batched
  messages that may not fit within the timeout interval; the other\n   a receive operation
  without a timeout during the initial socket handshake.\n\n - The log socket will
  remain open instead of reconnecting unnecessarily.\n\n - Add a safety measure to
  prevent unintended increases in workload in case\n   Nix sees an opportunity for
  concurrency that was not intended by Hercules CI.\n\n### Changed\n\n - The NixOS
  module in the hercules-ci-agent repo now disables the upcoming\n   module that is
  packaged upstream with NixOS.\n\n   The upstream module will configure fewer things
  for you, to be in line with\n   normal NixOS expectations. Notably, it does not
  configure automatic garbage\n   collection and it does not preconfigure NixOps keys
  deployment.\n\n   The configuration interface in the hercules-ci-agent repo will
  remain unchanged for `0.7` but `0.8` will\n   match the upstream interface.\n\n##
  [0.7.3] - 2020-07-18\n\n### Added\n\n - Evaluation log\n\n - Configurable log level
  via config file or `extraOptions`\n\n### Changed\n\n - Default log level is `InfoS`
  rather than `DebugS`\n\n## [0.7.2] - 2020-06-18\n\n### Changed\n\n - cachix: 0.3.7
  -> 0.3.8. Improves reliability through better retries and improves error reporting\n\n##
  [0.7.1] - 2020-06-17\n\n### Added\n\n - Push to any nix store, including S3, using
  the `NixCache` kind in `binary-caches.json`\n\n### Changed\n\n - Switch to Nixpkgs
  20.03\n\n - Environment variables are now passed on to evaluation and build by default.
  This allows configuration to be passed to Nix without intervention from hercules-ci-agent.\n\n
  - `trusted-user` is not a requirement and is configured automatically when using
  the NixOS module or nix-darwin module.\n\n### Fixed\n\n - Agent will now reset its
  connection with hercules-ci.com when pings are not acknowledged in time.\n\n - Prevent
  running out of file descriptors by increasing the soft limit if possible.\n\n##
  [0.7.0] - 2020-05-05\n\n### Known issues\n\n - Agent process user must be in `trusted-users`.
  This is the case with the NixOS and nix-darwin module. Doing so is recommended for
  ease of use and performance but should not be a requirement.\n\n### Added\n\n -
  Jobs can be cancelled\n\n - Build logs are streamed in realtime\n\n - The build
  log now has timestamps and color\n\n - Distributed builds performance has improved
  by fetching fewer derivations\n\n### Fixed\n\n - Extra nix options were not passed
  to the build process\n\n## [0.6.6] - 2020-03-16\n\n### Fixed\n\n - NixOS, nix-darwin
  modules: check the `nix-daemon` source and add option to patch an in-memory cache
  expiry issue\n   causing errors in build clusters (of more than 1 machine). The
  module asks for confirmation.\n\n - **Manual action:** if you are not using the
  provided module and you run the agent on\n   more than one machine, and you use
  `nix-daemon`, to fix above issue, you need to:\n    - either upgrade your system's
  Nix to a recent `master` or version 2.4.0 when released,\n    - or apply this patch
  to your system's Nix installation: https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/3405\n\n -
  Cachix: 0.3.5 -> [0.3.7](https://github.com/cachix/cachix/blob/master/cachix/CHANGELOG.md#037---2020-03-12)
  to prevent uploading bad NARs in rare cases.\n\n## [0.6.5] - 2020-03-07\n\n### Fixed\n\n
  - Work around a systemd behavior where it didn't restart the unit\n\n### Added\n\n
  - `--test-configuration` flag to validate the configuration without actually running
  the agent.\n\n## [0.6.4] - 2020-03-06\n\n### Fixed\n\n - Fix a bug blocking evaluation
  when a store path is removed from cache or cache configuration is changed.\n\n###
  Added\n\n - Cached builds to speed up `aarch64-linux` agent deployments.\n\n###
  [0.6.3] - 2020-02-19\n\n### Fixed\n\n - Fix a concurrency problem causing not all
  evaluation events to be written to server when evaluation fails.\n\n - Fix evaluation
  errors triggered by build outputs go missing from cache, by requesting a forced
  rebuild.\n\n - Fix blocked shutdown on NixOS, fix agent status in dashboard, by
  stopping agent before network shutdown #195.\n\n - Fix upload of large outputs by
  using the correct http client manager for Cachix, removing a timeout.\n\n### Changed\n\n
  - Agent will now try to verify that the nix-daemon has narinfo-cache-negative-ttl
  = 0. This is required for correct operation.\n\n### [0.6.2] - 2020-01-30\n\n###
  Fixed\n\n - Update cachix to support the API change for the new CDN. This update
  is\n   required for uploading sources and compressed outputs over 100MB in size.\n
  \  Please update.\n\n### [0.6.1] - 2019-11-06\n\n### Fixed\n\n - Fix token leak
  to system log when reporting an HTTP exception. This was introduced by a library
  upgrade.\n   This was discovered after tagging 0.6.0 but before the release was\n
  \  announced and before moving of the `stable` branch.\n   Only users of the `hercules-ci-agent`
  `master` branch and the unannounced\n   tag were exposed to this leak.\n   We recommend
  to follow the `stable` branch.\n\n - Temporarily revert a Nix GC configuration change
  that might cause problems\n   until agent gc root behavior is improved.\n\n### [0.6.0]
  - 2019-11-04\n\n### Changed\n\n - Switch to Nix 2.3 and NixOS 19.09. *You should
  update your deployment to reflect the NixOS upgrade*, unless you're using terraform
  or nix-darwin, where it's automatic.\n - Increased parallellism during push to cachix\n
  - Switch to NixOS 19.09\n - Enable min-free/max-free Nix GC\n\n### Fixed\n\n - Transient
  errors during source code fetching are now retried\n - Fixed a bug related to narinfo
  caching in the context of IFD\n - Fixed an exception when the root of ci.nix is
  a list, although lists are unsupported\n\n## [0.5.0] - 2019-10-01\n\n### Added\n\n-
  Now deployable with [terraform-hercules-ci](https://github.com/hercules-ci/terraform-hercules-ci)\n\n###
  Changed\n\n- The `binary-caches.json` file can now be deployed like any other confidential
  file. Its contents are not required at module evaluation time any more.\n\n- The
  `services.hercules-ci-agent.binaryCachesFile` option has been removed.\n\n  **NixOps
  users**: rename to `deployment.keys.\"binary-caches.json\".file`\n\n  **Others**:
  remove your `binaryCachesFile` value. Make sure `binary-caches.json` is deployed.\n\n-
  The `binary-caches.json` file is now required. The empty object `{}` is a\n  valid
  file, but we highly recommend to configure a cache.\n\n\n### Fixed\n\n - The agent
  will now actually auto-restart when the secrets files change.\n\n\n## [0.4.0] -
  2019-08-30\n\n### Added\n\n- Support for import-from-derivation. See https://blog.hercules-ci.com/2019/08/30/native-support-for-import-for-derivation/
  for details.\n\n### Changed\n\n\n- Report build failures and technical errors (misconfigurations,
  etc) separately\n\n- Remove HerculesScribe\n\n- Worker now uses structured logging
  (including worker pid, etc)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Disable parallel GHC GC to improve
  runtime performance\n\n- Bump Cachix to fix a few bugs (errors with too many derivations,
  performance fixes, etc.)\n\n - Modern BoehmGC initial settings for Nix memory limits
  \n\n## [0.3.2] - 2019-08-11\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Deploying the agent from different
  system (darwin to linux) resulted into\n  using the wrong executable\n\n\n## [0.3.1]
  - 2019-08-07\n\n### Changed\n\n- Emit a log when evaluator starts to push to cachix\n\n-
  Increase attribute limit to 50k\n\n- Pin nixpkgs commit and speed up compilation
  via https://hercules-ci.cachix.org\n\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Possible exception during
  evaluation was not propagated,\n  resulting into lack of retries\n\n- #8: Refresh
  agent session on cluster join token change\n\n- Fix segfault on involved IFD project
  (remove a finalizer)\n\n- Cachix: fix a crash with a lot of attributes (when determining
  closure graph)\n\n## [0.3.0] - 2019-07-05\n\n### Changed\n\n- Configuration of the
  agent is now done via `--config agent.toml`\n  so all command line arguments were
  removed.\n\n  See https://docs.hercules-ci.com/#agent-configuration-file\n\n- NixOS-based
  deployments now require `enable`.\n\n      services.hercules-ci-agent.enable = true;\n\n-
  All files are placed/expected in new locations that by default derive\n  from the
  `baseDirectory` option in the `agent.toml` file.\n\n  You may remove `~/.hercules-ci-agent`
  and `~/.local/share/hercules-ci-agent` after upgrading.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Added
  retries to status reporting to fix potential\n  inconsistencies on the service\n\n###
  Added\n\n- Added Cachix support, for multi-agent and multi-platform support\n\n-
  Report derivation outputs with their size and hashes\n\n- Added Darwin support via
  nix-darwin\n\n- Support `requiredFeatures` attribute on derivations\n\n- Hello and
  hearthbeat protocol, which will allow the\n  service to be aware of how the agent
  is configured and\n  when it's online.\n\n## [0.2] - 2019-05-14\n\n- use [gitignore]
  instead of [nix-gitignore]\n- fix build on Darwin\n- limit internal concurrency
  to max eight OS threads for beefier machines\n- show version on `--help`\n- build
  against NixOS 19.03 as default\n- propagate agent information to agent view: Nix
  version, substituters,\n  platform and Nix features\n\n## [0.1.1] - 2019-04-16\n\n###
  Added\n\n- Support ci.nix or nix/ci.nix along with default.nix\n\n## [0.1.0.0] -
