  #+TITLE: heddit

  ~heddit~ is a Reddit API client library for Haskell. It aims to be (almost) as comprehensive as libraries such as  [[https://github.com/praw-dev/praw][praw]], from which it takes major inspiration. Although it is not quite there, it does offer access to various parts of the Reddit API, including:
   - comments and submissions
   - user accounts and private messages
   - subreddits, wikis, collections, and emojis
   - live threads
   - moderation and various mod actions
   - ... and more

  To start using ~heddit~, visit [[file:./doc/start.org][the (very) quick start guide]] or browse the haddocks in [[file:./src/Network][src/Network]]

  *WARNING*: ~heddit~ is /definitely/ alpha-quality at the moment. Expect bugs, instability, and incomplete documentation for now!

  * Table of Contents
  - [[file:./doc/start.org][Quick start]]
  - [[file:./doc/auth.org][Authenticating]]
  - [[Caveats]]
  - [[Examples]]
  - [[Tests]]
  - [[License]]

  * Caveats
  There are some major caveats to using ~heddit~ that you may want to consider before deciding to use it, namely:
  - It is currently alpha quality. It needs more tests and users to work out some of the bugs that are assuredly lurking deep within. The exposed API is a little weird and may be difficult to work with.
  - The Reddit API seems overwhemlingly geared towards dynamic representations of data. This can cause obvious issues when decoding its JSON responses in Haskell. If an exception is thrown when trying to hit an endpoint, please let me know by opening an issue or PR!
  - ~heddit~ only supports authenticating via OAuth (see [[file:./doc/auth.org][Authenticating]]) and cannot access Reddit's old JSON API. This means that it is not possible to create a truly anonymous client. Instead, you must register all applications, even those without a user context.

  * Examples
  I would like to add some more executable examples of how to use ~heddit~, particularly to demonstrate some of the weirder points of the API. At the moment, the available example programs are:
  - Getting an initial [[file:./examples/RefreshTokens.hs][refresh token]]

  * Tests
  ~heddit~ has two test suites: a simple test of JSON decoding of API responses that runs by default, and the ~io-tests~ that are disabled by default behind a flag of the same name. If you wish to run the ~io-tests~, be aware that these make real requests against Reddit's API endpoints using the authenticated account. After enabling the tests, make sure to create an ~auth.ini~ and ~profile.json~ in the working directory or in ~$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/heddit~. See the ~io-tests~ modules for more info.

  * License
  ~heddit~ is distributed under a three-clause BSD license. See [[file:LICENSE][the license]] for details. Parts of this library are directly inspired by and/or adapted from ~praw~, which is distributed under a simplified BSD two-clause license.
