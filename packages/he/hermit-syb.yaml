description: |-
  A HERMIT plugin for GHC which optimizes SYB generic traversals to achieve equivalent performance to hand-written traversals.

  Details can be found in the paper: <http://michaeldadams.org/papers/syb-opt/>

  Note: This compiler plugin requires GHC 7.8 (or HEAD) and specially compiled copies of base, ghc-prim, and syb.
  Up-to-date instructions can be found at: <https://github.com/ku-fpg/hermit/wiki/GHC-HEAD>. We are working to
  lift these requirements.

  As an example, we apply the optimization to Foo.hs, which contains the following code:

  @
  module Main where

  import Data.Generics
  import HERMIT.Optimization.SYB.Prelude

  main :: IO ()
  main = print (mapInt (+1) [1..10])

  mapInt :: (Int -> Int) -> [Int] -> [Int]
  mapInt f = everywhere (mkT f)
  @

  Note that importing @HERMIT.Optimization.SYB.Prelude@ is required in any module targeted for optimization.

  To compile Foo.hs with the optimization:

  @
  $ hermit Foo.hs -opt=HERMIT.Optimization.SYB +Main mapInt
  @

  This invokes GHC with a specific set of flags. These flags may be used instead of the 'hermit' program itself, or placed in a cabal file.

  The first argument to HERMIT is the target file. Next is the -opt flag, which specifies the plugin name.
  Then follows one or more target module names, each beginning with a plus sign. After each target module is a list of targeted functions.
  The distinguished 'interactive' target will run the optimization on any other targets and then enter the HERMIT interactive shell.
  The distinguished 'interactive-only' target will open the HERMIT shell before optimization.
  HERMIT commands specific to this optimization are available for interactive use.
