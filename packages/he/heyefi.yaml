description: ! "# heyefi\n\nheyefi is a Linux system daemon that listens for Eye-Fi
  SD card and processes the requested file upload requests made by the card. This
  project is not endorsed by Eye-Fi Inc.\n\n# Installation\n\nheyefi is meant to be
  run as a system daemon. It currently needs to run as root, to make the file permissions
  part work with less configuration. (It currently sets the permissions of the files
  to the same as the upload directory. Let me know if you have ideas on how to do
  that [without being root](https://github.com/ryantm/heyefi/issues/4)!) It expects
  a configuration file to be at /etc/heyefi/heyefi.config.\n\nThis program is available
  through Nix, and it can be easily installed on Nixos. It can be installed on any
  Linux distribution like this:\n\n1. Put a configuration file at /etc/heyefi/heyefi.config
  (format described in the \"Configuration\" section below)\n2. Install Nix `curl
  https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh`\n3. Install heyefi `nix-env -iA nixpkgs.heyefi`.
  The server binary should now be on your path as `heyefi`.\n4. Find the absolute
  path of heyefi with `readlink $(which heyefi)` (For example, on one system it was
  /nix/store/b4m467s0byr1v2xfd7acwpq5x4l2dp8f-heyefi-1.1.0.0/bin/heyefi)\n5. Make
  a systemd service (or whatever equivalent for your system) that runs the server
  binary as the root user\n\n# Configuration\n\nThe configuration file has the following
  options:\n\ncards: a list of Eye-Fi card credentials. The format of the list is
  [[\"macaddress1\",\"uploadkey1\"],[\"macaddress2\",\"uploadkey2\"],...]\n\nupload_dir:
  an string that is an absolute path to where the files get put after they come off
  the card.\n\nComplete example config with two cards:\n\n```haskell\ncards = [[\"0012342de4ce\",\"e7403a0123402ca062\"],[\"1234562d5678\",\"12342a062\"]]\nupload_dir
  = \"/data/unsorted\"\n```\n\n# NixOS configuration\n\nThere is a NixOS service definition
  for heyefi. It currently only supports one card's credentials.\n\nComplete example
  configuration:\n\n```nix\n{\n  services.heyefi.enable = true;\n  services.heyefi.cardMacaddress
  = \"0012342de4ce\";\n  services.heyefi.uploadKey = \"e7403a0123402ca062\";\n  services.heyefi.uploadDir
  = /data/unsorted;\n}\n```\n\n# Development\n\n```bash\nnix-shell\n```\n\n\n# Changelog\n\n2.0.0.1
  2017-12-06 Makes tests pass fixing nix build\n2.0.0.0 2017-11-18 Program output
  should be immediately written to stdout, instead of being buffered until the program
  finishes.\n1.1.0.0 2017-01-02 fixed build of version 0.13.0.0 of optparse-applicative,
  which removes Data.Monoid exports\n"
