  # Hetzner Haskell Library

  ## Description

  Client interface for the [Hetzner Cloud API](https://docs.hetzner.cloud)
  and the [Hetzner DNS API](https://dns.hetzner.com/api-docs),
  written in the [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) programming language.

  ## Completeness

  This library doesn't cover (at least, not yet) the enterity of Hetzner's API.
  However, if there's anything you would like to see added, feel free to
  [open an issue](https://codeberg.org/daniel-casanueva/hetzner/issues/new).
  If it's urgent, send me an email.
  I mainly add features only when I myself need them, but I'd be happy to extend the
  library upon request. Of course, if you can contribute with a merge request,
  that'd be greatly appreciated. The only ask I have if you decide to contribute
  is to follow more or less the naming and styling already used in the rest of
  the library. Thanks!
