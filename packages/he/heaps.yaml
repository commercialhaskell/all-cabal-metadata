  0.4 [2021.02.17]
  ----------------
  * `heaps` now always exports a `null` function that is specialized to `Heap`,
    i.e.,

    ```haskell
    null :: Heap a -> Bool
    ```

    Previously, this specialized versions of `null` was only exported with GHC
    7.8 or older, and for more recent GHCs, the `Data.Foldable` version was
    exported instead. The exported API is now uniform across all supported
    versions of GHC.
  * Export `adjustMin`.

  0.3.6.1 [2019.02.05]
  --------------------
  * Change to `build-type: Simple`, and drop the `doctests` test suite. This was
    done in an effort to make `heaps`' dependency footprint as minimal as
    possible, since `heaps` is used to bootstrap `shake`.
  * Fix the Haddocks for `span`.

  0.3.6 [2018.01.18]
  ------------------
  * Add `Semigroup` instance for `Heap`.

  0.3.5
  -----
  * Support `doctest-0.12`

  0.3.4.1
  -------
  * Fix a typo in the `doctests` for `mapMonotonic`

  0.3.4
  -----
  * Add `Bifunctor Entry` instance
  * Revamp `Setup.hs` to use `cabal-doctest`. This makes it build
    with `Cabal-2.0`, and makes the `doctest`s work with `cabal new-build` and
    sandboxes.

  0.3.3
  -----
  * Remove redundant constraints
  * Build warning-free on GHC 8.0-rc1

  0.3.2.1
  -------
  * Haddock fix

  0.3.2
  -----
  * Build without warnings on GHC 7.10
  * Overload Foldable `null` and `length` on GHC 7.10+

  0.3.1
  -----
  * Explicit nominal role annotation

  0.3.0.1
  -------
  * Nicer formatting of the haddocks
