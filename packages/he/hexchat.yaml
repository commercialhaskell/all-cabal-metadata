description: ! 'This package builds a shared object ready for loading into HexChat,
  that will compile and interpret scripts written in Haskell; and also a Haskell library
  that said scripts should import and use to interface with HexChat.


  At the moment the scripting interface is not finalized and may (and will) change
  in a future.


  At the moment only Linux is supported.


  For instructions on how to write a script, see the ''HexChat'' module.


  Currently the plugin only understands the classic @/load@, @/unload@, @/reload@
  commands.


  To automatically load the plugin symlink or copy @~\/.cabal\/lib\/libhexchat-haskell.so@
  (or @\/usr\/local\/lib\/libhexchat-haskell.so@) to @~\/.config\/hexchat\/addons\/@
  (or @\/usr\/lib\/hexchat\/plugins\/@).'
