  # Revision history for hegg

  ## Unreleased

  ## 0.4.0.0 -- 2023-06-24

  * Make `Language` a constraint type synonym instead of a standalone empty class
  * Use `QuantifiedConstraints` instead of `Eq1,Ord1,Show1` in the implementation,
      which results in the user only having to provide an `Eq a => Eq (language
      a)` instance rather than a `Eq1 language` one (which is much simpler and can
      usually be done automatically!)
  * Make `_classes` a `Traversal` lens over all e-classes rather than a `Lens` into `IntMap EClass`

  ## 0.3.0.0 -- 2022-12-09

  * A better `Analysis` tutorial in the README.

  * Complete `Analysis` redesign.
      * The `Analysis` class now has two type parameters: a `domain` and a
          `language`, and no longer has an associated type family
      * The analysis no longer has any knowledge of the e-graph:
          * `makeA` now has type `l domain -> domain`, that is, to make a domain
              of a new node we only have to take into consideration the data of
              the sub-nodes of the new node.
          * `joinA` is unchanged.
          * `modifyA` now has type `EClass domain lang -> (EClass domain lang,
              [Fix lang])`. It takes an e-class and optionally modifies it,
              possibly by adding nodes to it. The return value is the modified
              e-class, and a list of expressions from the language to add to the
              e-class.
      * We can now compose analysis and create language-polymorphic analysis. Such
          two examples are the analysis with domain `()` which regardless of the
          language simply ignores the domain: `instance Analysis () l`; and the
          second example is the product of analysis, which composes two separate
          analysis into one: `instance (Analysis a l, Analysis b l) => Analysis
          (a,b) l`.
      * An `EGraph` now also has two type parameters instead of one (the latter is
        the language is the former the domain of the analysis).

  * Allow customization of Schedulers through parameters (by accepting a scheduler
      rather than a proxy for it)

  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2022-09-19

  * Expose `runEqualitySaturation` to run equality saturation on existing e-graphs
      whole instead of focusing on individual expressions
  * (Very) significant performance improvements!
  * Make `CostFunction` polymorphic over the `Cost` type, requiring that type
      to instance `Ord`
  * Make e-graph abstract. The internal structure can still be modified through
      the available lenses in `Data.Equality.Graph.Lens`
  * Fix a bug related to `NodeMap`'s size.

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2022-08-25

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

description: "## hegg\n\nFast equality saturation in Haskell\n\nBased on [*egg: Fast
  and Extensible Equality Saturation*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03082.pdf), [*Relational
  E-matching*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.02290.pdf) and the [rust implementation](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egg).\n\n###
  Equality Saturation and E-graphs\n\nSuggested material on equality saturation and
  e-graphs for beginners\n* (tutorial) https://docs.rs/egg/latest/egg/tutorials/_01_background/index.html\n*
  (5m video) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ap29SzDAzP0\n\n## Equality saturation
  in Haskell\n\nTo get a feel for how we can use `hegg` and do equality saturation
  in Haskell,\nwe'll write a simple numeric *symbolic* manipulation library that can
  simplify expressions\naccording to a set of rewrite rules by leveraging equality
  saturation.\n\nIf you've never heard of symbolic mathematics you might get some
  intuition from\nreading [Let’s Program a Calculus\nStudent](https://iagoleal.com/posts/calculus-symbolic/)
  first.\n\n### Syntax\n\nWe'll start by defining the abstract syntax tree for our
  simple symbolic expressions:\n```hs\ndata SymExpr = Const Double\n             |
  Symbol String\n             | SymExpr :+: SymExpr\n             | SymExpr :*: SymExpr\n
  \            | SymExpr :/: SymExpr\ninfix 6 :+:\ninfix 7 :*:, :/:\n\ne1 :: SymExpr\ne1
  = (Symbol \"x\" :*: Const 2) :/: (Const 2) -- (x*2)/2\n```\n\nYou might notice that
  `(x*2)/2` is the same as just `x`. Our goal is to get\nequality saturation to do
  that for us.\n\nOur second step is to instance `Language` for our `SymExpr`\n\n###
  Language\n\n`Language` is the required constraint on *expressions* that are to be\nrepresented
  in e-graph and on which equality saturation can be run:\n\n```hs\ntype Language
  l = (Traversable l, ∀ a. Ord a => Ord (l a))\n```\n\nTo declare a `Language` we
  must write the \"base functor\" of `SymExpr` (i.e. use\na type parameter where the
  recursion points used to be in the original\n`SymExpr`), then instance `Traversable
  l`, `∀ a. Ord a => Ord (l a)` (we can do\nit automatically through deriving), and
  write an `Analysis` instance for it (see\nnext section).\n\n```hs\ndata SymExpr
  a = Const Double\n               | Symbol String\n               | a :+: a\n               |
  a :*: a\n               | a :/: a\n               deriving (Eq, Ord, Show, Functor,
  Foldable, Traversable)\ninfix 6 :+:\ninfix 7 :*:, :/:\n```\n\nSuggested reading
  on defining recursive data types in their parametrized\nversion: [Introduction To
  Recursion\nSchemes](https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/posts/introduction-to-recursion-schemes.html)\n\nIf
  we now wanted to represent an expression, we'd write it in its\nfixed-point form\n\n```hs\ne1
  :: Fix SymExpr\ne1 = Fix (Fix (Fix (Symbol \"x\") :*: Fix (Const 2)) :/: (Fix (Const
  2))) -- (x*2)/2\n```\nThen, we define an `Analysis` for our `SymExpr`.\n\n### Analysis\n\nE-class
  analysis is first described in [*egg: Fast and Extensible Equality\nSaturation*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03082.pdf)
  as a way to make equality\nsaturation more *extensible*.\n\nWith it, we can attach
  *analysis data* from a semilattice to each e-class. More\ncan be read about e-class
  analysis in the [`Data.Equality.Analsysis`]() module and\nin the paper.\n\nWe can
  easily define constant folding (`2+2` being simplified to `4`) through\nan `Analysis`
  instance.\n\nAn `Analysis` is defined over a `domain` and a `language`. To define
  constant\nfolding, we'll say the domain is `Maybe Double` to attach a value of that
  type to\neach e-class, where `Nothing` indicates the e-class does not currently
  have a\nconstant value and `Just i` means the e-class has constant value `i`.\n\n```hs\ninstance
  Analysis (Maybe Double) SymExpr\n  makeA = ...\n  joinA = ...\n  modifyA = ...\n```\n\nLet's
  now understand and implement the three methods of the analysis instance we want.\n\n`makeA`
  is called when a new e-node is added to a new e-class, and constructs\nfor the new
  e-class a new value of the domain to be associated with it, always\nby accessing
  the associated data of the node's children data.  Its type is `l\ndomain -> domain`,
  so note that the e-node's children associated data is\ndirectly available in place
  of the actual children.\n\nWe want to associate constant data to the e-class, so
  we must find if the\ne-node has a constant value or otherwise return `Nothing`:\n\n```hs\nmakeA
  :: SymExpr (Maybe Double) -> Maybe Int\nmakeA = \\case\n  Const x -> Just x\n  Symbol
  _ -> Nothing\n  x :+: y -> (+) <$> x <*> y\n  x :*: y -> (*) <$> x <*> y\n  x :/:
  y -> (/) <$> x <*> y\n```\n \n`joinA` is called when e-classes c1 c2 are being merged
  into c. In this case, we\nmust join the e-class data from both classes to form the
  e-class data to be\nassociated with new e-class c. Its type is `domain -> domain
  -> domain`.  In our\ncase, to merge `Just _` with `Nothing` we simply take the `Just`,
  and if we\nmerge two e-classes with a constant value (that is, both are `Just`),
  then the\nconstant value is the same (or something went very wrong) and we just
  keep it.\n\n```hs\njoinA :: Maybe Double -> Maybe Double -> Maybe Double\njoinA
  Nothing (Just x) = Just x\njoinA (Just x) Nothing = Just x\njoinA Nothing Nothing
  \ = Nothing\njoinA (Just x) (Just y) = if x == y then Just x else error \"ouch,
  that shouldn't have happened\"\n```\n\nFinally, `modifyA` describes how an e-class
  should (optionally) be modified\naccording to the e-class data and what new language
  expressions are to be added\nto the e-class also w.r.t. the e-class data.\nIts type
  is `EClass domain l -> (EClass domain l, [Fix l])`, where the argument\nis the class
  to modify, the first element of the return tuple is the\n(optionally) modified e-class
  and the second element is a list of the\nexpressions to represent and merge with
  this e-class.\nFor our example, if the e-class has a constant value associated to
  it, we want\nto create a new e-class with that constant value and merge it to this
  e-class.\n\n```hs\n-- import Data.Equality.Graph.Lens ((^.), _data)\nmodifyA ::
  EClass (Maybe Double) SymExpr -> (EClass (Maybe Double) SymExpr, [Fix SymExpr])\nmodifyA
  c = case c^._data of\n              Nothing -> (c, [])\n              Just i  ->
  (c, [Fix (Const i)])\n```\n\nModify is a bit trickier than the other methods, but
  it allows our e-graph to\nchange based on the e-class analysis data. Note that the
  method is optional and\nthere's a default implementation for it which doesn't change
  the e-class or adds\nanything to it. Analysis data can be otherwise used, e.g.,
  to inform rewrite\nconditions.\n\nBy instancing this e-class analysis, all e-classes
  that have a constant value\nassociated to them will also have an e-node with a constant
  value. This is great\nfor our simple symbolic library because it means if we ever
  find e.g. an\nexpression equal to `3+1`, we'll also know it to be equal to `4`,
  which is a\nbetter result than `3+1` (we've then successfully implemented constant
  folding).\n\nIf, otherwise, we didn't want to use an analysis, we could specify
  the analysis\ndomain as `()` which will make the analysis do nothing, because there's
  an\ninstance polymorphic over `lang` for `()` that looks like this:\n\n```hs\ninstance
  Analysis () lang where\n  makeA _ = ()\n  joinA _ _ = ()\n```\n\n### Language, again\n\nWith
  this setup, we can now express that `SymExpr` forms a `Language` which we\ncan represent
  and manipulate in an e-graph by simply instancing it (there are no\nadditional functions
  to define).\n```hs\ninstance Language SymExpr\n```\n\n### Equality saturation\n\nEquality
  saturation is defined as the function\n```hs\nequalitySaturation :: forall l. Language
  l\n                   => Fix l             -- ^ Expression to run equality saturation
  on\n                   -> [Rewrite l]       -- ^ List of rewrite rules\n                   ->
  CostFunction l    -- ^ Cost function to extract the best equivalent representation\n
  \                  -> (Fix l, EGraph l) -- ^ Best equivalent expression and resulting
  e-graph\n```\n\nTo recap, our goal is to reach `x` starting from `(x*2)/2` by means
  of equality\nsaturation.\n\nWe already have a starting expression, so we're missing
  a list of rewrite rules\n(`[Rewrite l]`) and a cost function (`CostFunction`).\n\n###
  Cost function\n\nPicking up the easy one first:\n```hs\ntype CostFunction l cost
  = l cost -> cost\n```\n\nA cost function is used to attribute a cost to representations
  in the e-graph and to extract the best one.\nThe first type parameter `l` is the
  language we're going to attribute a cost to, and\nthe second type parameter `cost`
  is the type with which we will model cost. For\nthe cost function to be valid, `cost`
  must instance `Ord`.\n\nWe'll say `Const`s and `Symbol`s are the cheapest and then
  in increasing cost we\nhave `:+:`, `:*:` and `:/:`, and model cost with the `Int`
  type.\n```hs\ncost :: CostFunction SymExpr Int\ncost = \\case\n  Const  x -> 1\n
  \ Symbol x -> 1\n  c1 :+: c2 -> c1 + c2 + 2\n  c1 :*: c2 -> c1 + c2 + 3\n  c1 :/:
  c2 -> c1 + c2 + 4\n```\n\n### Rewrite rules\n\nRewrite rules are transformations
  applied to matching expressions represented in\nan e-graph.\n\nWe can write simple
  rewrite rules and conditional rewrite rules, but we'll only look at the simple ones.\n\nA
  simple rewrite is formed of its left hand side and right hand side. When the\nleft
  hand side is matched in the e-graph, the right hand side is added to the\ne-class
  where the left hand side was found.\n```hs\ndata Rewrite lang = Pattern lang :=
  Pattern lang          -- Simple rewrite rule\n                  | Rewrite lang :|
  RewriteCondition lang -- Conditional rewrite rule\n```\n\nA `Pattern` is basically
  an expression that might contain variables and which can be matched against actual
  expressions.\n```hs\ndata Pattern lang\n    = NonVariablePattern (lang (Pattern
  lang))\n    | VariablePattern Var\n```\nA patterns is defined by its non-variable
  and variable parts, and can be\nconstructed directly or using the helper function
  `pat` and using\n`OverloadedStrings` for the variables, where `pat` is just a synonym
  for\n`NonVariablePattern` and a string literal `\"abc\"` is turned into a `Pattern`\nconstructed
  with `VariablePattern`.\n\nWe can then write the following very specific set of
  rewrite rules to simplify\nour simple symbolic expressions.\n```hs\nrewrites ::
  [Rewrite SymExpr]\nrewrites =\n  [ pat (pat (\"a\" :*: \"b\") :/: \"c\") := pat
  (\"a\" :*: pat (\"b\" :/: \"c\"))\n  , pat (\"x\" :/: \"x\")               := pat
  (Const 1)\n  , pat (\"x\" :*: (pat (Const 1)))   := \"x\"\n  ]\n```\n### Equality
  saturation, again\n\nWe can now run equality saturation on our expression!\n\n```hs\nlet
  expr = fst (equalitySaturation e1 rewrites cost)\n```\nAnd upon printing we'd see
  `expr = Symbol \"x\"`!\n\nIf we had instead `e2 = Fix (Fix (Fix (Symbol \"x\") :/:
  Fix (Symbol \"x\")) :+:\n(Fix (Const 3))) -- (x/x)+3`, we'd get `expr = Const 4`
  because of our rewrite\nrules put together with our constant folding!\n\nThis was
  a first introduction which skipped over some details but that tried to\nwalk through
  fundamental concepts for using e-graphs and equality saturation\nwith this library.\n\nThe
  final code for this tutorial is available under `test/SimpleSym.hs`\n\nA more complicated
  symbolic rewrite system which simplifies some derivatives and\nintegrals was written
  for the testsuite. It can be found at `test/Sym.hs`.\n\nThis library could also
  be used not only for equality-saturation but also for\nthe equality-graphs and other
  equality-things (such as e-matching) available.\nFor example, using just the e-graphs
  from `Data.Equality.Graph` to improve GHC's\npattern match checker (https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/19272).\n\n##
