  # hwk ![MIT licensed](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

  hwk was originally written by Lukas Martinelli in 2016-2017:
  see the [original README file](README.md.orig).

  <img align="right" alt="hwk" src="hwk.png" />

  **hwk** (pronounced "hawk") is a simple Haskell-based text stream manipulation tool, somewhat similar to tools like **awk** or **sed**.
  `hwk` applies concisely composed pure functions to a list of strings from stdin. Because Haskell is lazy and has a powerful arsenal of functions, there is no need to invent another DSL. Hopefully this tool will also encourage more people to think functionally.

  ## Example

  Change and append a string to each line:
  ```bash
  $ seq 0 2 | hwk --line '(++ ".txt") . show . (+1) . int'
  1.txt
  2.txt
  3.txt
  ```
  or without line-mode: `hwk 'map ((++ ".txt") . show . (+1) . int)'`.

  Sum all negative numbers:
  ```bash
  $ seq -100 100 | hwk 'sum . filter (< 0) . ints'
  -5050
  ```
  The ints function transforms a list of strings into a list of ints

  Factorials in your shell scripts!:
  ```bash
  seq 10 12 | hwk --line 'let {fact 0 = 1; fact n = n * fact (n - 1)} in fact . int'
  3628800
  39916800
  479001600
  ```

  Extract data from a file:
  ```bash
  $ cat /etc/passwd | hwk --line 'reverse . filter (/= "x") . take 3 . splitOn ":"' | head -3
  0 root
  1 bin
  2 daemon
  ```
  (a module defining `splitOn` from the extra or split library needs to be added to the Hwk.hs config file).

  The argument passed to `hwk` must be a valid Haskell function: a function that takes a list of strings and returns a new list or a single value.

  Check where input contains a certain string:
  ```
  $ cat /etc/passwd | hwk --all 'bool "no" "yes" . isInfixOf "1000"'
  yes
  ```

  ## Configuration
  `hwk` uses a Haskell configuration file `~/.config/hwk/Hwk.hs` which provides the context for the hint evaluation of the supplied function.

  The default configuration [Hwk module](data/Hwk.hs) just sets
  the `Prelude`, `Data.List`, and `Data.Char` modules to be imported into the hint interpreter.

  The first time hwk is run it sets up `~/.config/hwk/Hwk.hs`.

  You can add other modules to import or define your own functions in
  `~/.config/hwk/Hwk.hs`.

  After a hwk version update you may wish/have to update up your Hwk.hs file to take account of new changes: a copy of the latest default Hwk.hs is also put in `~/.config/hwk/` with version suffix.

  ## Install
  Either use the `install.sh` script, or install by cabal-install or stack
  as described below:

  ### Install script from source tree or git
  Use `stack unpack hwk` or `git clone https://github.com/juhp/hwk`.

  Then go to the source directory and run the `install.sh` script, which

  - first runs `stack install`
  - then moves the binary installed by `stack install` to `~/.local/lib/hwk`, and sets up a wrapper script `~/.local/bin/hwk` which runs it.

  You may wish to change the resolver in stack.yaml first: it is also used to determine the resolver used by the created `hwk` wrapper script.

  ### cabal
  If you are on a Linux distro with a system installed ghc and Haskell libaries,
  you can install with `cabal install` to make use of them.

  ### stack
  Installing by stack is better if you do not have a system ghc
  and/or global system Haskell libraries installed.

  Alternatively to install by hand: run `stack install`,
  and then run it with `stack exec hwk ...` using the same resolver.

  ## How does `hwk` work?

  - `hwk` use the hint library to evaluate haskell functions on standard input.
  - By default it splits the input to a list of lines: `[String] -> ToList a`
  - Use `-a` or `--all` to apply a function to all the input: `String -> Tolist a`

  ## Supported return types

  By default the following instances of the `ToList` class are defined:

  - `String`
  - `[String]`
  - `[[String]]`
  - `Int`
  - `[Int]`
