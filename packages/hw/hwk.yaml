  # hwk ![MIT licensed](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

  <img align="right" alt="hwk" src="hwk.png" />

  **hwk** (pronounced "hawk") is a simple Haskell-based text processing commandline tool, somewhat similar to tools like **awk**, **grep**, **sed**.
  `hwk` applies composed pure Haskell functions to a list of strings from stdin, enabling text processing without having to remember an obscure DSL or cli options. This tool can also help to encourage people to think functionally.

  hwk was originally written by Lukas Martinelli in 2016-2017:
  see the [original README file](README.md.orig).

  **hwk** is pretty similar to [**Hawk**](https://github.com/gelisam/hawk),
  so you may also want to try that for a different more sophisticated monadic
  implementation. Some of main differences are:

  - hwk uses String for input for type simplicity, whereas hawk uses ByteString
  - hawk has special options for controlling input and output delimiters, whereas in hwk everything is roughly just `[String] -> [String]` (more details below)
  - by default hwk applies a function to the list of all the lines of stdin: `hwk -l` corresponds to `hawk -m` and `hawk -a` to `hwk`.

  ## Example
  Some simple use-cases are in the [examples](examples/) directory.

  Change and append a string to each line:
  ```bash
  $ seq 0 2 | hwk --line '(++ ".txt") . show . (+1) . int'
  1.txt
  2.txt
  3.txt
  ```
  or without line-mode: `hwk 'map ((++ ".txt") . show . (+1) . int)'`.

  Sum all negative numbers:
  ```bash
  $ seq -100 100 | hwk 'sum . filter (< 0) . ints'
  -5050
  ```
  The ints function transforms a list of strings into a list of ints

  Factorials in your shell scripts!:
  ```bash
  seq 10 12 | hwk --line 'let {fact 0 = 1; fact n = n * fact (n - 1)} in fact . int'
  3628800
  39916800
  479001600
  ```

  Extract data from a file:
  ```bash
  $ cat /etc/passwd | hwk -l 'reverse . filter (/= "x") . take 3 . splitOn ":"' | head -3
  0 root
  1 bin
  2 daemon
  ```
  (uses `splitOn` from the extra library; `-l` is the short form of `--line`).

  The argument passed to `hwk` must be a valid Haskell function: a function that takes a list of strings and returns a new list or a single value.

  Check whether the input contains a certain string:
  ```
  $ cat /etc/passwd | hwk --all 'bool "no" "yes" . isInfixOf "1000"'
  yes
  ```

  ## Configuration
  `hwk` uses a Haskell configuration file `~/.config/hwk/Hwk.hs` which provides the context for the hint evaluation of the supplied function. Hint (ghci) also checks the current directory when loading so one can also override the configuration on a directory basis.

  The default [Hwk module](data/Hwk.hs) configuration imports
  `Prelude`, `Data.List`, `Data.Char`, and `System.FilePath`
  into the hint interpreter.

  The first time hwk is run it sets up `~/.config/hwk/Hwk.hs`.

  You can add other modules to import or define your own functions in
  `~/.config/hwk/Hwk.hs`.

  After a hwk version update you may wish or have to update up your Hwk.hs file to take account of new changes: a copy of the latest default Hwk.hs is also put in `~/.config/hwk/` with the version suffix.

  ## Install
  Either use the `install.sh` script, or install by cabal-install or stack
  as described below:

  ### Install script from source tree or git
  Use `stack unpack hwk` or `git clone https://github.com/juhp/hwk`.

  Then go to the source directory and run the `install.sh` script, which

  - first runs `stack install`
  - then moves the binary installed by `stack install` to `~/.local/lib/hwk`, and sets up a wrapper script `~/.local/bin/hwk` which runs it.

  You may wish to change the resolver in stack.yaml first: it is also used to determine the resolver used by the created `hwk` wrapper script.

  ### cabal
  If you are on a Linux distro with a system installed ghc and Haskell libaries,
  you can install with `cabal install` to make use of them.

  ### stack
  Installing by stack is better if you do not have a system ghc
  and/or global system Haskell libraries installed.

  Alternatively to install by hand: run `stack install`,
  and then run it with `stack exec hwk ...` using the same resolver.

  ## How does `hwk` work?

  - `hwk` use the hint library to evaluate haskell functions on standard input.
  - By default it splits the input to a list of lines and applies the function to them
  - Use `-a` or `--all` to apply a function to all the input,
    or `-l`/`--line` to map the function on each line separately.
  - You can only typecheck the function or an expr with `-t`/`--typecheck`
    or evaluate an expr with `-e`/`--eval`.

  ## Supported return types

  The following return values are supported:

  - `String`
  - `[String]`
  - `[[String]]`
  - `Int`
  - `[Int]`
  - `[[Int]]`
