  # hw-rankselect-base
  [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/haskell-works/hw-rankselect-base.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/haskell-works/hw-rankselect-base)

  Rank and select operations.

  This library will use support for some BMI2 CPU instructions on some x86 based
  CPUs if compiled with the appropriate flags on `ghc-8.4.1` or later.

  ## Rank and select

  This library provides the following functions on various types:

  * `rank1`
  * `rank0`
  * `select1`
  * `select0`

  Type class instances are provided for the following primitive types:

  * `Bool`
  * `Word8`
  * `Word16`
  * `Word32`
  * `Word64`

  Moreover additional type class instances are provided for `[]`, `Vector`
  from both `Data.Vector`, and `Data.Vector.Storable` of these primitive
  types.

  The collection-based type classes instances are not intended to be used
  in high-performance code because they have poor performance for most
  purposes and are provided purely as reference implementations.

  Bit-vectors larger than 64-bits need indexing to achieve higher performance.
  A indexed bit-vector implementation can found in the
  [hw-rankselect](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hw-rankselect) package.

  ## Notes

  This library follows standard 1-based counting conventions typically found in
  Computer Science literature where `select1 10 2 = 4` as illustrated here:

  ```text
    8 7 6 5  [4]3 2 1
    0 0 0 0   1 0 1 0
  ```

  The standard convention for the `bmi2` implementation, comes at a small cost.

  An internal function `select1Word64Bmi2Base0` demonstrates 0-based counting
  that is slightly faster when implemented with the `bmi2` instruction set where
  `select1 10 1 = 3` as illustrated here:

  ```text
    7 6 5 4  [3]2 1 0
    0 0 0 0   1 0 1 0
  ```

  ## Compilation

  It is sufficient to build, test and benchmark the library as follows
  for emulated behaviour:

  ```text
  stack build
  stack test
  stack bench
  ```

  To target the BMI2 instruction set, add the `bmi2` flag:

  ```text
  stack build --flag bits-extra:bmi2 --flag hw-rankselect-base:bmi2
  stack test  --flag bits-extra:bmi2 --flag hw-rankselect-base:bmi2
  stack bench --flag bits-extra:bmi2 --flag hw-rankselect-base:bmi2
  ```

  ## Benchmark results

  The following benchmark shows the kinds of performance gain that can
  be expected from enabling the BMI2 instruction set for CPU targets
  that support them:
