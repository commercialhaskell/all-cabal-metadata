  # lsfrom

  `lsfrom` lists the files and dirs in a directory starting from the first one
  that matches the given filename prefix or the first filename after that
  if there is no match, using the current locale collation order.

  ```
  $ ls
  A a B C
  $ lsfrom a
  a
  B
  C
  $ lsfrom a/
  B
  C
  $ lsfrom /sy
  /sys
  /sysroot
  /tmp
  /usr
  /var
  ```

  This may be useful for continuing a script on the content of a directory
  after a failure, etc:

  ```shellsession
  $ myscript.sh $(lsfrom next)
  ```

  ## Requirements

  It uses system `ls` order to preserve locale collation
  and requires ls with the `-A` option to exclude `.` and `..` (eg coreutils).
  It has been tested on Linux.

  ## Installation

  `stack install lsfrom` or `cabal install lsfrom`.
