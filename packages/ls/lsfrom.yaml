  # lsfrom

  `lsfrom` lists files in the current directory that start with a
  particular sequence of characters and those after it with respect to
  collation.

  ```
  $ ls
  A a B C
  $ lsfrom a/
  B
  C
  $ lsfrom /sy
  /sys
  /sysroot
  /tmp
  /usr
  /var
  ```

  This may be useful for continuing a script on the files in a dir
  after a failure, etc.
