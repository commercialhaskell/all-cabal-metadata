description: "# lsh\r\n A simple ls clone with modern, colored fomatting. Made in
  haskell.\r\n If you want me to add a feature, please add a feature request. Same
  goes for bug reports/other issues\r\n - [Configuring]()\r\n - [FAQ]()\r\n# FAQ\r\n
  ### Icons do not display correclty\r\nThis may be due to two reasons:\r\n- Your
  terminal renders the icons differently. Then, the best you can do is replace the
  icons to the ones that do render correctly. Use [the nerd font cheat sheet](https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet)
  to choose icons for yourself\r\n- Your terminal cannot render unicode. On unix the
  fix is distro-dependant, but on windows you can try:\r\n    - install [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)
  (also available in Microsoft Store)\r\n    - changing your codepage with `chcp 65001`
  ([guide on how to make this permanent](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7432545/change-codepage-in-cmd-permanently))\r\n\r\n**!
  Important:**\r\n**icons *require* a nerd font to be installed within the terminal
  you are using**\r\n\r\n### How do i disable the icons?\r\nTo disable the icons,
  you need to write a string of exactly one space in all of the `iconConfig` fields
  in `Config.hs`, while apllying any of the `Colors.hs` functions to that space\r\n\r\n#
  Configuring\r\n### Icons\r\nfor icons to work, you need to configure three variables
  in `Config.hs`: `fileIcon`, `directoryIcon` and `iconConfig`. Icons are represented
  as one character long unicode strings with a coloring function applied.\r\n - `fileIcon`
  is the icon to be displayed on extensionless files / file extensions without the
  icon set\r\n - `directoryIcon` is the icon that will be displyed on directories\r\n
  - `iconConfig` is a hashmap (`Extension => Icon`) where the keys are the extensions
  and the values are the icons. If you want to add another extension, just add another
  tuple with the extension as the first value (starting with a dot) and the icon as
  the second one. **You must apply exactly one function from `Colors.hs` to the icon
  literal, otherwise the fomatting will break. If you want a white icon, use `white`
  or `bwhite`**"
