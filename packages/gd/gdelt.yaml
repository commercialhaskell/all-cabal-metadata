description: "# gdelt\n\nParsers for GDELT (Global Database of Events, Language, and
  Tone) V2. \n\nGDELT is an initiative to construct a catalog of human societal-scale
  behavior and beliefs across all countries of the world, connecting every person,
  organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event across the planet into
  a single massive network that captures what's happening around the world, what its
  context is and who's involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single
  day.\n\nGDELT website : https://www.gdeltproject.org/\n\nGDELT raw data : \n\n  *
