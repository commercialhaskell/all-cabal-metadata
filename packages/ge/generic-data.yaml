synopsis: Deriving instances with GHC.Generics and related utilities
changelog: |
  # 0.9.2.1

  - No external changes.
  - Use cabal-docspec instead of doctest

  # 0.9.2.0

  - Add instance of `Bounded` for `FiniteEnumeration` (the same as `Generically`)

  # 0.9.1.0

  - Fix `conIdToString` (it was completely broken)
  - Add `conIdMin` and `conIdMax` representing the leftmost and rightmost
    constructors of a data type.
  - Add `NonEmptyType` and `IsEmptyType` to express the constraint that
    a generic type must or must not be empty.
  - Reexport `Generic` and `Generic1` for convenience.

  # 0.9.0.0

  - Improved definition of `gfoldMap`, `gtraverse`, and `sequenceA`.
    The optimized Core of `Traversable` instances eliminates all `GHC.Generic` instance
    boilerplate. In many cases, it is identical to the result of GHC's `DeriveFoldable`
    and `DeriveTraversable` extensions (note: this was already not a problem for
    `gfmap`).

    It's worth noting that there are currently issues with inlining which prevent
    optimizations that *generic-data* would ideally rely on.

      + The biggest issue is that GHC will not even inline the `to` and `from`
        methods of the `Generic` instance it derives for large types (this shows
        up at around 5 constructors and 10 fields, which is indeed not really
        big). This will be fixed by a patch for GHC (WIP):
        https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/merge_requests/2965

      + There appear to be some more inlining issues beyond that (issue #40).

  # 0.8.3.0

  - Add generic `Read`. Thanks to RyanGlScott.

  # 0.8.2.0

  - Add microsurgery `CopyRep`.
  - Improve documentation of `Microsurgery` module.
  - Fix a bug where `gshowsPrec` would incorrectly display prefix uses of
    symbol data constructors or record selectors (e.g., `data R = (:!:) Int Int`
    or `data S = MkS { (##) :: Int -> Int }`). Thanks to RyanGlScott.
  - Fix a bug where `gshowsPrec` would incorrectly display infix uses of
    alphanumeric data constructors (e.g., ```data T = Int `MkT` Int```).
    Thanks to RyanGlScott.

  # 0.8.1.0

  - Add `Old` type family mapping newtypes to their underlying type.

  # 0.8.0.0

  - Add `GenericProduct`, for deriving `via GenericProduct B` when `B` is not the
    type `A` you want the derived instance for.
    Note this used to be `Generically`'s behavior for `Monoid` before 0.7.0.0.
  - Add generic implementations for `Ix`. Thanks to Topsii.

  - Add `conIdNamed`, to get a `ConId` by its type-level name
  - Add instance `Show (ConId a)`
  - Improve type errors for deriving `Semigroup` and `Monoid` via `Generically`.
    Thanks to yairchu.

  # 0.7.0.0

  - Change `Monoid` instance for `Generically`, to be compatible with users'
    non-generic instances of `Semigroup`. Thanks to yairchu.
  - Add `gcoerce`, `gcoerceBinop`.

  # 0.6.0.1

  - Fix derivation of `Show1` for `(:.:)`

  # 0.6.0.0

  - Add `Surgery` newtype for DerivingVia
  - `Derecordify`, `Typeage`, `RenameFields`, `RenameConstrs`, `OnFields`
    are no longer type families, but defunctionalized symbols
    to be applied using `GSurgery`.

  # 0.5.0.0

  - Specialize `onData` to `Data`
  - Add some instances for `U1` and `V1` in `Microsurgery`
  - Add `OnFields` and `DOnFields` surgeries ("higher-kindification")

  # 0.4.0.0

  - Created `Microsurgery` module. Initial set of surgeries:

      + `Derecordify`
      + `Typeage`
      + `RenameFields`, `RenameConstrs`
      + Some doc about using generic-lens for surgeries

  # 0.3.0.0

  - Add generic implementations of `enumFrom`, `enumFromThen`, `enumFromTo`,
    `enumFromThenTo`. They are actually required to be explicit for correct
    `Enum` instances. Thanks to Topsii.
  - Parameterize `GEnum` by a type-level option, and add `FiniteEnum` option
    to allow `Enum` to be derived for composite types. Thanks to Topsii.

  # 0.2.0.0

  - Remove `Generic.Data.Types.Map`
  - Add `Generic.Data.Data.Types.toData` and `fromData`
  - Remove `Defun` module (subsumed by `first-class-families` package)

  # 0.1.1.0

  - Add `gconIndex`
  - Interface for constructor tags
  - Type-level `Meta` accessors
  - Add basic `Newtype` functions

  # 0.1.0.0

  # Generic data types in Haskell [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/generic-data.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-data) [![GitHub CI](https://github.com/Lysxia/generic-data/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Lysxia/generic-data/actions)

  Utilities for `GHC.Generics`.

  ## Generic deriving for standard classes

  ### Example: generically deriving Semigroup instances for products

  Semi-automatic method using `gmappend`

  ```haskell
  data Foo a = Bar [a] [a] deriving Generic

  instance Semigroup (Foo a) where
    (<>) = gmappend
  ```

  This library also synergizes with the `DerivingVia` extension
  (introduced in GHC 8.6), thanks to the `Generically` newtype.

  ```haskell
  data Foo a = Bar [a] [a]
    deriving Generic
    deriving Semigroup via (Generically (Foo a))
  ```

  These examples can be found in `test/example.hs`.

  ---

  Note for completeness, the first example uses the following extensions and
  imports:

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}

  -- base
  import Data.Semigroup (Semigroup(..))

  -- generic-data
  import Generic.Data (Generic, gmappend)
  import Generic.Data.Orphans ()
  ```

  The second example makes these additions on top:

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE
      DerivingStrategies,
      DerivingVia #-}  -- since GHC 8.6.1

  -- In addition to the previous imports
  import Generic.Data (Generically(..))
  ```

  ### Supported classes

  Supported classes that GHC currently can't derive: `Semigroup`, `Monoid`,
  `Applicative`, `Alternative`, `Eq1`, `Ord1`, `Show1`.

  Other classes from base are also supported, even though GHC can already derive
  them:

  - `Eq`, `Ord`, `Enum`, `Bounded`, `Show`, `Read` (derivable by the standard);
  - `Functor`, `Foldable`, `Traversable` (derivable via extensions,
    `DeriveFunctor`, etc.).

  To derive type classes outside of the standard library, it might be worth
  taking a look at [one-liner](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/one-liner).

  ## Type metadata

  Extract type names, constructor names, number and arities of constructors, etc..

  ## Type surgery

  generic-data offers simple operations (microsurgeries) on generic
  representations.

  More surgeries can be found in
  [generic-data-surgery](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-data-surgery),
  and suprisingly, in
  [generic-lens](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-lens) and
  [one-liner](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/one-liner).

  For more details, see also:

  - the module `Generic.Data.Microsurgery`;

  - the files `test/lens-surgery.hs` and `one-liner-surgery.hs`.

  ### Surgery example

  Derive an instance of `Show` generically for a record type,
  but as if it were not a record.

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}
  import Generic.Data (Generic, gshowsPrec)
  import Generic.Data.Microsurgery (toData, derecordify)

  -- An example record type
  newtype T = T { unT :: Int } deriving Generic

  -- Naively deriving Show would result in this being shown:
  --
  -- show (T 3) = "T {unT = 3}"
  --
  -- But instead, with a simple surgery, unrecordify, we can forget T was
  -- declared as a record:
  --
  -- show (T 3) = "T 3"

  instance Show T where
    showsPrec n = gshowsPrec n . derecordify . toData

  -- This example can be found in test/microsurgery.hs
  ```

  Alternatively, using `DerivingVia`:

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric, DerivingVia #-}
  import Generic.Data (Generic)  -- Reexported from GHC.Generics

  -- Constructors must be visible to use DerivingVia
  import Generic.Data.Microsurgery (Surgery, Surgery'(..), Generically(..), Derecordify)

  data V = V { v1 :: Int, v2 :: Int }
    deriving Generic
    deriving Show via (Surgery Derecordify V)

  -- show (V {v1 = 3, v2 = 4}) = "V 3 4"
  ```

  ## Related links

  generic-data aims to subsume generic deriving features of the following
  packages:

  - [semigroups](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/semigroups): generic
    `Semigroup`, `Monoid`, but with a heavier dependency footprint.
  - [transformers-compat](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers-compat):
    generic `Eq1`, `Ord1`, `Show1`.
  - [generic-deriving](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-deriving):
    doesn't derive the classes in base (defines clones of these classes as a toy
    example); has Template Haskell code to derive `Generic` (not in generic-data).
