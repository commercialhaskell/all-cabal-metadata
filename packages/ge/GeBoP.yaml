changelog: "\n2015-09-23\n\nVersion 1.7.5\n - Game.hs: changed call to \"update\"
  in \"Game.update\" to avoid confusion\n   with the recently introduced \"update\"
  in wxHaskell\n \n \n2015-01-29\n\nVersion 1.7.4.1\n Changes in .cabal file\n  -
  Removed upper limits for versions of Haskell Platform packages (except base)\n  -
  Added address of repository\n  - Removed lower limit for wxcore, as the wxcore version
  is defined by wx\n  - Added \"Default-language: Haskell2010\"\n Other changes\n
  \ - Added FlexibleContexts pragma to GUI.hs, to satisfy GHC 7.10\n  - Removed Byte
  Order Mark from GUI.hs, to satisfy GHC 7.10\n \n \n2014-08-13\n\nVersion 1.7.4\n
  - The version info is read from the .cabal file.\n - Removed upper limits for wx
  and wxcore version\n\n\n2013-09-20\n\nVersion 1.7.3\n - Adapted to Haskell Platform
  2013.2.0.0, wxWidgets 2.9.5 and\n   wxHaskell 0.90.1.0. Amongst others, hierarchical
  module system\n   introduced. GUI.hs: staticBitmapCreate has now 0x00200000\n   (==
  wxBORDER_NONE) as style, as wxWidgets does not accept -1 as style\n   anymore. The
  clientsize of the \"move now\" button is not set anymore,\n   so the text fits.
  TicTacToe now repaints on resize\n\n\n2010-10-20\n\nVersion 1.7.2\n - Increased
  the maximum version of base to < 5 .\n\n\n2009-11-14 \n\nVersion 1.7.1\n - Added
  -Wall flag in the CABAL file \n - Solved all compiler warnings.\n - Increased the
  maximum version of wx and wxcore to < 0.13 .\n - Added the file changelog.txt\n\n\n2009-10-29
  \n\nVersion 1.7\n - Adapted to wxWidgets 2.8.9 / wxHaskell 0.11.1.2 \n - Cabalized\n\n"

description: "\uFEFF-----------------------\n-- GeBoP version 1.7 --\n-----------------------\n\nThis
  is the readme.txt file that comes with the source code of GeBoP, version 1.7. This
  source consists of the following files:\n\n* 16 Haskell source code files\n*  2
  Icon files\n*    This readme file\n* 52 Bitmap images in a directory called 'images'\n*
  20 HTML files and a bitmap in a directory called 'help'\n\n------------------------------------\n--
  meaning of the various modules --\n------------------------------------\n\n* Game\nGeBoP
  works with a class Game, which is defined in the module Game. This class describes
  the general properties a boardgame should have. The Game module also includes the
  concept of a game tree, and a general algorithm to traverse this tree in order to
  find sensible moves.\n\n* Ataxx, Bamp, Halma, Hex, Kram, Nim, Reversi, TicTacToe,
  and Zenix\nThese are the implemented games. Each of these modules contains an instance
  of the Game class.\n\n* GUI\nGUI is the module that contains the GUI itself. \n\n*
  Tools\nThis module is just an unstructured bunch of functions I use in other modules
  :).\n\n* HSL\nThis module implements the HSL color model.\n\n* Inf\nThis module
  defines the set of integers including two extra values <+infinity> and <-infinity>\n\n*
  Main\nMain just imports the games and starts the GUI.\n\n* Setup\nThe program used
  by cabal-install to install GeBoP\n\n\n--------------------------\n-- state of the
  program --\n--------------------------\n\nVersion 1.7 of GeBoP is a nice and complete
  version. However, I could still do some work on the algorithms for playing the computer
  uses, and some of the games use rather naïve evaluation functions at the moment.
  I plan to do this some time in the near or otherwise far future.\n\nSince you are
  reading this file, you are probably a Haskell programmer. If you feel like implementing
  your favorite game for GeBoP, please go ahead and mail it to me when you're done
  :)\n\n--------\n-- me --\n--------\n\nMy name is Maarten Löffler. I am currently
  a researcher at Utrecht University. \n\nI wrote GeBoP in my free time, because I
  like games and I like Haskell. When wxHaskell came to be, it became even more fun
  because of the nice graphical effects :)\n\nwebsite at http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~loffl001\nemail
