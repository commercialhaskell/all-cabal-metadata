  # Generic functors [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/generic-functor.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-functor) [![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/lysxia/generic-functor/badges/main/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/lysxia/generic-functor/-/commits/main)

  Implementation of `Functor` instances and other functor-like structures
  using `GHC.Generics`.

  ## Deriving `Functor`

  This library enables `DerivingVia` to derive the `Functor` class generically,
  via the newtype `GenericFunctor`.

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric, DerivingVia #-}

  import GHC.Generics (Generic)
  import Generic.Functor (GenericFunctor(..))

  data Twice a = Twice (Either a a)
    deriving Generic
    deriving Functor via (GenericFunctor Twice)
  ```

  Note that there is already built-in support for deriving `Functor` in GHC with the
  `DeriveFunctor` extension instead. If that extension ever chokes on a type, this
  library might have a chance at handling it. (Open an issue if it does not!)

  The `Twice` example just above is not handled by the `DeriveFunctor` extension:

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE DeriveFunctor #-}

  data Twice a = Twice (Either a a) deriving Functor

  {-
    error:
      • Can't make a derived instance of ‘Functor Twice’:
          Constructor ‘Twice’ must use the type variable only as the last argument of a data type
  -}
  ```

  The [*generic-data*][generic-data] library also includes a generic implementation of `Functor`,
  but only for instances of `Generic1`, which applies to much more restricted shapes
  of `data` than `Generic`.

  ## Deriving `Bifunctor`

  Similarly, we can use `DerivingVia` for the `Bifunctor` class
  (from *base*, module `Data.Bifunctor`).

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric, DerivingVia #-}

  import GHC.Generics (Generic)
  import Generic.Functor (GenericFunctor(..), GenericBifunctor(..))

  data Tree a b = Node a (Tree a b) (Tree a b) | Leaf b
    deriving Generic
    deriving Functor via (GenericFunctor (Tree a))
    deriving Bifunctor via (GenericBifunctor Tree)
  ```

  In summary, the newtype `GenericFunctor` can be used for `DerivingVia`
  of the classes `Functor` and `Foldable`, and the newtype `GenericBifunctor`
  for the classes `Bifunctor` and `Bifoldable`.

  Default implementations for the above classes are also available as standalone
  functions (`gfmap`, `gfoldMap`, `gbimap`, `gbifoldMap`) and also for
  `Traversable` and `Bitraversable` (`gtraverse`, `gbitraverse`).

  ## Functors not over the last type parameter

  The standard `Functor` class only applies to types that are functors over their
  last type parameter. For example, in `Either e r`, `fmap` maps only `r`.

  Using this library, `fmap`-like functions can be derived over any type
  parameter of a `Generic` data type, all from the same definition `gsolomap`.

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}

  import GHC.Generics (Generic)
  import Generic.Functor.Multimap (gsolomap)

  data Result a r = Error a | Ok r   -- Another name for Either
    deriving Generic

  mapError :: (a -> b) -> Result a r -> Result b r
  mapError = gsolomap

  -- This one is fmap
  mapOk :: (a -> b) -> Result e a -> Result e b
  mapOk = gsolomap

  mapBoth :: (a -> b) -> Result a a -> Result b b
  mapBoth = gsolomap
  ```

  `gsolomap` is **unsafe**. Misuse will break your program.
  Read on for specifics.

  ### Usage

  `gsolomap` should only be used to define **polymorphic** "`fmap`-like functions"
  for `Generic` types.

  The signature of `gsolomap` is:

  ```haskell
  gsolomap :: (Generic x, Generic y, GSolomap a b x y) => (a -> b) -> (x -> y)
  ```

  The types `x` and `y` must be specializations of the same user-defined `data`
  type which is an instance of `Generic`, with some type parameters equal to `a`
  or `b` respectively. At use sites of `gsolomap`, `a` and `b` must also be two
  distinct universally quantified type variables, with no equality constraint
  relating them with each other or any other type.

  The guarantee is that `gsolomap` satisfies `gsolomap id = id`. Under the
  condition that `a` and `b` are abstract, that equation uniquely determines the
  implementation. (That uniqueness claim may be broken with GADTs and other
  explicit uses of type equality constraints.)

  In particular, `gsolomap` *must not* be specialized with types `a` and `b` that
  are equal. A function defined using `gsolomap` is safe to specialize once
  the `GSolomap` constraint has been discharged.

  For instance the three functions above, `mapError`, `mapOk`, `mapBoth` are
  sufficiently polymorphic.
  They are each uniquely determined by their types and the equation `mapX id = id`.
  (Without that equation, `mapBoth` has four implementations of the same type.)

  ## Compositions of functors

  How many `fmap` do you need to map a function `a -> b` over
  `(t, Maybe [Either Bool a])`?

  You only need one `solomap`:

  ```haskell
  type F t a = (t, Maybe [Either Bool a])

  maps :: (a -> b) -> F t a -> F t b
  maps = solomap
  ```

  `solomap` can also see through bifunctors and there may be more than
  one occurrence of the type parameter `a`.

  ```haskell
  type F a = ([a], Either a ())

  maps2 :: (a -> b) -> F a -> F b
  maps2 = solomap
  ```

  `solomap` is **unsafe**, subject to the same restrictions as `gsolomap`:
  where `solomap` is used, the type of its first argument `(a -> b)` must refer
  to two distinct universally quantified variables `a` and `b`.
  Functions are safe to specialize only once the `Solomap` constraint is out of
  their contexts.

  ```haskell
  solomap :: Solomap a b x y => (a -> b) -> (x -> y)
  ```

  ## Functors of multiple parameters

  You can also map with more than one function simultaneously.
  For example with `a -> b` and `c -> d` over `(Maybe a, [(c, a)])`:

  ```haskell
  type F a c = (Maybe a, [(c, a)])

  bimaps :: (a -> b) -> (c -> d) -> F a c -> F b d
  bimaps f g = multimap (f :+ g :+ ())
  ```

  `multimap` takes a list of functions separated by `(:+)` and terminated by `()`.

  There is also a `gmultimap`, generalizing `gsolomap`.

  `gmultimap` and `multimap` are **unsafe**, similarly to `gsolomap` and `solomap`.

  The public API is `Generic.Functor`. Don't use `Generic.Functor.Internal`.
