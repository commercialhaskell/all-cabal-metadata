synopsis: Generically newtype to use with DerivingVia
changelog: |
  # 0.1.1 -- 2023-03-10

  * Backport `Eq` and `Ord` instances for `Generically1`, which were introduced
    in `base-4.18.0.0`. To ensure that these instances are in scope when building
    with `base-4.17.0.0` (in which `Generically1` is defined in `base`, not this
    library), we also add a dependency on `base-orphans`.

  # 0.1 -- 2022-06-15

  * First version.
