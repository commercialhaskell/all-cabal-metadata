  ## Executive Summary

  This library is inspired very heavily by the
  [gemini-server](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gemini-server)
  package, but does not need to be linked against OpenSSL. Instead, it
  uses [tcp-streams](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tcp-streams) to
  provide TLS functionality.

  ## Pull Requests

  Pull requests welcome.  That said, please make your pull requests to
  the `dev` branch.
