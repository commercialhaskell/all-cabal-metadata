  ## Important Note

  This project is not yet ready for release. Everything within it should
  be considered unstable and subject to change at any time.

  ## Executive Summary

  This library is inspired very heavily by the
  [gemini-server](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gemini-server)
  package, but does not need to be linked against OpenSSL. Instead, it
  uses [tcp-streams](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tcp-streams) to
  provide TLS functionality.
