  # generic-enumeration

  This is a library that provides generics-based enumeration of all possible
  values for a type.

  It differs from `deriving Enum` in that:

  * It supports non-nullary data constructors.
  * It does not try for integer encoding/decoding. It works by providing a
    list containing every value, and also providing `succMay` and `predMay`
    analogs to Enum's `succ` and `pred`
  * It does not allow user-defined instances. Instances either work generically or they don't.

  Because of this it is a little less powerful that `Enum` in some cases,
  but it is also a lot more safe. There are no partial functions, and
  disallowing user-defined instances means that not even a human can mess
  it up.


  ## Use case

  I wrote this to solve a particular kind of problem I often have. When I have a
  type:

  ```Haskell
  data A
    = A1
    | A2
    | A3
    deriving (Enum, Bounded)
  ```

  And I want to produce a list of all the values:

  ```Haskell
  allAs :: [A]
  allAs = [minBound .. maxBound]
  ```

  This `deriving (Enum, Bounded)` and `[minBound .. maxBound]` dance is
  a little awkward, and it is not always the case `Enum` or `Bounded` is
  meaningful for the type except as an implementation detail for getting
  the full list of values. Worse, this doesn't even work for types with
  non-nullary constructors. E.g. this won't compile:

  ```Haskell
  data A
    = A1 B
    | A2 C
    | A3
    deriving (Enum, Bounded)

  data B
    = B1
    | B2
    deriving (Enum, Bounded)

  data C
    = C1
    | C2
    deriving (Enum, Bounded)
  ```

  On the other hand, this will compile just fine:

  ```Haskell
  data A
    = A1 B
    | A2 C
    | A3
    deriving (Generic)

  data B
    = B1
    | B2
    deriving (Generic)

  data C
    = C1
    | C2
    deriving (Generic)

  allAs :: [A]
  allAs = enumeration
    -- where `enumeration` is a function from this package.
    -- Has the value `[A1 B1, A1 B2, A2 C1, A2 C2, A3]`
  ```
