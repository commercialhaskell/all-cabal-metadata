  is a small Haskell persistence layer for relational databases. \nThe approach relies
  on [GHC.Generics](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.17.0.0/docs/GHC-Generics.html).
  The actual database access is provided by the [HDBC](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/HDBC)
  library.\n\nThe *functional goal* of the persistence layer is to provide hassle-free
  RDBMS persistence for Haskell data types in \nRecord notation (for simplicity I
  call these *Entities*).\n\nIt therefore provides means for inserting, updating,
  deleting and querying such entities into/from relational databases.\n\nThe main
  *design goal* is to minimize the *boilerplate* code required:\n\n- no manual instantiation
  of type classes\n- no implementation of encoders/decoders\n- no special naming convention
  for types and their attributes \n- no special types to define entities and attributes\n-
  no Template Haskell scaffolding of glue code\n\nIn an ideal world we would be able
  to take any POHO (Plain old Haskell Object) \nand persist it to any RDBMS without
  any additional effort.\n\n## Status\n\nAs of now there is full support for SQLite
  and PostgreSQL. \nSupport for other databases will be implemented on demand.\n\n###
  new features in v0.6\n- Autoincrement flag for primary keys can now defined per
  Entity\n- insert now always returns the inserted entity (thus insertReturning was
  removed)\n- insertMany now also respects handling of primary keys\n\n### new features
  in v0.5\n\n- support for PostgreSQL\n- support RETURNING statement for insert\n-
  support for auto-incrementing primary keys\n- entitiesFromRows now available in
  GP api also\n- provide a simple quasi-qoter for defining sql queries\n- expose some
  HDBC functions in the GP API\n- explicit setting of transaction mode\n\n\nFeature
  requests, feedback and pull requests are welcome!\n\n## Available on Hackage\n\n[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-persistence](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-persistence)\n\nAdd
  the following to your `package.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n- generic-persistence\n```\n\nI
  would also recommend to add the setting `language: GHC2021`  to your `package.yaml`
  file:\n\n```yaml\nlanguage: GHC2021\n```\n\nThis drastically reduces the amount
  of LANGUAGE extensions that need to be added to your source files.\n\n\n## Short
  demo\n\nHere now follows a short demo that shows how the library looks and feels
  from the user's point of view.\n\n```haskell\n{-# LANGUAGE DeriveAnyClass #-} --
  allows automatic derivation from Entity type class\n\nmodule Main (main) where\n\nimport
  \          Database.GP          \nimport           Database.HDBC.Sqlite3 (connectSqlite3)\nimport
  \          GHC.Generics\n\n-- | An Entity data type with several fields, using record
  syntax.\ndata Person = Person\n  { personID :: Int,\n    name     :: String,\n    age
  \     :: Int,\n    address  :: String\n  }\n  deriving (Generic, Entity, Show) --
  deriving Entity allows us to use the GenericPersistence API\n\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain
  = do\n  -- connect to a database in auto commit mode\n  conn <- connect AutoCommit
  <$> connectSqlite3 \"sqlite.db\"\n\n  -- initialize Person table\n  setupTableFor
  @Person SQLite conn\n\n  alice <- insert conn Person {name = \"Alice\", age = 25,
  address = \"Elmstreet 1\"}\n  print alice\n\n  -- update a Person\n  update conn
  alice {address = \"Main Street 200\"}\n\n  -- select a Person by id\n  -- The result
  type must be provided by the call site,\n  -- as `selectById` has a polymorphic
  return type `IO (Maybe a)`.\n  alice' <- selectById @Person conn (personID alice)\n
  \ print alice'\n\n  -- select all Persons from a database. again, the result type
  must be provided.\n  allPersons <- select @Person conn allEntries\n  print allPersons\n\n
  \ -- select all Persons from a database, where age is smaller 30.\n  allPersonsUnder30
  <- select @Person conn (field \"age\" <. (30 :: Int))\n  print allPersonsUnder30\n\n
  \ -- delete a Person from a database\n  delete conn alice\n\n  -- select all Persons
  from a database. Now it should be empty.\n  allPersons' <- select @Person conn allEntries\n
  \ print allPersons'\n\n  -- close connection\n  disconnect conn\n```\n\n## Deal
  with runtime exceptions or use total functions? Your choice!\n\nGenericPersistence
  provides two different APIs for accessing the database:\n- the default API (as shown
  in the above demo), which uses exceptions to signal errors\n- the safe API, which
  uses `Either` to signal errors\n\n### Exceptions in the default API\nThe default
  API is the easiest to use, but you will have to do exception handling to catch runtime
  errors. To use it you'll have to import the `Database.GP` module:\n\n```haskell\nimport
  Database.GP \n```\n\nThese are the exceptions that can be thrown:\n\n```haskell\ndata
  PersistenceException =\n    EntityNotFound String\n  | DuplicateInsert String\n
  \ | DatabaseError String\n  | NoUniqueKey String\n  deriving (Show, Eq, Exception)\n```\n\nThe
  `EntityNotFound` exception is thrown when you try to select an entity by its primary
  key, but no entity with the given primary key exists in the database.\n\nThe `DuplicateInsert`
  exception is thrown when you try to insert an entity into the database, but an entity
  with the same primary key already exists in the database.\n\nThe `DatabaseError`
  exception is thrown when the database backend returns an error.\n\nThe `NoUniqueKey`
  exception is thrown when you try to select an entity by its primary key, but multiple
  rows are returned by the database. This can happen if there is no primary key constraint
  defined on the underlying database column.\n\nA real world example can be found
  in the [Servant GP - UserServer](https://github.com/thma/servant-gp/blob/main/src/UserServer.hs)
  module.\n\n### Total functions in the safe API\n\nThe safe API is a bit more verbose,
  but it does not throw exceptions. To use it you'll have to import the `Database.GP.GenericPersistenceSafe`
  module:\n\n```haskell\nimport Database.GP.GenericPersistenceSafe\n```\n\nThis module
  provides the same function as `Database.GP`, but all functions return `Either PersistenceException
  a` instead of `IO a` or `IO (Maybe a)`.\n\n```haskell\neitherExRes <- selectById
  conn \"1\" :: IO (Either PersistenceException Person)\ncase eitherExRes of\n  Left
  (EntityNotFound _) -> print \"Entity not found\"\n  Right person            -> print
  person\n```\n\nThis may look a bit verbose, but in actual code this may work out
  better, as `Either` allows pattern matching and chaining of computations with the
  `do` notation.\n\nA real world example can be found in the [Servant GP - UserServerSafe](https://github.com/thma/servant-gp/blob/main/src/UserServerSafe.hs)
  module. The `UserServerSafe` module is a copy of the `UserServer` module, but it
  uses the safe API instead of the default API. As you can see, the code of `UserServerSafe`
  is actually a bit more compact than the code of UserServer. (In the default API,
  we have to deal with the special case of `selectById` returning `Nothing`.)\n\n##
  How it works\n\nIn order to store Haskell data types in a relational database, we
  need to define a mapping between Haskell types and database tables.\nThis mapping
  is defined by the `Entity` type class. This type class comes with default implementations
  for all methods which define \nthe standard behaviour. (The default implementations
  internally use `GHC.Generics`.)\n\nThis default mapping will work for many cases,
  but it can be customized by overriding the default implementations.\n\n### The Entity
  type class\n\nThe `Entity` type class specifies the following methods:\n\n```haskell\nclass
  (Generic a, HasConstructor (Rep a), HasSelectors (Rep a)) => Entity a where\n  --
  | Converts a database row to a value of type 'a'.\n  fromRow :: Conn -> [SqlValue]
  -> IO a\n\n  -- | Converts a value of type 'a' to a database row.\n  toRow :: Conn
  -> a -> IO [SqlValue]\n\n  -- | Returns the name of the primary key field for a
  type 'a'.\n  idField :: String\n\n  -- | Returns a list of tuples that map field
  names to column names for a type 'a'.\n  fieldsToColumns :: [(String, String)]\n\n
  \ -- | Returns the name of the table for a type 'a'.\n  tableName :: String\n\n
  \ -- | Returns True if the primary key field for a type 'a' is autoincremented by
  the database.\n  autoIncrement :: Bool\n```\n\n### Default Behaviour\n\n`idField`,
  `fieldsToColumns` and `tableName` are used to define the mapping between Haskell
  types and database tables.\n\n- The default implementations of `idField` returns
  a default value for the field name of the primary key field of a type `a`:\nThe
  type name in lower case, plus \"ID\".\nE.g. `idField @Book` will return `\"bookID\"`.\n\n-
  `tableName` returns the name of the database table used for type `a`. The default
  implementation simply returns the constructor name of `a`. E.g. `tableName @Book`
  will return `\"Book\"`.\n\n- `fieldsToColumns` returns a list of tuples that map
  field names of type `a` to database column names for a type. The default implementation
  simply returns a list of tuples that map the field names of `a` to the field names
  of `a`. E.g. `fieldsToColumns @Person` will return `[(\"personID\",\"personID\"),(\"name\",\"name\"),(\"age\",\"age\"),(\"address\",\"address\")]`.\n\n-
  `autoIncrement` returns `True` by default. This means that the primary key field
  of a type `a` is assumed to be autoincremented by the database. If this is not the
  case, you can override the default implementation to return `False`.\n\n`fromRow`
  and `toRow` are used to convert between Haskell types and database rows. \n\n- `fromRow`
  converts a database row, represented by a `[SqlValue]` to a value of type `a`. \n\n-
  `toRow` converts a value of type `a` to a `[SqlValue]`, representing a database
  row. \n\nThe default implementations of `fromRow` and `toRow` expects that type
  `a` has a single constructor and a selector for each field. All fields are expected
  to have a 1:1 mapping to a column in the database table.\nThus each field must have
  a type that can be converted to and from a `SqlValue`. \n\nFor example \n\n```haskell\ntoRow
  conn (Person {personID = 1234, name = \"Alice\", age = 27, address = \"Elmstreet
  1\"}) \n````\n\nwill return \n\n```haskell\n[SqlInt64 1234,SqlString \"Alice\",SqlInt64
  27,SqlString \"Elmstreet 1\"]\n```\n\nAnd `fromRow` does the inverse: \n```haskell\nfromRow
  conn [SqlInt64 1234,SqlString \"Alice\",SqlInt64 27,SqlString \"Elmstreet 1\"] ::
  IO Person\n``` \n\nreturns \n\n```haskell\nPerson {personID = 1234, name = \"Alice\",
  age = 27, address = \"Elmstreet 1\"}\n```\n\nThe conversion functions `toRow` and
  `fromRow` both carry an additional `Conn` argument. This argument is not used by
  the default implementations, but it can be used to provide database access during
  the conversion process. We will cover this later.\n\n### Customizing the default
  behaviour\n\nThe default implementations of `idField`, `fieldsToColumns`, `tableName`,
  `fromRow` and `toRow` can be customized by overriding the default implementations.\nOveriding
  `idField`, `fieldsToColumns` and `tableName` will be required when your database
  tables do not follow the default naming conventions.\n\nFor example, if we have
  a database table `BOOK_TBL` with the following columns:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE
  BOOK_TBL \n  ( bookId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, \n    bookTitle TEXT, \n    bookAuthor
  TEXT, \n    bookYear INTEGER\n  );\n```\nand we want to map this table to a Haskell
  data type `Book`:\n\n```haskell\ndata Book = Book\n  { book_id :: Int,\n    title
  \  :: String,\n    author  :: String,\n    year    :: Int\n  }\n  deriving (Generic,
  Show)\n```\n\nThen we can customize the default implementations of `idField`, `fieldsToColumns`
  and `tableName` to achieve the desired mapping:\n\n```haskell\ninstance Entity Book
  where\n  -- this is the primary key field of the Book data type (not following the
  default naming convention)\n  idField = \"book_id\"\n\n  -- this defines the mapping
  between the field names of the Book data type and the column names of the database
  table\n  fieldsToColumns = [(\"book_id\", \"bookId\"), (\"title\", \"bookTitle\"),
  (\"author\", \"bookAuthor\"), (\"year\", \"bookYear\")]\n\n  -- this is the name
  of the database table\n  tableName = \"BOOK_TBL\"\n```\n\nOverriding `fromRow` and
  `toRow` will be required when your database tables do not follow the default mapping
  conventions.\nWe will see some examples in later sections.\n\n## Handling enumeration
  fields\n\nSay we have a data type `Book` with an enumeration field of type `BookCategory`:\n\n```haskell\ndata
  Book = Book\n  { bookID :: Int,\n    title   :: String,\n    author  :: String,\n
  \   year    :: Int,\n    category :: BookCategory\n  }\n  deriving (Generic, Entity,
  Show)\n\ndata BookCategory = Fiction | Travel | Arts | Science | History | Biography
  | Other\n  deriving (Generic, Show, Enum)\n```\n\nIn this case everything works
  out of the box, because *GenericPersistence* provides `Convertible` instances for
  all `Enum` types. `Convertible` instances are used to convert between Haskell types
  and database types.\n\nIf you do not want to use `Enum` types for your enumeration
  fields, you have to implement `Convertible` instances manually:\n\n```haskell\ndata
  BookCategory = Fiction | Travel | Arts | Science | History | Biography | Other\n
  \ deriving (Generic, Show, Read)\n\ninstance Convertible BookCategory SqlValue where\n
  \ safeConvert = Right . toSql . show\n  \ninstance Convertible SqlValue BookCategory
  where\n  safeConvert = Right . read . fromSql  \n```\n\n## Handling embedded Objects\n\nSay
  we have a data type `Article` with a field of type `Author`:\n\n```haskell\ndata
  Article = Article\n  { articleID :: Int,\n    title     :: String,\n    author    ::
  Author,\n    year      :: Int\n  }\n  deriving (Generic, Show, Eq)\n\ndata Author
  = Author\n  { authorID :: Int,\n    name     :: String,\n    address  :: String\n
  \ }\n  deriving (Generic, Show, Eq)  \n```\n\nIf we don't want to store the `Author`
  as a separate table, we can use the following approach to embed the `Author` into
  the `Article` table:\n\n```haskell\ninstance Entity Article where\n  -- in the fields
  to column mapping we specify that all fields of the \n  -- Author type are also
  mapped to columns of the Article table:\n  fieldsToColumns :: [(String, String)]\n
  \ fieldsToColumns = [(\"articleID\", \"articleID\"),\n                       (\"title\",
  \"title\"), \n                       (\"authorID\", \"authorID\"), \n                       (\"authorName\",
  \"authorName\"), \n                       (\"authorAddress\", \"authorAddress\"),\n
  \                      (\"year\", \"year\")\n                    ]\n\n  -- in fromRow
  we have to manually construct the Author object from the \n  -- respective columns
  of the Article table and insert it \n  -- into the Article object:\n  fromRow _conn
  row = return $ Article (col 0) (col 1) author (col 5)\n    where\n      col i =
  fromSql (row !! i)\n      author = Author (col 2) (col 3) (col 4)\n\n  -- in toRow
  we have to manually extract the fields of the Author object\n  -- and insert them
  into the respective columns of the Article table:\n  toRow _conn a = return [toSql
  (articleID a), toSql (title a), toSql authID, toSql authorName, toSql authorAddress,
  toSql (year a)]\n    where \n      authID = authorID (author a)\n      authorName
  = name (author a)\n      authorAddress = address (author a)\n```\n\n## Handling
  1:1 references\n\nIf we have the same data types as in the previous example, but
  we want to store the `Author` in a separate table, we can use the following approach:\n\n```haskell\ndata
  Article = Article\n  { articleID :: Int,\n    title     :: String,\n    author    ::
  Author,\n    year      :: Int\n  }\n  deriving (Generic, Show, Eq)\n\ndata Author
  = Author\n  { authorID :: Int,\n    name     :: String,\n    address  :: String\n
  \ }\n  deriving (Generic, Entity, Show, Eq)\n\n\ninstance Entity Article where\n
  \ fieldsToColumns :: [(String, String)]                      -- ommitting the author
  field,\n  fieldsToColumns =                                          -- as this
  can not be mapped to a single column\n    [ (\"articleID\", \"articleID\"),                            --
  instead we invent a new column authorID         \n      (\"title\", \"title\"),\n
  \     (\"authorID\", \"authorID\"),\n      (\"year\", \"year\")\n    ]\n\n  fromRow
  :: Conn -> [SqlValue] -> IO Article\n  fromRow conn row = do    \n    authorById
  <- fromJust <$> selectById conn (row !! 2)  -- load author by foreign key\n    return
  $ rawArticle {author = authorById}                -- add author to article\n    where\n
  \     rawArticle = Article (col 0) (col 1)                   -- create article from
  row, \n                           (Author (col 2) \"\" \"\") (col 3)    -- using
  a dummy author\n        where\n          col i = fromSql (row !! i)\n\n  toRow ::
  Conn -> Article -> IO [SqlValue]\n  toRow conn a = do\n    persist conn (author
  a)                                  -- persist author first\n    return [toSql (articleID
  a), toSql (title a),            -- return row for article table where \n            toSql
  $ authorID (author a), toSql (year a)]     -- authorID is foreign key to author
  table \n```\n\nPersisting the `Author`as a side effect in `toRow` may sound like
  an *interesting* idea...\nThis step is optional. But then the user has to make sure
  that the `Author` is persisted before the `Article` is persisted.\n\n\n## Handling
  1:n references\n\nNow let's change the previous example by having a list of Articles
  in the `Author` type:\n\n```haskell\ndata Author = Author\n  { authorID :: Int,\n
  \   name     :: String,\n    address  :: String,\n    articles :: [Article]\n  }\n
  \ deriving (Generic, Show, Eq)\n\ndata Article = Article\n  { articleID :: Int,\n
  \   title     :: String,\n    authorId  :: Int,\n    year      :: Int\n  }\n  deriving
  (Generic, Entity, Show, Eq)\n```\n\nSo now we have a `1:n` relationship between
  `Author` and `Article`. \n\nWe can handle this situation by using the following
  instance declaration for `Author`:\n\n```haskell\ninstance Entity Author where\n
  \ fieldsToColumns :: [(String, String)]                   -- ommitting the articles
  field, \n  fieldsToColumns =                                       -- as this can
  not be mapped to a single column\n    [ (\"authorID\", \"authorID\"),\n      (\"name\",
  \"name\"),\n      (\"address\", \"address\")\n    ]\n\n  fromRow :: Conn -> [SqlValue]
  -> IO Author\n  fromRow conn row = do\n    let authID = head row                                  --
  authorID is the first column\n    articlesBy <- select conn (field \"authorId\"
  =. authID) -- retrieve all articles by this author\n    return rawAuthor {articles
  = articlesBy}               -- add the articles to the author\n    where\n      rawAuthor
  = Author (col 0) (col 1) (col 2) []        -- create the author from row (w/o articles)\n
  \     col i = fromSql (row !! i)                           -- helper function to
  convert SqlValue to Haskell type\n\n  toRow :: Conn -> Author -> IO [SqlValue]\n
  \ toRow conn a = do\n    mapM_ (persist conn) (articles a)                     --
  persist all articles of this author (update or insert)\n    return [toSql (authorID
  a),                           -- return the author as a list of SqlValues\n            toSql
  (name a), toSql (address a)]\n```\n\nPersisting all articles of an author as a side
  effect during the conversion of the author to a row may seem *special*...\nYou can
  ommit this step. But then you have to persist the articles manually before persisting
  the author.\n\n## Performing queries with the Query DSL\n\nThe library provides
  a simple DSL for performing `SELECT`queries. The `select` function \n\n```haskell\nselect
  :: forall a. (Entity a) => Conn -> WhereClauseExpr -> IO [a]\n```\n\nThis function
  retrieves all entities of type `a` that match some query criteria.\nThe function
  takes an HDBC connection (wrapped in a `Conn`) and a `WhereClauseExpr` as parameters.\nThe
  function returns a (possibly empty) list of all matching entities.\n\nThe `WhereClauseExpr`
  is constructed using a small set of functions and infix operators.\n\nThere are
  a set of infix operators `(=.), (>.), (<.), (>=.), (<=.), (<>.), like, between,
  in', contains` that define field comparisons:\n\n```haskell\nfield \"name\" =. \"John\"\n\nfield
  \"age\" >=. 18\n\nfield \"age\" `between` (18, 30)\n\nfield \"name\" `like` \"J%\"\n\nfield
  \"name\" `in'` [\"John\", \"Jane\"]\n```\n\nThen we have three function `isNull`,
  `allEntries` and `byId` that also define simple `WHERE` clauses:\n\n```haskell\nisNull
  (field \"name\") -- matches all entries where the name field is NULL\n\nbyId 42
  \              -- matches the entry where the primary key column has the value 42\n\nallEntries
  \           -- matches all entries of the table\n```\n\nIt is also possible to apply
  SQL functions to fields:\n\n```haskell\nlower = sqlFun \"LOWER\" -- define a function
  that applies the SQL function LOWER to a field\n\nlower(field \"name\") =. \"all
  lowercase\"\n```\n\nThese field-wise comparisons can be combined using the logical
  operators `&&.`, `||.` and `not'`:\n\n```haskell\n(field \"name\" `like` \"J%\")
  &&. (field \"age\" >=. 18)\n\n(field \"name\" =. \"John\") ||. (field \"name\" =.
  \"Jane\")\n\nnot' (field \"name\" =. \"John\")\n```\n\nThe `select` function will
  then use the `WhereClauseExpr` constructed from these operators and functions to
  generate a SQL query that retrieves all matching entities:\n\n```haskell\n\nageField
  :: Field\nageField = field \"age\"\n\nthirtySomethings <- select @Person conn (ageField
  `between` (30, 39))\n```\n\nIt is also possible to add `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses
  to the query:\n\n```haskell\nsortedPersons <- select @Person conn (allEntries `orderBy`
  [(ageField,ASC), (nameField,DESC)])\n\nlimitedPersons <- select @Person conn (allEntries
  `limit` 25)\n\npageOfPersons <- select @Person conn (allEntries `limitOffset` (100,10))\n```\n\nYou
  will find more examples in the [test suite](https://github.com/thma/generic-persistence/blob/main/test/QuerySpec.hs).\n\n\n##
  Integrating user defined queries\n\nAs we have seen in the previous section, the
  library provides two functions `select` and `selectById` to query the database for
  entities.\n\nIf you want to use more complex queries, you can integrate HDBC SQL
  queries by using the `entitiesFromRows` function as in the following example:\n\n```haskell\nmain
  :: IO ()\nmain = do\n  -- connect to a database\n  conn <- connect SQLite <$> connectSqlite3
  \":memory:\" \n\n  -- initialize Person table\n  setupTableFor @Person conn\n\n
  \ let alice = Person 1 \"Alice\" 25 \"123 Main St\"\n      bob = Person 2 \"Bob\"
  30 \"456 Elm St\"\n      charlie = Person 3 \"Charlie\" 35 \"789 Pine St\"\n      dave
  = Person 4 \"Dave\" 40 \"1011 Oak St\"\n      eve = Person 5 \"Eve\" 45 \"1213 Maple
  St\"\n      frank = Person 6 \"Frank\" 50 \"1415 Walnut St\"\n      people = [alice,
  bob, charlie, dave, eve, frank]\n      \n  -- insert all persons into the database\n
  \ insertMany conn people\n\n  -- perform a custom query with HDBC\n  stmt = \"SELECT
  * FROM Person WHERE age >= ? ORDER BY age ASC\"\n  resultRows <- quickQuery conn
  stmt [toSql (40 :: Int)]\n\n  -- convert the resulting rows into a list of Person
  objects\n  fourtplussers <- entitiesFromRows @Person conn resultRows\n  print fourtplussers\n```\n\nOf
  course this approach is not type safe. It is up to the user to make sure that the
  query returns the correct columns. \n\n## The `Conn` Connection Type\n\nThe `Conn`
  type is a wrapper around an `IConnection` obtained from an HDBC backend driver like
  `HDBC-sqlite3` or `hdbc-postgresql`. It is used to pass the connection to the database
  to *Generic-Persistence*. All functions of the library that require a database connection
  take a `Conn` as an argument.\n\nHDBC provides a very similar type called `ConnectionWrapper`.
  The main reason for such a wrapper type is to simplify the type signatures of the
  library functions. \n\nIn addition, the `Conn` type provides additional database
  related information that is not available in the `ConnectionWrapper` type. For example,
  the `Conn` type contains the name of the database driver that is used. This information
  can be used to generate the correct SQL statements for different database backends.\n`Conn`
  also carries a flag that indicates whether implicit commits should be used by the
  library. This flag is set to `True` by default. If you want to use explicit commits,
  you can set the flag to `False` by modifying the `Conn` value:\n  \n```haskell\nc
  <- connect SQLite <$> connectSqlite3 \":memory:\"\nlet conn = c {implicitCommit
  = False}\n```\n\n## Connection Pooling\n\nThe library provides a simple connection
  pool for managing database connections. \nThis is a must in multi-threaded environments
  where multiple threads may need to access the database at the same time. A typical
  use case is a REST service that uses a database to store its data. \n\nThe connection
  Pool is implemented based on the [resource-pool](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/resource-pool)
  library. `generic-persistence` exposes a `ConnectionPool` type and two function
  `createConnPool` and `withResource` to create and use a connection pool.\n\nThe
  following example shows how to create a connection pool and how to use it to perform
  a database query:\n\n```haskell\n\nsqlLitePool :: FilePath -> IO ConnectionPool\nsqlLitePool
  sqlLiteFile = createConnPool SQLite sqlLiteFile connectSqlite3 10 100\n\nmain ::
  IO ()\nmain = do\n  connPool <- sqlLitePool \":memory:\" \n  let alice = Person
  123456 \"Alice\" 25 \"123 Main St\"\n  withResource connPool $ \\conn -> do\n    setupTableFor
  @Person conn\n    insert conn alice\n    allPersons <- select conn allEntries ::
  IO [Person]\n    print allPersons\n```\n\nYou'll find a more complete example in
  the [servant-gp repo](https://github.com/thma/servant-gp/blob/main/src/ServerUtils.hs#L45).\nThere
  I have set up a sample REST service based on Servant that uses *Generic-Persistence*
  and a connection pool to manage the database connections.\n"
