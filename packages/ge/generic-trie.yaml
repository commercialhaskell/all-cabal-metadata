description: ! 'This type implements maps where the keys are themselves

  complex structured data.  For example, the keys may be

  the abstract syntax trees for a programming language.

  The map is implemented as a trie, so common parts of the

  keys will be shared in the representation.  The library

  provides a generic implementation of the data structure,

  so values of types that have support for ''Generic'' may

  be automatically used as keys in the map.'
