synopsis: A map, where the keys may be complex structured data.
changelog: |
  0.3.2
  -----

  * Add a `trieAlter` method, and use it to speed up `alter`, `insert` and
    `delete`.
  * Make the `Show` instance user friendly.
  * Add support for GHC versions up to 9.4.
  * Fix builds on GHC 7.8, and with old `containers` versions.
  * Stop pretending to support GHC 7.4 and 7.6. These have not actually worked in
    some time, and it is hard to test on them.

  0.3.1
  -----

  * Improved strictness
  * GHC 8.4 compatibility

  0.3.0.2
  -------

  * GHC 8 compatibility

description: |-
  This type implements maps where the keys are themselves
  complex structured data.  For example, the keys may be
  the abstract syntax trees for a programming language.
  The map is implemented as a trie, so common parts of the
  keys will be shared in the representation.  The library
  provides a generic implementation of the data structure,
  so values of types that have support for 'Generic' may
  be automatically used as keys in the map.
