  \ \n\nThis program accepts a matrix with distances between nodes (see below for
  an\nexample). It then proceeds to calculate the Hamiltonian path with the shortest\ndistance
  between each pair of nodes, where the path has to travel from the\nstart, then to
  all other nodes, finally stopping at the last node.\n\nWe further calculate all
  neighbour probabilities via Inside/Outside. This means\nthat for any two nodes we
  calculate the weight of the edge between these two\nnodes. The weight is between
  ``[0, ... ,1]`` where ``0`` denotes the the nodes\nare almost surely not direct
  neighbours on a weighted-randomly drawn path,\nwhile ``1`` denotes that they almost
  surely are.\n\nFinally, we calculate the probability that a node is one of the terminal
  nodes\nin the Hamiltonian path, i.e. either the first or the last node.\n\n\n##
  Installation / Pre-compiled Binaries\n\n- Binaries are available from github for
  Linux x86-64. They can be downloaded\n  here: <https://github.com/choener/Gene-CluEDO/releases>\n-
  Installation from sources is possible using the Haskell stack tool, as\n  described
  at the bottom of this page:\n  <http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/~choener/software/Gene-CluEDO.html>\n-
  Another installation option is via ``cabal new-install`` (preferred for\n  development,
  but more involved to setup)\n\n\n## Input data used for the *Expansion of Gene Clusters*
  paper\n\nThe data sets are available together with the sources or the binary release.\nCheck
  the ``data`` folder. The ``run-all.sh`` script runs the four examples.\n\n\n## The
  Biological Problem We Solve\n\n[Wikipedia on Hox clusters.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hox_cluster)\n\nHox
  clusters are a set of genes that are linearly ordered. The genes are\n(assumed)
  to have a single originating gene, and repeated duplication has led\nto the cluster
  with unknown duplication tree.\n\nThe long time scales involved make it hard to
  produce a tree that can be\ntrusted. This program therefore produces summary information
  in the form of\nedge path probabilities.\n\n\n## Example matrix:\n\nIn this artificial
  distance matrix, we have prime numbers as distances between\nnodes. Store the matrix
  in a file, say ``mat.dat``.\n\n```\n#   A   B   C   D   E\nA   0   2   3   5   7\nB
  \  2   0  11  13  17\nC   3  11   0  19  23\nD   5  13  19   0  27\nE   7  17  23
  \ 27   0\n```\n\nNow, run the algorithm ``./GeneCluEDO -o output.run ./mat.dat``.
  After the\nprogram has run, ``output.run`` contains the a wealth of information
  about the\ninput. The maximum likelihood path, the edge weights, end probabilities,
  and\nmaximum expected accuracy path are calculated. Two additional files, here\n``output.boundary.svg``,
  and ``output.edge.svg`` are produced. The boundary\nplot provides graphical output
  of the probability that a node (or gene) is the\nstart or end node. The edge probability
  plot provides probabilities for each\nedge (i,j) between nodes. This shows the most
  likely neighbors, and therefore\ngenetic relationship, over all possible gene orders.\n\n\n\n####
