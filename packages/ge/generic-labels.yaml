description: |-
  Handle various conversion operations between record types,
  such as projecting out a collection of fields from a record,
  or plugging in values for a subset of the fields of a larger record.

  Works both with built-in Haskell records, as well as explicitly labelled types
  @ ( #label := value ) :: ( "label" := Type ) @.

  Project out a smaller record using @project@:

  @
    data IBXD x = IBXD { i :: Int, b :: Bool, x :: x, d :: Double }
      deriving stock Generic
    data XI x = XI { x :: c, i :: Int }
      deriving stock Generic
  @

  Plug in a subset of fields using @inject@:

  @
    xi_into_ibxd :: XI x -> IBXD x -> IBXD x
    xi_into_ibxd = inject
  @

  Create a record out of two collections of arguments using @adapt@:

  @
    xi_plus_bd_makes_ibxd :: XI x -> ( "b" := Bool, "d" := Double ) -> IBXD x
    xi_plus_bd_makes_ibxd = adapt
  @
