  # barbies-layered

  This is like [barbies](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/barbies) but these clothes are layered.

  For example when there is a following data type,

  ```haskell
  data Foo = Foo { foo :: [Int] }
  ```

  barbies requires a following.

  ```haskell
  data Foo f = Foo { foo :: f [Int] }
  ```

  But in case of barbies-layered,

  ```haskell
  data Foo f = Foo { foo :: f [f Int] }
  ```

  A typical difference is a type of `bmap`.

  ```haskell
  -- barbies
  type FunctorB :: ((k -> Type) -> Type) -> Constraint
  class FunctorB b where
    bmap :: (forall a. f a -> g a) -> b f -> b g

  -- barbies-layered
  type FunctorB :: ((Type -> Type) -> Type) -> Constraint
  class FunctorB b where
    bmap :: (Functor f, Functor g) => (forall a. f a -> g a) -> b f -> b g
  ```
