  Barley - A seed for learning Haskell
  ====================================

  Barley is an environment for tinkering with [Haskell][1]. It is a web server
  with an embedded simple programming environment rendered as web pages.
  The environment allows you to easily edit Haskell code and quickly see the
  result of running it.

  Barley includes a tutorial aimed at people with some programming and web
  experience, but it assumes no exposure to Haskell or functional programming.
  The tutorial takes the developer from generating a simple web page through
  a modest web application with database backend storage. Along the way it
  exposes the programmer to the basic idioms needed to do simple programming
  tasks.

  Barley is based on the [Snap framework][2] for creating web programming in
  Haskell. Barley adds a simple web application skeleton to support both the
  live development environment and the tutorial projects. After going through
  the tutorial, developers can use Barley to create and explore their own
  simple web projects. Beyond that, they can smoothly transition to using the
  whole Snap framework and the wealth of available Haskell libraries.

  Status
  ======

  This is in the *very early concept stage*. We aren't even at a 0.1 release!
  Read this code at your own risk!

  Developers
  ----------

  Barley was conceived during a flurry of Nepalese food by [Johan Tibell][jt]
  and [Mark Lentczner][ml]. We got immediate encouragement from others 'round
  the table and spent the rest of the night plotting, and in Johan's case coding.
  The next morning we found ourselves in a coffee house with other Haskellers
  cheering us on as we knocked off the first coding tasks.

  Running
  -------

  If you can't hold back and download this code, you can run it like so:

      cabal configure
      cabal build
      ghci -isrc:dist/build/autogen src/Main.hs
      > :main start playground

  Note:

  * `start` = initialize a new project if needed, then run barley on it.
  * `playground` is just the name of a project directory, barley will create
    it if needed.
  * If you don't `cabal install` barley, then it won't have access to its
    data directory unless you start it from the root of the dev. tree.
