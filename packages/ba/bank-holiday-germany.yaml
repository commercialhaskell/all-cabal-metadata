  # bank-holiday-germany

  This module provides calculation of bank holidays in Germany.

  Most of these bank holidays are also public aka legal holidays
  throughout Germany. You can use `isPublicHoliday` to check if a
  holiday is also a legal holiday.

  Legal holidays are generally off for all employees. Bank holidays that
  are no legal holidays as well are generally only off for bank employees.

  Note: There are even more public holidays in each federal state which
  are not covered by this module.
