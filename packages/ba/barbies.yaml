changelog: ! "# Changelog for barbies\n\n## 0.1.2.0\n  - Use 'Monoid' and not 'Semigroup'
  as constraints for the 'Monoid' instance\n\n## 0.1.1.0\n  - Add `instance Semigroup
  (Barbie b)` to go along the `Monoid` instance\n\n## 0.1.0.1\n  - Works under GHC
  8.0.2, but notice one needs to use empty instance\n    declarations, because ghc
  chokes on `deriving` clauses.\n\n\n## 0.1.0.0 - Initial release\n"

description: ! "# barbie\n\nTypes that are parametric on unary type-constructors that
  control\ntheir shapes are like Barbies that can wear different clothes\nto become
  a different doll. This is a common Haskell-idiom. E.g.,\n\n```haskell\n\ndata Barbie
  f\n  = Barbie\n      { name :: f String\n      , age  :: f Int\n      }\n\nb1 ::
  Barbie Last       -- Barbie with a monoid structure\nb2 :: Barbie (Const a)  --
  container Barbie\nb3 :: Barbie Identity   -- Barbie's new clothes\n\n```\n\nThis
  package provides basic classes and abstractions to work with these types and easily
  transform them.\n"
