description: "Babylon\n-------\n\nThis is an implementation of a simple two-player
  game\nin Haskell using the wxWidgets GUI toolkit.\nThis program allows you to play
  against the computer plays using\nthe classical minimax algorithm with alpha-beta
  prunning\n(based on Bird and Wadler's presentation in the \"Introduction\nto Functional
  Programming\").\n\nThe rules of the game are very simple: \n* there are 12 stone
  tablets in 4 colors (3 of each color)\n* initially the stones are randomly placed
  on the table,\n  forming twelve 1-stone piles\n* on his/her turn, a player moves
  one pile ontop of another\n  provided that they have the same height or the same
  top \n  color (or both)\n* the first player who cannot perform a move loses the
  game.\n\nThe game play very fast, typically under 5 mins; since there\nare only
  12 piles at the start, and each turn decrements one \npile, the game must finish
  in at most 11 moves.\n\nNote that there is a winning strategy for the second player,
  but\nit does not appear to be a simple heuristic for it (?). \nThe computer will
  play the winning strategy at the hardest level, \nso it will always win as a second
  player at this level.\n\nThis was basically programmed in a single day as an experiment
  \nusing this wxWidgets (though I was experienced with Haskell). \nI thought it would
  be a nice addition to show a simple but real\nHaskell program.\n\nIf you have any
  comments please drop me a line,\n\nPedro Vasconcelos\npbv@dcc.fc.up.pt\nDepartment
