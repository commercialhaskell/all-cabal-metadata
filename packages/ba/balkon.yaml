  # Revision history for Balkón

  ## 1.0.0.0 -- 2023-03-13

  * Text shaping using HarfBuzz.

  * Breaking text on line and character boundaries using the International
    Components for Unicode (ICU) library.

  * Trimming white space at the end of lines.

  * Calculation of containing block bounds and fragment bounds.

  * Support for plain text (single font and line height) in one horizontal
    direction (LTR or RTL).

  * Input can be divided into spans. This division will be preserved in the
    output.

  * Each span can use a different language for text shaping and line breaking.

description: |2-

  Given an input text and formatting options, Balkón produces an inline
  layout with defined glyph positions and box coordinates, all within a
  containing unit called a paragraph.

  Internally, HarfBuzz is used to shape individual runs of text, each of
  which fits within one line and has a constant script, direction, language,
  and formatting. Balkón abstracts this so that you can provide text with any
  mix of these attributes and a desired line width for line breaking.
