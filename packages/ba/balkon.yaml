  # Revision history for Balkón

  ## 1.1.0.0 -- 2023-05-31

  * Updated support for bidirectional text:

      * Implemented correct order of directional runs for paragraphs whose
        base direction is RTL.

      * Numbers now create an implicit LTR embedding level.

      * The direction of weak directional characters and neutral characters is
        now determined by the embedding level of surrounding characters, or if
        that does not match, by the base paragraph direction.

      * For the legacy plain text interface, base paragraph direction is now set
        according to the first strong character.

      * Shaping uses the base paragraph direction when no strongly directional
        characters are present.

  ## 1.0.0.1 -- 2023-05-18

  * Added another test with "shaped runs" format to allow manual testing of
    pagination.

  ## 1.0.0.0 -- 2023-05-15

  * Added new `Data.Text.ParagraphLayout.Rich` interface to support rich text.

      * Supports multiple fonts in the same paragraph. Where line height varies,
        text will be aligned by its top edge.

      * Supports nested boxes, each with optional spacing applied to its left
        and right edge.

      * Requires user to set base text direction (LTR or RTL).

  * Moved existing plain text interface into `Data.Text.ParagraphLayout.Plain`
    submodule and marked it as deprecated.

  * Marked `Data.Text.ParagraphLayout.ParagraphConstruction` as deprecated.

  * Input text spans can now have arbitrary user data attached to them.
    All related data types (`Paragraph`, `Span`, `Fragment`, `SpanLayout`,
    `ParagraphLayout`) have been extended with a type variable.

  * Future-proofed `ParagraphOptions` and `SpanOptions` by hiding their
    constructors. Use `defaultParagraphOptions` and `defaultSpanOptions` instead.

  * Added line numbers to laid out fragments.

  * Added information about ancestor boxes of laid out fragments.
    The plain text interface implicitly generates one box per span, while
    the rich text interface gives the user direct control over the box hierarchy.

  * Increased font size for the "shaped runs" output so that it better fits
    a window with 640 pixels of width.

  * Fixed compatibility with base < 4.15.

  ## 0.3.0.0 -- 2023-04-13

  * Added partial support for bidirectional text
    (LTR and RTL in the same paragraph).

      * The paragraph direction is assumed to be LTR.
        This will be configurable in a future interface.

      * Only strong directional characters are used to determine text direction.

      * The direction of weak directional characters and neutral characters is
        determined by the nearest preceding strong directional character, or if
        none is found, the nearest following strong directional character.

      * Explicit bidirectional formatting characters are ignored.

  * Exposed functions to allow verification of correct input text slicing:
    `paragraphSpanBounds`, `paragraphSpanTexts`, and `paragraphText`.

  ## 0.2.1.0 -- 2023-04-04

  * Added pagination.

  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2023-03-28

  * Added support for forced (hard) line breaks in the input text.

  * Now also trimming white space at the beginning of lines.

  * Internally, language tags will be cut at the first invalid character before
    being passed to ICU.

  * Tests will generate output in "shaped runs" format which can be passed to
    a text rendering application.

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2023-03-13

  * Text shaping using HarfBuzz.

  * Breaking text on line and character boundaries using the International
    Components for Unicode (ICU) library.

  * Trimming white space at the end of lines.

  * Calculation of containing block bounds and fragment bounds.

  * Support for plain text (single font and line height) in one horizontal
    direction (LTR or RTL).

  * Input can be divided into spans. This division will be preserved in the
    output.

  * Each span can use a different language for text shaping and line breaking.

  # Balkón

  [Repository](https://git.argonaut-constellation.org/~jaro/balkon) |
  [Issue tracker](https://todo.argonaut-constellation.org/~jaro/balkon)

  Haskell library built on top of HarfBuzz to lay out text within a paragraph.

  Just like flowers on a balcony, text must be arranged carefully within a
  limited space and put into neat little boxes.

  Intended to be the inline layout engine for
  [The Argonaut Stack](https://argonaut-constellation.org/).
