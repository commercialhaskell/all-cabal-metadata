  # Revision history for Balkón

  ## 0.3.0.0 -- 2023-04-13

  * Added partial support for bidirectional text
    (LTR and RTL in the same paragraph).

      * The paragraph direction is assumed to be LTR.
        This will be configurable in a future interface.

      * Only strong directional characters are used to determine text direction.

      * The direction of weak directional characters and neutral characters is
        determined by the nearest preceding strong directional character, or if
        none is found, the nearest following strong directional character.

      * Explicit bidirectional formatting characters are ignored.

  * Exposed functions to allow verification of correct input text slicing:
    `paragraphSpanBounds`, `paragraphSpanTexts`, and `paragraphText`.

  ## 0.2.1.0 -- 2023-04-04

  * Added pagination.

  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2023-03-28

  * Added support for forced (hard) line breaks in the input text.

  * Now also trimming white space at the beginning of lines.

  * Internally, language tags will be cut at the first invalid character before
    being passed to ICU.

  * Tests will generate output in "shaped runs" format which can be passed to
    a text rendering application.

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2023-03-13

  * Text shaping using HarfBuzz.

  * Breaking text on line and character boundaries using the International
    Components for Unicode (ICU) library.

  * Trimming white space at the end of lines.

  * Calculation of containing block bounds and fragment bounds.

  * Support for plain text (single font and line height) in one horizontal
    direction (LTR or RTL).

  * Input can be divided into spans. This division will be preserved in the
    output.

  * Each span can use a different language for text shaping and line breaking.

  # Balkón

  [Repository](https://git.argonaut-constellation.org/~jaro/balkon) |
  [Issue tracker](https://todo.argonaut-constellation.org/~jaro/balkon)

  Haskell library built on top of HarfBuzz to lay out text within a paragraph.

  Just like flowers on a balcony, text must be arranged carefully within a
  limited space and put into neat little boxes.

  Intended to be the inline layout engine for
  [The Argonaut Stack](https://argonaut-constellation.org/).
