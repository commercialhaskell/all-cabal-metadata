  # The backstop command

  The backstop command is a UNIX, Linux, and *BSD tool. Intuitively,
  backstop fills in the missing objects or holes that exist in the
  target directory relative to the source directories thereby creating a
  merged view of the target and source directories.  De-backstop undoes
  this.  See "backstop -m" for a manual page or the
  [homepage](https://github.com/mdgabriel/backstop.git) for more
  information.

  The command backstop was created over twenty years ago to manage
  development environement toolchains in which part of the project was
  under source control and part of the project was not, e.g. binaries.
  It was inspired by lndir, graft, and "Source Control to Project
  Control: Applying RCS and SCCS" by Don Bolinger and Tan Bronson.
  Techniques have changed with time, but backstop is a robust tool
  with an extensive test suite that runs around 2700 tests, a
  combination of HUnit, QuickCheck, and black box tests.

  In the author's obviously biased veiw, backstop has pedagogical
  value.  The module Backstop uses a ReaderT monad transformer to
  manage an Environment passed to it via the command line, a StateT
  monad transformer to keep track of a set of counters and to keep track
  of the status of direcotry content while backstopping or
  de-backstopping.  The last two are Monoids.  With this structure,
  the handling of a dry-run for backstop or de-backstop is rather
  powerful even it is a bit subtle (obscure) to understand.

  On a personal note, the author truly began to appreciate Haskell after
  creating the Backstop module and its test suite and has not stopped
  appreciating Haskell since.

  DESCRIPTION
     Backstop a target directory by source directories thereby
     creating a backing chain using relative symbolic links by default
     or absolute symbolic links by option.  If more than one source
     directory is given, backstop the target directory with each
     source directory in turn starting from left to right on the
     command line.

     Intuitively, backstop fills in the missing objects or holes that
     exist in the target directory relative to the source directories
     thereby creating a merged view of the target and source
     directories.

     De-backstop a target directory by its source directories.  In
     this case, the source directories no longer need to exist.  If
     more than one source directory is given, de-backstop the target
     directory by the source directories.

     Symbolic links are never followed.  However, the target and
     source directories are canonicalized (realpath(3)) internally by
     the command backstop before backstopping and de-backstoppoing.

     By default no output is displayed except possibly to STDERR.

  ALGORITHM
     There must be at least two arguments or operands.  The first
     operand is the target directory, and the second operand and
     beyond are source directories.  The target and source directory
     must be parallel directories, that is, neither canonicalized
     (realpath(3)) directory path may be a sub-directory of the other.
     If the above is not true, a usage error occurs.

     Nevertheless, pathnames are internally in reduced form such that
     symbolic link names are treated literally when finding directory
     names.  See "cd -L" of ksh(1).  In other words, components in the
     pathname that are not directories but symbolic links to
     directories are not resolved to their corresponding directories.

     A list of objects or names is collected under the root of the
     source directory excluding the directory dot (.) and the
     directory double-dot (..).  If the list is empty, the algorithm
     is done, otherwise the objects divide into two classes, objects
     that are not directories and objects that are directories.  There
     are five possibilities:

     1. The object is either dot (.) or double-dot (..) whereupon no
        action is taken.

     2. If an object of the same name as the name of the object under
        the root of the source directory does not exists under the
        root of the target directory, then a symbolic link, relative
        or absolute as required, is created under the root of the
        target directory to the object under the root of the source
        directory.  If populating (-p) and the object under the root
        of the source directory is a directory, then a sub-directory
        is created instead.

     3. If an object of the same name as the name of the object under
        the root of the source directory does exists under the root of
        the target directory and is a file, no action is taken,
        regardless of whether or not the object under the root of the
        source directory is a file or a directory.

     4. If an object of the same name as the name of the object under
        the root of the source directory does exists under the root of
        the target directory and is a directory, and if the object of
        the same name under the root of the source directory is a
        file, no action is taken.

     5. If an object of the same name as the name of the object under
        the root of the source directory does exists under the root of
        the target directory and is a directory, and if the object of
        the same name under the root of the source directory is also a
        directory, then recursion occurs with the objects of the same
        name under the roots of the target and source directories as
        new root target and source directories, respectively.

     When de-backstopping a target directory by source directories,
     the sources no longer need to exist.  Symbolic links under the
     target are removed if and only if they point to a pahtname under
     one of the source directories.  This can be determined even if
     the source directory no longer exists because symbolic links
     within directory pathnames are taken literally.  See "cd -L" of
     ksh(1).

     When de-populating while de-backstopping (-pd), a directory is
     removed if all objects within the directory are symbolic links
     that have been remove while de-backstopping.  An empty directory
     is removed if and only if there exists a corresponding directory
     path under one of the source directories as under the target
     directory.  This can only be determined if the source directory
     and correponding sub-directory still exist.  If not, then no
     action is taken.

  OPTIONS
     The following options are supported:

     -a Create symbolic links which are absolute paths.

     -d De-backstop the target directory by its source directories.
        The -a option has no affect on the -d option.

     -h Display a short command summary.

     -l Display the backstop license terms.

     -m Display this internal manual page.

     -n Take no action but trace possible program execution.  The -n
        option implies the -t option.

     -p Populate the target by making equivalent sub-directories of
        the source sub-directories instead of symbolic links for these
        sub-directories that point back into the sources.  For
        example, if the target directory is empty, then for a set of
        source directories, from left to right on the command line,
        this creates a combined directory structure of the sources
        under the target directory in which all non-directories are
        symbolic links pointing back into the source directories.
        This is similar to the lndir(1) command of the X consortium.

        With the -d option, all sub-directories emptied of symbolic
        links under the target directory are removed, and all empty
        directories are removed if and only if the correspoding
        sub-directory under the source directory exists.

     -r Report the number of symbolic links and directories created,
        the number of calls and maximum depth of backstop, the
        maximum breadth observed by backstop, and the number of non-
        fatal errors encountered.  With the -d option, show the
        number of symbolic links and directories removed.

     -t Show the trace of program execution.  The output is a list
        of executable commands.

     -v The version of backstop.

     -y A synopsis of the internal manual page.

  OPERANDS
     trgdir
        The directory that will be backed by other directories.  The
        target directory can be backed by multiple source directories
        where each source directory could be backed by yet another
        directory or multiple directories thereby creating an
        extensible backing chain.

     srcdir
        The directory which backs a target directory.  The source
        directory can be backed by multiple additional directories
        where each additional directory could be backed by yet another
        directory or multiple directories thereby creating an
        extensible backing chain.

  USAGE NOTES
     Evolved with ghc 6.10, 6.12, 7.0, 7.4, 7.10, 8.0.2, and 8.4.1.
     Tested with 8.4.1.

     backstop:

         EXIT CODE    MEANING
            251       Less than two operands.
            252       Not a directory, that is, trgdir or one or more
                      of the srcdir are not a directory.
            253       Not parallel directories, that is, a srcdir is
                      a sub-directory of trgdir or vice versa, or one
                      of the srcdir is a sub-directory of another
                      srcdir.
            254       Not yet implemented.
            255       Non-fatal errors occurred.  Error messages are
                      sent to STDERR for each non-fatal error that
                      occurred with return code equal to the number of
                      non-falal errors if less than 251, otherwise the
                      return code is 255, that is, "infinity".
