description: "I just wondered if you could make a library that\ndoesn't depend on
  base.\n\nI suppose this is a giant boon for all these \nalternate prelude libraries,\nyou
  could make your own alternate base.\n\nYou can just completly bypass the CLC and\nmake
  your own favorite haskell:\n\n+ Don't like monads? Don't define them!\n+ Don't like
  String? Don't define it!\n\nIn return, you lose the entire library ecosystem...\nbut
  hey, you're in control.\n"
