  CHANGES
  0.0.2 -> 0.0.3
   - Network.IRC.XChat.Example moved to
     Network.IRC.XChat.Examples.AutoOp
   - New example added : a simple counter
   - Plugin memory doesn't require to be Storable anymore
   - Less internal malloc/free
   - The memory type MUST now be defined in the programmer's module
   - Le type version a été enlevé
  0.0.1 -> 0.0.2
   - imports have been cleaned
   - corrected bug with the StripRules type
     (no-attribute and no-color had to be swapped)
   - now every allocated memory should be freed
     (it wasn't the case yet, as the previous version
      was the first one, and I just wanted some working
      stuff)
   - added some strictness annotations, but I guess many
     more should be added although it shouldn't make
     a real difference (it is just a binding after all)
  0.0.1
   - first release
   - not available on Hackage (and won't be)
  ====================
  Plans for later versions

  - more examples
  - consider removing the "XChatPlugin a" argument of all functions,
    since at first glance, one and only one plugin handle is defined
    in each plugin
  - replace event strings with an event type, for type safety and
    to avoid mistyping an event string. Furthermore, it improves
    the documentation to be able to get an exhaustive list of possible
    command; with strings we are never sure there is a forgotten one.

  This package adds bindings to the plugins system of XChat to Haskell.

  Only 2.8.8 version of XChat is supported.
  It builds some programe called hsxchat you can use to build
  your plugins.

  It is developped on a GNU/LINUX system,
   so don't expect it to work under Windows
   (although it should be quite easy to port).

  It is yet experimental, only the example given in
   the examples (AutoOp and CountDown) are known to work.

  I think all other features should also work,
   but there may be memory leaks, or performance issues.

  If you have patches to repair some bug or improve the design
   as well as some test files, I will be glad to have them
   (se?drikov@gm?ail.com without the question marks),
   but please don't send feature request or complains,
   since the code is not yet mature.

  Welcomed tests files are:
   plugins which should compile but don't
   plugins which leaks memory but shouldn't
   plugins which results in a segfault
   plugins which behave correctly (for regression tests)

  If your test is split in many files,
   please send a single archive file (for example a *.tgz)

  Yet I didn't even spent time to add strictness annotations
   or to hunt memory leaks due to my lack of relevant examples.
