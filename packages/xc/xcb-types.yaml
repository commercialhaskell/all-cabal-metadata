description: ! 'This package provides types which mirror the structures

  used in the XCB code generation XML files.


  See project http://xcb.freedesktop.org/ for more information about the XCB

  project.


  The XML files describe the data-types, events and requests used by the

  X Protocol, and are used to auto-generate large parts of the XCB project.


  This package parses these XML files into Haskell data structures.


  If you want to do something with these XML descriptions but don''t want

  to learn XSLT, this package should help.


  This version of xcb-types is intended to fully parse the X Protocol

  description version 1.4.'
