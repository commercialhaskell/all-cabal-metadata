  \n\n## Features\n\n* Left and right actions of\n  * sets\n  * semigroup\n  * monoids\n
  \ * groups\n* Semidirect product\n* Group torsors\n* Cyclic actions\n* Generated
  actions\n\n\n### Fine-grained class hierarchy\n\nLeft and right actions with a fine-grained
  class hierarchy for action properties. For left actions, here are the provided classes
  :\n\n``` haskell\nclass LAct               -- Set action\n => LActSg               --
  Semigroup action\n     => LActMn           -- Monoid action\n          => LTorsor
  \    -- Torsor\n => LActDistrib          -- Distributive action\n => LActNeutral
  \         -- Neutral preserving action\n => LActGen              -- Action generated
  by a set\n     => LActCyclic       -- Cyclic action (generated by a single element)\n\n```\n\n###
  Derive most of you action instances\n\nThe acting type is always the second parameter.
  Use this with `DerivingVia` language extension to derive action instances :\n\n```
  haskell\nimport Data.Act\nimport Data.Semigroup\n\nnewtype Seconds = Seconds Float\nnewtype
  Duration = Duration Seconds\n  deriving (Semigroup, Monoid) via (Sum Float)\n\n
  \ deriving (LAct Seconds, RAct Seconds) via (ActSelf' (Sum Float))\n  -- derives
  LAct Second  Duration\n\n  deriving (LAct [Seconds], RAct [Seconds]) via (ActMap
  (ActSelf' (Sum Float)))\n   -- derives LAct [Second] Duration\n\nnewtype Durations
  = Durations [Duration]\n  deriving (LAct Seconds, RAct Seconds) via (ActFold [Duration])\n
  \ -- derives LAct Second Durations\n\n```\n\n``` haskell\nghci> Duration 2 `lact`
  Seconds 3\nSeconds 5.0\n\nghci> Duration 2 `lact` [Seconds 3, Seconds 4]\n[Seconds
  5.0,Seconds 6.0]\n\nghci> [Duration 2, Duration 3] `lact` Seconds 4\n[Seconds 5.0,Seconds
  6.0]\n\nghci> Durations [Duration 2, Duration 3] `lact` Seconds 4\nSeconds 9.0\n```\n\n###
  Semidirect products\n\nThis fine-grained hierarchy allows to check for associativity
  and existence of neutral elements using _semidirect products_.\n\n``` haskell\n>>>
  import Data.Semigroup\n>>> LSemidirect (Sum 1) (Product 2) <> LSemidirect (Sum (3
  :: Int)) (Product (4 :: Int))\nLSemidirect {lactee = Sum {getSum = 7}, lactor =
  Product {getProduct = 8}}\n```\n\nGHC will complain when using a semigroup action
  that is not distributive :\n\n```haskell\n>>> LSemidirect (Sum 1) (Sum 2) <> LSemidirect
  (Sum (3 :: Int)) (Sum (4 :: Int))\nNo instance for `LActDistrib (Sum Int) (Sum Int)'\n
  \ arising from a use of `<>'\n```\n\n## Comparison with other action libraries\n\nHere
  is a list of action libraries on hackage :\n\n- [monoid-extra](https://github.com/diagrams/monoid-extras)\n-
  [acts](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/acts)\n- [semigroup-actions](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/semigroups-actions)\n-
  [raaz](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/raaz-0.0.1/docs/Raaz-Core-MonoidalAction.html)\n\n\nIn
  comparison with these libraries, `lr-acts`is the only library that :\n- Implements
  right actions\n- Implements cyclic actions and generated actions\n- Ensures the
  associativity and the neutrality of `mempty` in semidirect products\n- Proposes
  several newtypes for deriving instances (note that [acts](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/acts)
  proposes a deriving mechanism, but centered around the actee type, not the actor
  type as in this library)\n\nThe main drawback of providing right actions and checking
  properties for semidirect products is that the number of instances can quickly be
  overwhelming. It can be a lot of boiler plate to declare them all, especially when
  the acting semigroup is commutative.\n"
