  1.7.0
  ====

    * Removed some of conditional compilation, by no longer pretending that
    we provide `liftTyped` for `Matcher`.

    * Fixed yet another embarrassing parser bug (https://github.com/supki/aeson-match-qq/pull/33)

    * Implemented `[...]` and `{...}` as shortcuts to `_ : array` and `_ : object` respectively (https://github.com/supki/aeson-match-qq/pull/34)

    * Some work has been done on making match failures output understandable error messages (https://github.com/supki/aeson-match-qq/pull/37, https://github.com/supki/aeson-match-qq/pull/38, https://github.com/supki/aeson-match-qq/pull/39)

  1.6.1
  =====

    * Fixed another parser problem (https://github.com/supki/aeson-match-qq/pull/27)

  1.6.0
  =====

    * Clarified ans simplified API some more.

  1.5.3
  =====

    * Minuscule Haddock improvements

  1.5.2
  =====

    * Add `prettyError`, a pretty printer for `Error`s (https://github.com/supki/aeson-match-qq/pull/24)

  1.5.1
  =====

    * GHC 9.2 compatibility

  1.5.0
  =====

    * Streamlined API.

    * Sprinkled some CPP to support clients that have not been made compatible
      with Aeson 2.0 yet, so that they do not have to use a separate release (1.3.x)

  1.4.3
  =====

    * Improved matching errors for embedded Haskell values (https://github.com/supki/aeson-match-qq/pull/18)

    * Separate error types for type- and value- level mismatches (https://github.com/supki/aeson-match-qq/pull/18)

description: "aeson-match-qq\n==============\n\n[![Build status](https://circleci.com/gh/supki/aeson-match-qq.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/supki/aeson-match-qq)\n\nDeclarative
  JSON matchers.\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nWhen testing an HTTP service that spouts
  JSON documents, it's often inconvenient to write out the whole response as\nthe
  expected value.  Sometimes, you only care about a couple specific properties, or
  simply want to ensure that the\nresponse has certain structure.  This package provides
  a quasiquoter to define declarative matchers using a variation\nof the familiar
  syntax.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n### Basic JSON construction\n\nSince this package
  is heavily inspired by [aeson-qq][0], the parser tries to follow its behavior and
  has support for\noptional quotes for simple keys and the `#{exp}` syntax for Haskell
  expression interpolation. It currently does not support\nvariable keys though and
  there are no plans to add them.\n\n### Spread-like syntax for arrays and objects\n\nThis
  syntax allows you to match only the part of the structure you care about:\n\n`[match|
  [1, 2, 3, ...] |]` matches arrays starting with `[1, 2, 3]`  \n`[match| {foo: 1,
  bar: 2, ...} |]` matches objects that are supersets of `{foo: 1, bar: 2}`\n\n###
  Holes\n\nHoles are placeholders that match anything:\n\n`[match| _ |]` matches any
  JSON document  \n`[match| {foo: _} |]` matches any object that has the `foo` property.\n\nIf
  a hole is named, its value will be returned from `match`\n\n`[match| {foo: {bar:
  _n} |]` will return `{n: 4}` if matched with `{foo: {bar: 4}}`\n\n### Case-insensitive
  strings\n\nA small addition to the JSON syntax that allows string matches that ignore
  case:\n\n`[match| (ci) \"foo\" |]` matches any of `\"Foo\"`, `\"fOO\"`, or `\"FOO\"`.\n\n###
  Unordered arrays\n\nA small addition to the JSON syntax that allows array matches
  that ignore the order\nof the elements, for example:\n\n`[match| (unordered) [1,2,3]
  |]` matches `[3, 1, 2]`.\n\n  [0]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson-qq\n"
