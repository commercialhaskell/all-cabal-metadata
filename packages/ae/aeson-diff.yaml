  aeson-diff 1.1.0.5

      * Support GHC-8.4.x in recent Stackage releases.

  aeson-diff 1.1.0.4
      * Support GHC-8.4.x in recent Stackage releases.

  aeson-diff 1.1.0.4

      * Resolve name clash that prevents building against aeson>=1.2 in
        Stackage Nightly.

  aeson-diff 1.1.0.3

      * Relax upper bound on base dependency for Stackage LTS-9.

  aeson-diff 1.1.0.0

      * aeson-diff can now, optionally, generate a test operation before each
        remove.

      * Add '--test-before-remove' option to 'json-diff' command.

      * Add 'Config' type and 'diff'' to allow optional behaviours.

  aeson-diff 1.0.0.1

      * Remove the `patch'` function before anyone gets attached to it.

      * Remove the 'Value' which was carried by the 'Rem' operation constructor.

      * Move 'Pointer' and 'Patch' types and operations into separate modules.

  aeson-diff 1.0

      * aeson-diff now supports the operations and patch format described in
        RFC 6902.

      * The `patch` function now returns in the 'Result' monad from the aeson
        package.

      * Add a `patch'` function throws an exception instead.

      * The command line applications no longer pretend to support a non-JSON
        patch format.

  aeson-diff 0.1

      * Initial release.

  Aeson Diff
  ==========

  [![Build Status][badge]][status]
  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/aeson-diff.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson-diff)
  [![Hackage-Deps](https://img.shields.io/hackage-deps/v/aeson-diff.svg?maxAge=2592000)]()

  This is a small library for working with changes to JSON documents. It
  includes a library and two executables in the style of diff(1) and
  patch(1). Patches are themselves JSON Patch documents as specified in
  [RFC 6902][3].

  Installing
  ----------

  The `aeson-diff` package is written in Haskell and can be installed using the
  [Cabal][1] package management tool, [stack][2], or something similar.

  ````bash
  stack install aeson-diff
  ````

  The command-line tools can then be executed using stack:

  ````
  stack exec json-diff -- ....
  stack exec json-patch -- ....
  ````

  If you prefer to use Cabal, something like this might do the trick:

  ````bash
  cd aeson-diff/
  cabal sandbox init
  cabal install --dependencies-only
  cabal build
  sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
  sudo cp dist/build/json-*/json-{diff,patch} /usr/local/bin/
  ````

  Usage
  -----

  ### Patch format

  `aeson-diff` supports the JSON Patch format described in
  [RFC 6902][3].

  ### json-diff command

  The `json-diff` command compares two JSON documents and extracts a patch
  describing the differences between the first document and the second.

  ````
  Usage: json-diff [-T|--test-before-remove] [-o|--output OUTPUT] FROM TO
  Generate a patch between two JSON documents.

  Available options:
      -h,--help                Show this help text
      -T,--test-before-remove  Include a test before each remove.
      -o,--output OUTPUT       Write patch to file OUTPUT.
  ````

  ### json-patch command

  The `json-patch` command applies a patch describing changes to be made to
  a JSON document.

  ````
  Usage: json-patch [-o|--output OUTPUT] PATCH FROM
  Generate a patch between two JSON documents.

  Available options:
    -h,--help                Show this help text
    -o,--output OUTPUT       Destination for patched JSON.
    PATCH                    Patch to apply.
    FROM                     JSON file to patch.
  ````

  ### aeson-diff library

  The `aeson-diff` library exports as single module: `Data.Aeson.Diff`. This
  exports `diff` and `patch` functions which do exactly what might be expected:

  - `diff :: Value -> Value -> Patch` examines source and target JSON `Value`s
  and constructs a new `Patch` describing the changes.

  - `patch :: Patch -> Value -> Result Value` applies the changes in a `Patch` to a JSON
  `Value`. If an error results then an exception is thrown.

  For more complete information, see the [documentation][docs].
