description: |-
  AERN-Net provides
  datatypes and abstractions for defining and executing
  networks of communicating processes.  These networks have a fixed
  topology, which can be infinite via recursion.
  The communication on each channel is driven by
  some query-response protocol.  Basic protocols
  for communicating approximations of real numbers and
  functions are provided together with protocol combinators
  eg for communicating value pairs or lists
  and communicating with additional query parameters
  or with optimised repetitions.

  An class-based abstraction is provided to make it possible
  to execute networks on various distributed backends without modification.
  At the moment there is only one backend, which is not distributed.
  It is envisaged that truly distributed backends will be added soon,
  eg based on plain TCP, MPI or REST/SOAP Web services.

  A mathematical foundation of these networks is described
  in the draft
  paper <http://www-users.aston.ac.uk/~konecnym/papers/ernets08-draft.html>.

  Simple examples of usage can be found in modules @DemoMax@ and @DemoSqrt@
  in folder @examples@.
