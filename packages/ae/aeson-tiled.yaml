  # aeson-tiled

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/aeson-tiled.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson-tiled)

  Types and instances for [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) map editor `.tmj` files.

  > `aeson-tiled` is the spiritual successor to `htiled`.
  > `htiled` uses `hxt` which relies too heavily on Arrows and is rather hard to work with.
  > Tiled's json export supports 100% of Tiled's features, so there doesn't seem to be much of a point to maintaining a large Arrows-based project when writing Aeson instances for Tiled types is much easier.
  > Hence this project!
