  `aeson-tiled` is the spiritual successor to `htiled`. `htiled` uses `hxt` which
  relies

  too heavily on Arrows and is rather hard to work with. Tiled''s json export

  supports 100% of Tiled''s features, so there doesn''t seem to be much of a

  point to maintaining a large Arrows-based project when writing Aeson instances

  for Tiled types is much easier. Hence this project!
