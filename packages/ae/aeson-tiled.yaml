  ## [0.0.2.2] - 2022-12-24

  - Fixed bits and flags in Data.Tiled.GID.
  - Added tile flag packing and unpacking into Word8/32.

  ## [0.0.2.1] - 2022-08-09

  - Fixed `firstgid` field name in embedded tilesets.
  - Minimal `aeson` version is actually 2.0 (due to `KeyMap`).

  # aeson-tiled

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/aeson-tiled.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson-tiled)

  Types and instances for [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) map editor map/`.tmj` and tileset/`.tsj` files.

  > `aeson-tiled` is the spiritual successor to `htiled`.
  > `htiled` uses `hxt` which relies too heavily on Arrows and is rather hard to work with.
  > Tiled's json export supports 100% of Tiled's features, so there doesn't seem to be much of a point to maintaining a large Arrows-based project when writing Aeson instances for Tiled types is much easier.
  > Hence this project!

  The package is geared toward minimal divergence from Tiled type specifications.

  Tiled data format is taken at version 1.8.4.
  Should be compatible down to 1.6 (where the `version` field changed to string).

  GHC versions are supported from 8.10 and follow Stackage LTS + Stackage Nightly + whatever is available on `ghcup`.

  ## Module structure

  The modules are designed for qualified imports and `OverloadedRecordDot` extension.
  Everyone has a `Generic` instance so you can use `generic-lens` or `generic-optics` if you wish.

  - Modules under `Codec.Tiled.*` are concerned with `aeson` representation, one type at a time.
    They provide JSON `Value` translation to concrete types, but not much beyond that.
    Your application most likely should use its own representation.
  - Modules under `Data.Tiled.*` are types specific to this package.
    They are more refined and may be utilized directly.
