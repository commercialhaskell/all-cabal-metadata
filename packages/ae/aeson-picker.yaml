  Tiny library to get fields from JSON format

  Common use is the following:
  ```
  JSON |-- FIELDS :: EXPECTED TYPE
  Text |-- [Text] :: a
  ```
  So operator `(|--)` gets JSON (represented as `Text`), "route" to field inside JSON (represented as `[Text]`), and tries to parse field from JSON with described route to expected type.
  If expected type can be deduced with type checker then it can be dropped down.

  A little bit safer operator is `(|-?)`. It returns not `a` but `Maybe a`.

  ## Examples
  First, add extension (to not pack `String` to `Text` every time):
  ```
  ghci>:set -XOverloadedStrings
  ```

  Then you can try something simple (empty list means that you try to parse `Value` from the top JSON-level):
  ```
  ghci>"5" |-- [] :: Int
  5
  ghci>"5" |-- [] :: Float
  5.0
  ghci>"5" |-- [] :: String
  "*** Exception: Data.Aeson.Picker: could not pick field with path: []
  ```

  But what if field you are looking for somewhere inside JSON?
  That's why are you here.

  Let's try to get something from inside JSON:
  ```
  ghci>"{\"a\": 5}" |-- ["a"] :: Int
  5
  ```
  But be sure that the field is presented inside JSON:
  ```
  ghci>"{\"a\": 5}" |-- ["b"] :: Int
  *** Exception: Data.Aeson.Picker: could not pick field with path: ["b"]
  ```
  We can go deeper (as deep as you want):
  ```
  ghci>"{\"outer\": {\"inner\": [1,2,3]}}" |-- ["outer", "inner"] :: [Int]
  [1,2,3]
  ```
  But be sure that you JSON is really valid (by specification key in JSON should be `String`):
  ```
  ghci>"{a: 5}" |-- ["a"] :: Int
  *** Exception: Data.Aeson.Picker: input json is not valid
  ```

  If you want more "safe" picker, you can use another operator:
  ```
  ghci>"5" |-? [] :: Maybe Int
  Just 5
  ghci>"{\"a\": 5}" |-? ["a"] :: Maybe Int
  Just 5
  ghci>"{\"a\": 5}" |-? ["b"] :: Maybe Int
  Nothing
  ```

  In current logic even operator `(|-?)` will throw error if JSON is not valid:
  ```
  ghci>"{a: 5}" |-? ["a"] :: Maybe Int
  *** Exception: Data.Aeson.Picker: input json is not valid
  ```

  You can open issue if you do not think that it is right logic.
