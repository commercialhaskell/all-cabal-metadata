changelog: "0.5.0.1: 29 July 2009: renamed \"demos\" fodler to \"examples\"\n0.5.0:
  28 July 2009\n    * Made the testing harness more generic so that it can be used\n
  \     for any base.  Also a readable report is produced for each\n      tested property
  with statistics for timing and precision.\n    * New support for anti-consistent
  function enclosures and twin arithmetic\n      (analogous to directed/improper intervals
  such as [2,0] and\n       outer+inner rounded Kaucher arithmetic over them).\n    *
  Fixed many bugs.\n    * Improved precision of enclosure comparison.\n\n0.4.9.1:
  24 February 2009: fixed errors in haddoc comments\n0.4.9: 23 February 2009\n    *
  Added a quickcheck testing harness for the polynomial arithmetic core.\n    * Rewritten
  polynomial arithmetic core.\n    * Fixed many rounding errors affecting almost all
  operations.\n    * New operation: substitution into an enclosure of a *monotone*
  function.\n    * In enclosure arithmetic, now can set a limit on the size of each
  enclosure representation.\n      This is important for many-variate polynomials
  that tend to have very many terms.\n0.4.2: 1 December 2008\n    * substantially
  improved division by a constant PFE (polynomial function enclosure)\n    * added
  proper handling of overflown coefficients\n0.4.1: 30 September 2008\n    * updated
  to work with AERN-Real 0.9.7    \n0.4: 20 August 2008\n    * fixed several serious
  bugs in sin and cos\n    * added arctan\n0.3.0.3: 7 August 2008\n    * revamped
  package description to make it much shorter and linked it\n      to the main module\n0.3.0.2:
  7 August 2008\n    * deleted irrelevant/confusing text from package description\n0.3.0.1:
  7 August 2008\n    * fixed markup in package description\n0.3.0: 7 August 2008\n
  \   * initial release of AERN-RnToRm after one year of work and two successful \n
  \     internal applications\n    \n"

description: |-
  AERN-RnToRm provides
  datatypes and abstractions for approximating functions
  of type @D -> R^m@ where @D@ is a bounded interval in @R^n@
  with non-empty interior.

  The main datatype are function enclosures whose boundaries are
  piece-wise polynomial with a bounded degree.  (This degree can
  be set arbitrarily high or as low as 0.)
  This datatype is supported by safely rounding operations
  whose precision can be increased arbitrarily, so that they
  all converge to the exact operations.
  Field operations, integration, maximisation and some elementary operations
  (namely exp, sin, cos) are among those already implemented.

  For an architectural overview, see module "Data.Number.ER.RnToRm".

  A mathematical description of the very basics as well as a brief comparison
  with Taylor Models is included in the
  paper <http://www-users.aston.ac.uk/~konecnym/papers/cfv08.html>.

  Simple examples of usage can be found in folder @examples@
  and a test suite can be run via the module in the folder @tests@.
