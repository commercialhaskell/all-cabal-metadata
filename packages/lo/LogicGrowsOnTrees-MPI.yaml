  * Exposed `getCurentStatistics` in the `RequestQueueMonad`, allowing one to
    obtain the statistics at any time during the run.

  * Fixed the documentation.

  * Now ImplicitParams are used instead of a monad to ensure sockets
    initialization.

  * Fixed bug where MPI was not geting initialized.

  (The package unfortunately cannot be built on the Hackage server because
  MPI is not installed on it.)

  This package provides a adapter for the LogicGrowsOnTrees package that uses
  MPI for parallelism. See the module documentation for more details.

  NOTE:  You need to have an MPI implementation installed to use the package;
  no thread support is required, and it only uses very simple
  functionality so MPI 1.0 or 1.1 should suffice. Also, @mpi.h@ needs
  to be in the include path and a library named @mpi@ (@libmpi@ in
  unix) in the library path; if these files are not in their respective
  paths, you can add their directories to their respective search paths
  for this package by using Cabal's respective
  @--extra-include-dirs=...@ and @--extra-lib-dirs=...@ options.
