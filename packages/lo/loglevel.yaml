  # Log Level Datatype

  This package provides a Haskell log-level datatype. It allows to specify APIs
  with logging-callbacks without depending on a particular logging framework.

  There is a large number of different Haskell logging frameworks that support
  different use cases and backends. As a consequence these framework make
  different trade-offs with respect to their architecture and implementation.
  Often they have complex internals and many external dependencies.

  While logging frameworks differ a lot in their internals and backends, they tend
  to have similar frontends. In particular, many software components depend for
  logging only on a callback function that typically has a type similar to

  ```haskell
  loggingCallback ∷ LogLevel → Text → IO ()
  ```

  The only framework-specific dependency is the `LogLevel` type. This type is in
  most cases similar, often isomorphic, and sometimes even identical across
  different frameworks.

  It is unfortunate that a software component has to depend on a particular
  logging framework (and all of the frameworks dependencies) just for using the
  `LogLevel` type that is almost identical throughout most logging frameworks.

  This package allows software components to include logging callbacks in their
  APIs without depending on a particular logging framework.

  ---

  Even more complex logging callbacks often have a type along the lines of

  ```haskell
  genericLoggingCallback ∷ c a ⇒ LogLevel → a → IO ()
  ```

  where `c` is a constraint made up from common type classes like `ToJSON`,
  `Serializable`, `NFData`, or `Generic`.
