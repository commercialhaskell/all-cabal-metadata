description: ! '@logging@ is a wrapper around @fast-logger@ which makes

  it easy to log from ''IO''. It provides the following conveniences on top of

  those libraries:


  - A set of shorter functions to type: ''debug'', ''log'', ''warn'', plus others

  that flush after each message, or which allow providing a message source

  string.


  - Logging variants of ''error'', ''trace'' and ''traceShow'', called ''errorL'',

  ''traceL'' and ''traceShowL''.  These use ''unsafePerformIO'' in order to act as

  direct replacements, so the usual caveats apply.


  - A global function, ''setDebugLevel'', which uses a global ''IORef'' to record

  the logging level, saving you from having to carry around the notion of

  "verbosity level" in a Reader environment.


  - A set of "timed" variants, ''timedLog'' and ''timedDebug'', which report how

  long the specified action took to execute in wall-clock time.'
