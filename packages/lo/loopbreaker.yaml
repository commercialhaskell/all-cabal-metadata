  # loopbreaker

  Performance of libraries like [polysemy](https://github.com/polysemy-research/polysemy)
  depends on code being aggresively inlined. Problem is that GHC is not very
  keen on inlining self-recursive definitions. Luckily, there's a way we can
  trick compiler to do so: by introducing intermediate _loopbreaker_ that simply
  calls our original function:
  ```
  fact :: Int -> Int
  fact 0 = 1
  fact n = n * fact' (n - 1)
  {-# INLINE fact #-}

  fact' :: Int -> Int
  fact' = fact
  {-# NOINLINE fact' #-}
  ```
  But because this is ugly boilerplate nobody wants to write, we created GHC
  plugin that searches for such recursive definitions and automatically inserts
  loopbreakers during compilation.

  To quote [isovector](https://github.com/isovector):
  > As described in [Writing Custom Optimization Passes](https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/writing-custom-optimizations/),
  The `polysemy-plugin` has had support for creating explicit loopbreakers for
  self-recursive functions. The result is pretty dramatic code improvements in a
  lot of cases when `-O2` is turned on.

  > Rather embarrassingly, after publishing that post, it turned out that my
  implementation didn't in fact improve optimizations. Sure, it spit out the
  correct code, but it was being done too late, and some special analysis passes
  had already run. The result: we'd generate loopbreakers, but they wouldn't be
  used.

  > [TheMatten](https://github.com/TheMatten) took it upon himself to fix this.
  There's no trick --- just do the same transformations after renaming, rather
  than after typechecking. We realized this plugin is useful outside of
  polysemy, so it's been released as a standalone package.

  ## Usage

  Add `-fplugin=Loopbreaker` into your `package.yaml` or specific module. This
  will cause the plugin to generate explicit loopbreakers for any self-recursive
  functions marked as `INLINE`, which can dramatically improve their
  performance. See documentation for more info.
