  The package name *loc* stands for “location” and is
  also an allusion to the acronym for “lines of code”.

  Overview of the concepts:

  ![Example text illustrating Loc, Span, and Area](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chris-martin/haskell-libraries/4be81df645d4a2e5073f45563930e202e41209c7/loc/example.png)

  * `Loc` - a cursor position, starting at the origin `1:1`
  * `Span` - a nonempty contiguous region between two locs
  * `Area` - a set of zero or more spans with gaps between them

  See also:

  * [loc-test](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/loc-test) -
    Test-related utilities for this package.

  ## `Pos`

  Since all of the numbers we're dealing with in this domain are positive, we
  define a "positive integer" type. This is a newtype for `Natural` that doesn't
  allow zero.

  ```haskell
  newtype Pos = Pos Natural
    deriving (Eq, Ord)

  instance Num Pos where
    fromInteger = Pos . checkForUnderflow . fromInteger
    Pos x + Pos y = Pos (x + y)
    Pos x - Pos y = Pos (checkForUnderflow (x - y))
    Pos x * Pos y = Pos (x * y)
    abs = id
    signum _ = Pos 1
    negate _ = throw Underflow

  checkForUnderflow :: Natural -> Natural
  checkForUnderflow n =
    if n == 0 then throw Underflow else n
  ```

  `Pos` does not have an `Integral` instance, because that would require
  implementing `quotRem :: Pos -> Pos -> (Pos, Pos)`, which doesn't make much
  sense. Therefore we can't use `toInteger` on `Pos`. Instead we use our own
  `ToNat` class to convert positive numbers to natural numbers.

  ```haskell
  class ToNat a where
    toNat :: a -> Natural

  instance ToNat Pos where
    toNat (Pos n) = n
  ```

  ## `Line`, `Column`

  We then add some newtypes to be more specific about whether we're talking about
  line or column numbers.

  ```haskell
  newtype Line = Line Pos
    deriving (Eq, Ord, Num, Real, Enum, ToNat)

  newtype Column = Column Pos
    deriving (Eq, Ord, Num, Real, Enum, ToNat)
  ```

  ## `Loc`

  A `Loc` is a `Line` and a `Column`.

  ```haskell
  data Loc = Loc
    { line   :: Line
    , column :: Column
    }
    deriving (Eq, Ord)
  ```

  Note that this library has chosen to be remain entirely agnostic of the text
  that the positions are referring to. Therefore there is no "plus one" operation
  on `Loc`, because the next `Loc` after *4:17* could be either *4:18* or *5:1* -
  we can't tell without knowing the line lengths.

  ## `Span`

  A `Span` is a start `Loc` and an end `Loc`.

  ```haskell
  data Span = Span
    { start :: Loc
    , end   :: Loc
    } deriving (Eq, Ord)
  ```

  A `Span` is not allowed to be empty; in other words, `start` and `end` must be
  different.

  There are two functions for constructing a `Span`. They both reorder their
  arguments as appropriate to make sure the start comes before the end (so that
  spans are never backwards). They take different approaches to ensuring that
  spans are never empty: the first can throw an exception, whereas the second is
  typed as `Maybe`.

  ```haskell
  fromTo :: Loc -> Loc -> Span
  fromTo a b =
    maybe (throw EmptySpan) id (fromToMay a b)

  fromToMay :: Loc -> Loc -> Maybe Span
  fromToMay a b =
    case compare a b of
      LT -> Just (Span a b)
      GT -> Just (Span b a)
      EQ -> Nothing
  ```

  The choice to use an exclusive upper bound *\[start, end)* rather than two
  inclusive bounds *\[start, end\]* is forced by the decision to be text-agnostic.
  With inclusive ranges, you couldn't tell whether span *4:16-4:17* abuts span
  *5:1-5:2* without knowing whether the character at position *4:17* is a newline.

  ## `Area`

  Conceptually, an area is a set of spans. To support efficient union and
  difference operations, `Area` is defined like this:

  ```haskell
  data Terminus = Start | End
    deriving (Eq, Ord)

  newtype Area = Area (Map Loc Terminus)
    deriving (Eq, Ord)
  ```

  You can think of this as a sorted list of the spans' start and end positions,
  along with a tag indicating whether each is a start or an end.

  ## `Show`

  We define custom `Show` and `Read` instances to be able to write terse tests like:

  ```haskell
  >>> addSpan (read "1:1-6:1") (read "[1:1-3:1,6:1-6:2,7:4-7:5]")
  [1:1-6:2,7:4-7:5]
  ```

  These are the `showsPrec` implementations for `Loc` and `Span`:

  ```haskell
  locShowsPrec :: Int -> Loc -> ShowS
  locShowsPrec _ (Loc l c) =
    shows l .
    showString ":" .
    shows c

  spanShowsPrec :: Int -> Span -> ShowS
  spanShowsPrec _ (Span a b) =
    locShowsPrec 10 a .
    showString "-" .
    locShowsPrec 10 b
  ```

  ## `Read`

  The parser for `Pos` is based on the parser for `Natural`, applying `mfilter (/=
  0)` to make the parser fail if the input represents a zero.

  ```haskell
  posReadPrec :: ReadPrec Pos
  posReadPrec =
    Pos <$> mfilter (/= 0) readPrec
  ```

  As a reminder, the type of `mfilter` is:

  ```haskell
  mfilter :: MonadPlus m => (a -> Bool) -> m a -> m a
  ```

  The `Loc` parser uses a very typical `Applicative` pattern:

  ```haskell
  -- | Parses a single specific character.
  readPrecChar :: Char -> ReadPrec ()
  readPrecChar = void . readP_to_Prec . const . ReadP.char

  locReadPrec :: ReadPrec Loc
  locReadPrec =
    Loc              <$>
    readPrec         <*
    readPrecChar ':' <*>
    readPrec
  ```

  We used `mfilter` above to introduce failure into the `Pos` parser; for `Span`
  we use `empty`.

  ```haskell
  empty :: Alternative f => f a
  ```

  First we use `fromToMay` to produce a `Maybe Span`, and then in the case where
  the result is `Nothing` we use `empty` to make the parser fail.

  ```haskell
  spanReadPrec :: ReadPrec Span
  spanReadPrec =
    locReadPrec      >>= \a ->
    readPrecChar '-' *>
    locReadPrec      >>= \b ->
    maybe empty pure (fromToMay a b)
  ```

  ## Comparison to similar packages

  ### `srcloc`

  [srcloc](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/srcloc) has a similar general
  purpose: defining types related to positions in text files.

  Some differences:

  * `srcloc`'s `Pos` type (comparable to our `Loc` type) has a `FilePath`
    parameter, whereas this library doesn't consider file paths at all.
  * `srcloc` has nothing comparable to the `Area` type.

  There are some undocumented aspects of `srcloc` we find confusing:

  * What does "character offset" mean?
  * Does `srcloc`'s `Loc` type use inclusive or exclusive bounds?
