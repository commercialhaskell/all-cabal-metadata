  # 0.8.1.0

  * Add `instance MonadLogic (Control.Monad.Writer.CPS.WriterT w m)`.

  # 0.8.0.0

  * Breaking change:
    do not re-export `Control.Monad` and `Control.Monad.Trans` from `Control.Monad.Logic`.
  * Generalize `instance Traversable (LogicT Identity)`
    to `instance (Traversable m, Monad m) => Traversable (LogicT m)`.
  * Add conversion functions `fromLogicT` and `fromLogicTWith` to facilitate
    interoperation with [`list-t`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/list-t)
    and [`logict-sequence`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/logict-sequence) packages.
  * Add `hoistLogicT` and `embedLogicT` to convert `LogicT` computations
    from one underlying monad to another.

  # 0.7.1.0

  * Improve documentation.
  * Breaking change:
    relax superclasses of `MonadLogic` to `Monad` and `Alternative` instead of `MonadPlus`.

  # 0.7.0.3

  * Support GHC 9.0.

  # 0.7.0.2

  * Add `Safe` pragmas.

  # 0.7.0.1

  * Fix `MonadReader r (LogicT m)` instance again.

  # 0.7.0.0

  * Remove unlawful `MonadLogic (Writer T w m)` instances.
  * Fix `MonadReader r (LogicT m)` instance.
  * Move `lnot` into `MonadLogic` class.

  # 0.6.0.3

  * Comply with MonadFail proposal.

  # logict [![Build Status](https://github.com/Bodigrim/logict/workflows/Haskell-CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Bodigrim/logict/actions?query=workflow%3AHaskell-CI) [![Hackage](http://img.shields.io/hackage/v/logict.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/logict) [![Stackage LTS](http://stackage.org/package/logict/badge/lts)](http://stackage.org/lts/package/logict) [![Stackage Nightly](http://stackage.org/package/logict/badge/nightly)](http://stackage.org/nightly/package/logict)

  Provides support for logic-based evaluation.  Logic-based programming
  uses a technique known as backtracking to consider alternative values
  as solutions to logic statements, and is exemplified by languages
  such as [Prolog](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) and
  [Datalog](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog).

  Logic-based programming replaces explicit iteration and sequencing
  code with implicit functionality that internally "iterates" (via
  backtracking) over a set of possible values that satisfy explicitly
  provided conditions.

  This package adds support for logic-based programming in Haskell using
  the continuation-based techniques adapted from the paper
  [Backtracking, Interleaving, and Terminating Monad Transformers](http://okmij.org/ftp/papers/LogicT.pdf)
  by Oleg Kiselyov, Chung-chieh Shan, Daniel P. Friedman, Amr Sabry.
  This paper extends previous research into using `MonadPlus`
  functionality—where `mplus` is used to specify value alternatives
  for consideration and `mzero` use used to specify the lack of any
  acceptable values—to add support for fairness and pruning using a
  set of operations defined by a new `MonadLogic` class.

  # Background

  In a typical example for Prolog logic programming, there are a set of
  facts (expressed as unconditional statements):

  ```prolog
  parent(sarah, john).
  parent(arnold, john).
  parent(john, anne).
  ```

  and a set of rules that apply if their conditions (body clause) are satisfied:

  ```prolog
  grandparent(Person, Grandchild) :- parent(Person, X), parent(X, Grandchild).
  ```

  Execution of a query for this rule `grandparent(G, anne)` would result in the following "values":

  ```prolog
  grandparent(sarah, anne).
  grandparent(arnold, anne).
  ```

  For this query execution, `Person` and `X` are "free" variables where
  `Grandchild` has been fixed to `anne`. The Prolog engine internally
  "backtracks" to the `parent(Person, X)` statement to try different
  known values for each variable, executing forward to see if the values
  satisfy all the results and produce a resulting value.

  # Haskell logict Package

  The Haskell equivalent for the example above, using the `logict` package
  might look something like the following:

  ```haskell
  import Control.Applicative
  import Control.Monad.Logic

  parents :: [ (String, String) ]
  parents = [ ("Sarah",  "John")
            , ("Arnold", "John")
            , ("John",   "Anne")
            ]

  grandparent :: String -> Logic String
  grandparent grandchild = do (p, c) <- choose parents
                              (c', g) <- choose parents
                              guard (c == c')
                              guard (g == grandchild)
                              pure p

  choose = foldr ((<|>) . pure) empty

  main = do let grandparents = observeAll (grandparent "Anne")
            putStrLn $ "Anne's grandparents are: " <> show grandparents
  ```

  In this simple example, each of the `choose` calls acts as a
  backtracking choice point where different entries of the `parents`
  array will be generated.  This backtracking is handled automatically
  by the `MonadLogic` instance for `Logic` and does not need to be
  explicitly written into the code.  The `observeAll` function collects
  all the values "produced" by `Logic`, allowing this program to
  display:

  ```
  Anne's grandparents are: ["Sarah","Arnold"]
  ```

  This example is provided as the `grandparents` executable built by the
  `logict` package so you can run it yourself and try various
  experimental modifications.

  The example above is very simplistic and is just a brief introduction
  into the capabilities of logic programming and the `logict` package.
  The `logict` package provides additional functionality such as:

   * Fair conjunction and disjunction, which can help with potentially
     infinite sets of inputs.

   * A `LogicT` monad stack that lets logic operations be performed
     along with other monadic actions (e.g. if the parents sample was
     streamed from an input file using the `IO` monad).

   * A `MonadLogic` class which allows other monads to be defined which
     provide logic programming capabilities.

  ## Additional Notes

  The implementation in this `logict` package provides the backtracking
  functionality at a lower level than that defined in the associated
  paper.  The backtracking is defined within the `Alternative` class as
  `<|>` and `empty`, whereas the paper uses the `MonadPlus` class and
  the `mplus` and `mzero` functions; since `Alternative` is a
  requirement (constraint) for `MonadPlus`, this allows both
  nomenclatures to be supported and used as appropriate to the client
  code.

  More details on using this package as well as other functions
  (including fair conjunction and disjunction) are provided in the
  [Haddock documentation](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/logict).
