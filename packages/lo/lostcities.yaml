description: "Lost Cities\n-----------\n\nThis is an implementation of a short two-player
  card game\nin Haskell using the wxWidgets GUI toolkit.\nThis program allows you
  to play against a computer AI using\na minimax algorithm with alpha-beta prunning
  (based on\nBird and Wadler's presentation in the \"Introduction\nto Functional Programming\").
  \n\nThe game is played with a deck of cards numbered from 2 to 10\nin 5 colors plus
  3 \"investment\" cards for each color (marked with a \nmultiplication sign). The
  game progressed by playing cards\nin columns of same colors of increasing value
  (\"expeditions\"); \nstarting a new expedition costs -20 points and the played\ncards
  are summed; the investment cards multiply the result\n(positive or negative).\n\nCrucially,
  the computer AI does not \"cheat\": unknown information\n(i.e., the opponents hand
  and draw deck) is hidden\nby considering possible scenarios that are compatible\nwith
  the known information. It seems to play only moderately well,\nbut still better
  than some online AI opponents I tried.\n\n\nFor more details check the Boardgamegeek
