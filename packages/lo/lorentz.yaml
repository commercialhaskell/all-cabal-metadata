  ======
  * [!1370](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1370)
    Add `OverloadedRecordDot` support for Lorentz `StoreClass`
    + Deprecated `StoreClass.Extra`, as it does more or less the same thing as
      `OverloadedRecordDot`, but a lot worse.
  * [!1369](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1369)
    Add `IsLabel` and `Default` instances for `EntrypointRef`
    + Now `OverloadedLabels` can be used instead of `Call`
    + `def` from `Data.Default` can be used instead of `CallDefault`

    Add support for bytes to nat and int conversions
    + Support `nat` and `bytes` instructions, and the new operands to `int`
      instruction.
  * [!1331](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1331)
    Support implicit account tickets
    + Allow tickets as parameter to `ImplicitAddress` in `ToTAddress`;
  * [!1328](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1328)
    Kill support for TORUs, minimal sr1 address support, tz4 address support

  * [!1314](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1314)
    Preserve docs after failWith
  * [!1289](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1289)
    Simplify/fix ReferencedByName
    + `dupL` and `dupLNamed` could under some specific circumstances crash at
      runtime due to not-always-valid unsafe coercions. The unsafe coercions have
      been removed.
  * [!1235](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1235)
    Make it easier to have consistent field naming between HasAnnotation and
    TypeHasDoc
    + Require newly introduced `TypeHasFieldNamingStrategy` constraint in the
    default implementation `annOptions`. Apply the strategy as appropriate.
    + Add an optional field to `typeDoc` which allows specifying the strategy.
    + See also the corresponding `morley` changelog.

  0.15.0
  ======
  * [!1273](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1273)
    Add LAMBDA_REC and Lambda_rec support
    + `framed` instruction moved to `Lorentz.Instr.Framed` (re-exported from
      `Lorentz.Instr`).
    + `IsoValue` and `HasAnnotation` instances for `(:->)` are replaced with
      type-errored ones, as Lorentz code is no longer isomorphic to lambdas.
    + `TypeHasDoc` instance for `(:->)` removed.
    + `WrappedLambda` is now a sum datatype.
    + `unWrappedLambda` removed, as recursive lambdas can't be unwrapped like
      that.
    + All lambda-related instances moved to `Lorentz.Lambda`.
    + `lambdaRec` instruction introduced.
    + `mkLambdaRec` helper for constructing recursive lambda values introduced.
  * [!1278](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1278)
    Deprecate timelock-related functions
  * [!1270](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1270)
    Add lima protocol TICKET instruction, rename old one to TICKET_DEPRECATED
    + The `TICKET` instruction was renamed to `TICKET_DEPRECATED`
    + A new `TICKET` instruction was added which no longer allows zero amount
      tickets. It now returns `Some Ticket` and `None` in case of zero amount
      supplied.
  * [!1267](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1267)
    Added Lorentz.ADT doctests examples / tests
  * [!1271](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1271)
    Miscellaneous chores
    + Add Buildable instances for `ZippedStackRepr` and `ZSNil`.
    + Export `DupT` and `DipT` classes from `Lorentz.Referenced`.
  * [!1252](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1252)
    Better errors on stuck GetEntrypointArgCustom
  * [!1233](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1233)
    Rename Lorentz.Rebinded to Lorentz.Rebound
  * [!1242](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1242)
    Use `Constrained` utility existential
  * [!1180](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1180)
    Implement lmap for more types, and change signature of the typeclass to
    be more pure.
  * [!1178](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1178)
    Add `HasNoNestedBigMaps t` constraint where required.
    + These constraint were missing on TZIP-16 views, but effectively it is
      required by the network for callbacks. This is a consequence of adding this
      constraint to `Contract t` in Morley.
  * [!1222](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1222)
    Change the constraints on `constructStack` and `deconstruct` in
    `Lorentz.ADT`, and on `documentEntrypoints` in `Lorentz.Entrypoints.Doc`.
    Code using them in surprisingly polymorphic ways may need minor adjustments.
    Applications of these functions should now be faster to typecheck and also
    faster to run.
  * [!1216](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1216)
    Remove `KnownList` constraints from `euclidExtendedNormalization` and
    `reduceRationalHelper` in `Lorentz.CustomArith.RationalArith`.
  * [!1198](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1198)
    Implement `dipT` using `dipN` for performance. This change also allows
    `dipT` to be used without an explicit type argument when enough is known
    about the passed stack action. Do the same for `dupT`, using `dupN`.

  0.14.1
  ======
  * [!1214](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1214)
    Add emit instructions
  * [!1202](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1202)
    Make type errors less confusing when types are ambiguous
  * [!1177](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1177)
    Distinguish implicit/contract aliases and addresses on the type level
  * [!1136](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1136)
    Add `idiv` and `imod` macros to Lorentz.
  * [!1181](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1181)
    Add a few missing instances
    + `CanCastTo` instances for `ZippedStackRepr` and `WrappedLambda`,
    + `Generic` and `MapLorentzInstr` instances for `WrappedLambda`,
    + `HasAnnotation` instances for `ZippedStackRepr`.

  0.14.0
  ======
  * [!1123](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1123)
    Remove deprecated exports
  * [!1169](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1169)
    Support MIN_BLOCK_TIME instruction
    + Add the corresponding Lorentz `minBlockTime` instruction.
  * [!1158](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1158)
    Refactor (out) annotation checking support
    + `iWithVarAnnotations` removed.
    + Initial cast in lorentz contracts is redundant since annotations are
      ignored, hence it is removed.
    + Hence, `coDisableInitialCast` and `coDisableInitialCastL` are removed.
  * [!1163](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1163)
    Prohibit some operations in views
    + `ContractCode` is now a newtype wrapper instead of type synonym; this is
      required to avoid accidentally pasting contract code in views.
    + Lorentz lambdas are now newtype-wrapped with `WrappedLambda`, for the same
      reason.
    + `Lambda` is a type synonym for `WrappedLambda` with singleton input and
      output stacks.
    + The old `Lambda` synonym (which was a sequence of instructions with
      singleton i/o stacks) is renamed to `Fn`.
    + New "smart" constructors, `mkContractCode` and `mkLambda`, which conjure the
      required constraints.
  * [!1153](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1153)
    Remove 'OpSize' module.
  * [!1114](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1114)
    Update to ghc-9.0.2
  * [!1108](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1108)
    Remove support for the deprecated morley extensions
  * [!1007](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1007)
    Add `Rational` datatype in Lorentz and arithmetic operations with it
    + Move all custom arithmetics in Lorentz the a separate module
  * [!1146](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1146)
    Optimize `lmap` for `Maybe`.
  * [!1111](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1111)
    Add `errorDocArg`, deprecate `errorDoc`
    + Added `errorDocArg`, a quasi-quoter replacing `errorDoc`. The main
      difference is `errorDocArg` allows optionally specifying the error
      argument type.
    + Since `errorDocArg` subsumes `errorDoc`, the latter is deprecated.

  0.13.4
  ======
  * [!1078](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1078)
    Option to flatten EpdRecursive entrypoints in autodoc
    + New entrypoint kind `FlattenedEntrypointsKindHiding`, which flattens
      entrypoints in autodoc and allows hiding specific constructors. For other
      intents it's the same as `PlainEntrypointsKind`.
    + Convenience synonym `FlattenedEntrypointsKind` for cases where no hiding
      is necessary.
    + New convenience functions `entryCaseFlattened` and
      `entryCaseFlattenedHiding`.
    + Deprecate redundant `constructDEpArg`, use `mkDEntrypointArgSimple` instead.
  * [!1104](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1104)
    Use clearer notation for (-$)
    + Introduce new data types `ZippedStackRepr a b = a ::: b`
      and `ZSNil = ZSNil`, isomorphic to '(a, b)' and '()' respectively,
      to represent a zipped stack.
  * [!1082](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1082)
    Fix/drop/comment noncanonical Show instances
  * [!841](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/841)
    Make entrypoints derivation work with void-like entrypoint arguments.

  0.13.3
  ======
  * [!1100](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1100)
    Support `map` instruction over `Maybe` (a.k.a. `option`)
    + Add `instance MapOpHs (Maybe e)`
  * [!1084](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1084)
    Switch to the new mutez subtraction operation
  * [!1101](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1101)
    Export `sopSetField` and `sopGetField` from `Lorentz.StoreClass`
  * [!1089](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1089)
    Enhance and rename mutez quasiquote
    + Export `tz` quasiquoter from `Lorentz.Value` and `Lorentz`.
  * [!1071](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1071)
    Add `HasRPCRepr` typeclass
    + Move `AsRPC` type instances from the `Lorentz.AsRPC` module
      to the modules of their respective types.
  * [!901](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/901)
    Weaken constraints of `getField`
    + `getField` and similar methods now require `Dupable` on the copied field and
      `HasDupableGetters` (defaults to `Dupable`) on the datatype.
  * [!1060](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1060)
    Add `Lorentz.AsRPC` module containing instances for `Morley.AsRPC` type family
  * [!978](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/978)
    Make it difficult to misuse 'Show'
    + Use `Buildable` and `pretty` preferrentially.
    + Avoid using `(+||)` and `(||+)`.
    + Use `Debug.show` when defining `Show` instances.
  * [!1062](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1062)
    Move `senderIsNotAdmin` Lorenz error to `morley-ledgers` repo

    Add synonyms for `SomeConstrainedValue`
    + Reimplement `SomeConstant`, `SomeValue`, `SomeStorage` via `SomeConstrainedValue`.
    + Add `SomePackedVal = SomeConstrainedValue PackedValScope`.
  * [!1049](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1049)
    Delete unnecessary `HasStorage` constraints
    + `Lorentz.Contract` no longer requires `ParameterDeclaresEntrypoints` or `HasAnnotation st`.
    + Added `NiceStorageFull` constraint for when `HasAnnotation st` is actually needed.

  0.13.2
  ======
  * [!1041](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1041)
    `createContract` now returns `TAddress`, not `Address`

  0.13.1
  ======
  * [!1016](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1016)
    + Add support for on-chain views.
    + `Contract`, `TAddress` and similar types has gained a new type argument
      designating the views set exposed by the contract. By default, set it to `()`.
    + The old A1 (aka TZIP-4) views - `View` type and related methods - were renamed
      via adding a `_` suffix: `View_`, `mkView_`, `wrapView_`, e.t.c.
  * [!1010](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1010)
    Add timelock puzzle support.
    + Add Lorentz instruction `openChest`.
    + Add `OpenChest` type, isomorphic to `Either ByteString Bool`
    + Add Lorentz types `ChestT`, `OpenChestT`, abstracting working with any
    type representable as `ByteString` (defined in `Lorentz.Bytes`).
    + Add `openChestT` Lorentz instruction for working with `ChestT` (defined in
    `Lorentz.Bytes`)

  0.13.0
  ======
  * [!915](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/915)
    + Add Fixedpoint arithmetics to lorentz
    + Add additional `NFixed` datatype for natural fixedpoint values
    + Add typeclasses for rounding and casting fixedpoint values
    + Change behavior of lorentz arithmetic operations -
      now type of the result is specified by user.
    + Add `ArithOpHs` instance for `EDiv` instruction
  * [!989](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/989)
    Switch from interpolate to home-grown string interpolation module
    + Note this changes the syntax of slices in `md` quasiquoter. Before
    we could use expressions `#{expression}`, now we can only use variable
    names `#{name}`.
  * [!909](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/909)
    + Update all instances of `Named` functions with patterns from `Morley.Util.Named`
  * [!1000](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/1000)
    Modify the `cloneX` macro to only use `dup`s.
  * [!937](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/937)
    Attach source code location to interpreter error messages
    + Changed morley interpreter error type from `MichelsonFailed` to `MichelsonFailureWithStack`
  * [!945](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/945)
    + Bump Stackage LTS version from 17.9 to 18.10.
  * [!835](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/835)
    + Added `Lorentz.Tickets` module with tickets arithmetics and common helpers.
    + Added `Impossible` error.
    + Added `transferTokensE` and `pairE`.
    + Moved `NonZero` to `Lorentz.Macro`.
    + Updated `Wrappable`:
      + Make separate `Wrappable` and `Unwrappable` typeclasses.
      + Old `Unwrappable` type family renamed to `Unwrappabled`.
      + Weaked permissions to perform some actions for some types.
        May now require `unsafeCoerceWrap` instead of `coerceWrap`.
  * [!922](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/922)
    Replace lSignEd22519 with generic lSign
  * [!881](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/881)
    + Rename `PrintedValScope` to `UntypedValScope` with related types and functions.

  0.12.1
  ======
  * [!879](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/879)
    + Add `Buildable` and `RenderDoc` instances for `(:->)` operator
    + Instances are based on transforming operator to `Instr` type and using its instances

  0.12.0
  ======
  * [!854](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/854)
    + `StoreHasField` instance definition is no more necessary for simple ADT storage types.
  * [!846](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/846)
    + Reorganized `Contract` type and related stuff.
    + Added methods for reading `Contract` from file.

    Migration guide (sufficient unless you worked on framework internals):
    + In case you needed to use non-default contract compilation options, use `mkContractWith` now.

    For more details, see documentation of `Lorentz.Run`.
  * [!832](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/832)
    + Add tickets feature.
    + Add dupable restriction to `dup`-like instructions and some high-level helpers.
      See `dup`'s documentation for notes on how to live in this brand new world.
    + Make `parseNoEnv`, `readValue` and other similar functions accept `MichelsonSource` instead of `FilePath`.
  * [!838](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/838)
    + All unsafe functions and data constructors now contain "unsafe" word
      at prefix position. E.g `UnsafeMText`, `unsafeMkAnnotation`.
  * [!794](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/794)
    [!833](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/833)
    + Added `Lorentz.Expr` module with primitives for convenient expressions evaluation.
      * Added `listE` to construct an expression list from a list of expressions.
    + `if ... then ... else` now is polymorphic in the first argument.
      * Boolean expressions now can appear as condition for `if`.

  0.11.0
  ======
  * [!814](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/814)
    + Added the usage of `Prelude.Type` instead of `Data.Kind.Type`,
      as a result `Kind.Type` was replaced with just `Type`.
  * [!745](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/745)
    + Generalize `st*` methods for working with storage.
      Now it is possible to access nested fields and submaps like `stToField (#a :-| #b)`.
      This should not require any changes unless you keep you own generic helpers over those methods.
    + Existing `StoreHasSubmap (Big?)Map anyName k v` instance is replaced with two:
      * `StoreHasSubmap (Big?)Map Self k v`
      * `StoreHasSubmap store name k v` that delegates to `StoreHasField`.

      Migration guide:
      * If you have `StoreHasSubmap` instances for specific storage and name implemented via
        `storeSubmapOpsDeeper`, remove them and make sure you have a similar `StoreHasField`
        instance implemented via `storeFieldOpsADT`.
      * If you have storage which is directly a map, use `this` instead of label to access the map.
      * If you have an instance for a complex storage which is not represented as simple ADT,
        turn this instance into overlappable one. Make sure that `name` type parameter is of
        concrete type to avoid "overlapping instances" error.
      * The pattern when a datatype transparently provides access to its inner fields via an
        overlapping instance - may not work smoothly and produce "overlapping instances" error.
        To mitigate this do one of the following:
        * Specify the kind of `name` type parameter in your overlapping instance to be concrete
          (i.e. `Symbol`).
        * Use the new functionality to access the nested field by a fully qualified name.

  * [!807](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/807)
    + Add some instances to `BigMap` and `TAddress` types.
  * [!787](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/787)
    + Added new Edo macros: `CAR k` and `CDR k` as `carN` and `cdrN`.
  * [!798](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/798)
    + Added back the `UnaryArithOpHs Abs Integer` instance that was removed by accident.
  * [!802](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/802)
    + Add `NiceParameterFull` and `NiceStorage` constraints to Lorentz `Contract` constructor.
    + Moved `coDisableInitialCast` to `CompilationOptions` datatype.


  0.10.0
  ======
  * [!774](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/774)
    + Added support for `BLS12-381` crypto primitives (types, instructions, arithmetics).
    + Now it is possible to use `int` instruction for newtypes over `Natural`.
  * [!786](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/786)
  * [!791](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/791)
    + Add new Edo instructions: `pairGet` and `pairUpdate`.
  * [!755](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/755)
    Restricted `FAILWITH` only to packable values, except `CONTRACT`s
  * [!759](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/759)
    + Add `UnitErrorArg` and `NoErrorArg` to be used with `ErrorArg` instance.
      + `UnitErrorArg` is preferred to `()`

  ## Overview

  Lorentz is a powerful meta-programming tool which allows one to write Michelson contracts directly in Haskell.

  Haskell's type checker and automatic type inference facilitate contracts implementation and reduce boilerplate related to types.
  Adoption of Algebraic Data Types makes work with complex objects safe and convenient.
  Later Lorentz contract can be dumped as a plain textual Michelson contract using functions from [`Morley.Michelson.Printer`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/morley/docs/Morley-Michelson-Printer.html).

  As an addition, you can optimize the transpiled Michelson contract before printing
  using functions from [`Morley.Michelson.Optimizer`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/morley/docs/Morley-Michelson-Optimizer.html).
  E.g. this optimizer will replace `IF {} {}` with `DROP`. For more possible optimizations
  please refer to the module mentioned earlier.

  You can find Lorentz instructions in [`Lorentz`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lorentz/docs/Lorentz.html) modules.

  Examples of using Lorentz eDSL reside in the [`morley-ledgers`](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley-ledgers)
  or [`tezos-btc`](https://github.com/tz-wrapped/tezos-btc) repos.
  For more information, refer to that README's in the corresponding repositories.

  Also, to get more information about Lorentz you can read our [blogpost](https://serokell.io/blog/lorentz-implementing-smart-contract-edsl-in-haskell).

  ## Writing contracts in Lorentz

  Basically, Lorentz function is just the haskell function that transforms one
  stack to another, this can be presented as the following operator:
  ```haskell
  (inp :: [Type]) :-> (out :: [Type])
  ```

  In order to list types on the stack, we will use `:` operator.
  For example, `Natural : Integer : Bool : '[]`.

  Such design provides a nice code decomposition ability.

  Contract code in Lorentz is Lorentz function with specific type:
  ```haskell
  type ContractOut storage = '[([Operation], storage)]
  type ContractCode parameter storage = '[(parameter, storage)] :-> ContractOut storage
  ```

  Lorentz reimplements all existing [instructions](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lorentz/docs/Lorentz-Instr.html) and
  [macros](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lorentz/docs/Lorentz-Macro.html) from Michelson.

  Apart from reimplementing existing Michelson functionality, Lorentz provides bunch of
  additional features:

  * Pattern-matching on ADTs.
  ```haskell
  data TrafficLight
    = Red
    | Yellow
    | Green
    deriving stock Generic
    deriving anyclass IsoValue

  showTrafficLight :: TrafficLight : s :-> MText : s
  showTrafficLight = caseT
    ( #cRed /-> push [mt|Red|]
    , #cYellow /-> push [mt|Yellow|]
    , #cGreen /-> push [mt|Green|]
    )
  ```
  * `RebindableSyntax` for Lorentz instructions, including `do` notation and `if` operator

  ```haskell
  sumIsGt10 :: Integer : Integer : s :-> Bool : s
  sumIsGt10 = do
    add
    dip $ push @Integer 10
    gt

  foo :: Integer : s :-> Integer : s
  foo = do
    dup
    sumIsGt10
    if Holds
    then do push @Integer 1
    else do push @Integer -1
  ```
  * Records with getters.

  ```haskell
  data UserInfo = UserInfo
    { firstName :: MText
    , secondName :: MText
    , userId :: Natural
    } deriving stock Generic
      deriving anyclass IsoValue

  getFullName :: UserInfo : s :-> MText : s
  getFullName = do
    getField #firstName
    dip $ toField #secondName
    concat
  ```

  * Automatic contracts documentation generation.

    Lorentz provides primitives for embedding documentation in the contract code and
    functions to produce documentation in Markdown, they can be found in
    [`Lorentz.Doc`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lorentz/docs/Lorentz-Doc.html) and [`Morley.Michelson.Doc`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/morley/docs/Morley-Michelson-Doc.html) modules.
    Documentation examples can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/tree/autodoc/master/autodoc).

  ## Sample smart contract written in Lorentz

  Example contract with autodoc and custom data-type tree:
  ```haskell
  data MeasurementMethod
    = ParrotStep
    | MonkeyStep
    | ElephantStep

  $(customGeneric "MeasurementMethod" rightBalanced)

  deriving anyclass instance IsoValue MeasurementMethod
  deriving anyclass instance HasAnnotation MeasurementMethod

  instance TypeHasDoc MeasurementMethod where
    typeDocName _ = "MeasurementMethod"
    typeDocMdDescription =
      "This type defines the way of measuring boa length. \
      \Single boa constrictor corresponds to 38 parrot steps, 31 monkey step \
      \and 9 elephant steps."

  data Parameter
    = MeasureBoaConstrictor ("method" :! MeasurementMethod)
    | Zero ()
    deriving stock Generic
    deriving anyclass IsoValue

  instance ParameterHasEntrypoints Parameter where
    type ParameterEntrypointsDerivation Parameter = EpdPlain

  type Storage = Natural

  measureBoaConstrictor :: ContractCode Parameter Storage
  measureBoaConstrictor = docGroup (DName "Boa constrictor measurement") $ do
    doc $ DDescription "This contract measures boa constrictor."
    unpair
    dip drop
    entryCase @Parameter (Proxy @PlainEntrypointsKind)
      ( #cMeasureBoaConstrictor /-> do
          doc $ DDescription "Measure the boa constrictor with given method."
          fromNamed #method
          caseT @MeasurementMethod
            ( #cParrotStep /-> push @Natural 38
            , #cMonkeyStep /-> push @Natural 31
            , #cElephantStep /-> push @Natural 9
            )
      , #cZero /-> do
          doc $ DDescription "Put zero to the storage."
          drop; push @Natural 0
      )
    nil; pair
  ```

  ## FAQ

  <!-- This question should be removed once https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/issues/79 is resolved -->
  * Q: I added a new parameter case to contract and GHC went mad.

    A: Ensure that your number of entry points does not exceed the limit set in [`Morley.Util.TypeTuple.Instances`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/morley/docs/Morley-Util-TypeTuple-Instances.html).

  * Q: I added one more datatype that is used in the contract and GHC reports with errors related
       to `Rep` type family.

    A: Make sure your datatype derives `Generic` instance and all primitive types used in it have `IsPrimitiveValue`
       set to `True`.
