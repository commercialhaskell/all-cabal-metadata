  ==========
  <!-- Append new entries here -->

  0.11.0
  ======
  * [!814](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/814)
    + Added the usage of `Prelude.Type` instead of `Data.Kind.Type`,
      as a result `Kind.Type` was replaced with just `Type`.
  * [!745](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/745)
    + Generalize `st*` methods for working with storage.
      Now it is possible to access nested fields and submaps like `stToField (#a :-| #b)`.
      This should not require any changes unless you keep you own generic helpers over those methods.
    + Existing `StoreHasSubmap (Big?)Map anyName k v` instance is replaced with two:
      * `StoreHasSubmap (Big?)Map Self k v`
      * `StoreHasSubmap store name k v` that delegates to `StoreHasField`.

      Migration guide:
      * If you have `StoreHasSubmap` instances for specific storage and name implemented via
        `storeSubmapOpsDeeper`, remove them and make sure you have a similar `StoreHasField`
        instance implemented via `storeFieldOpsADT`.
      * If you have storage which is directly a map, use `this` instead of label to access the map.
      * If you have an instance for a complex storage which is not represented as simple ADT,
        turn this instance into overlappable one.
  * [!807](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/807)
    + Add some instances to `BigMap` and `TAddress` types.
  * [!787](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/787)
    + Added new Edo macros: `CAR k` and `CDR k` as `carN` and `cdrN`.
  * [!798](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/798)
    + Added back the `UnaryArithOpHs Abs Integer` instance that was removed by accident.

  0.10.0
  ======
  * [!774](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/774)
    + Added support for `BLS12-381` crypto primitives (types, instructions, arithmetics).
    + Now it is possible to use `int` instruction for newtypes over `Natural`.
  * [!786](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/786)
  * [!791](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/791)
    + Add new Edo instructions: `pairGet` and `pairUpdate`.
  * [!755](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/755)
    Restricted `FAILWITH` only to packable values, except `CONTRACT`s
  * [!759](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/759)
    + Add `UnitErrorArg` and `NoErrorArg` to be used with `ErrorArg` instance.
      + `UnitErrorArg` is preferred to `()`
      + `NoErrorArg` allows failing with just a string instead of a `pair string unit`.
  * [!764](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/764)
    + Added `Never` type, deprecated `Empty` type.

  0.9.1
  =====
  * [!781](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/781)
    + Replaced mixins and dependency on `base` with `base-noprelude`.
  * [!751](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/751)
    + Add new Edo instruction: `LEVEL`.
  * [!741](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/741)
    + Add new Edo instructions: `SHA3` and `KECCAK`.

  0.9.0
  =====
  * [!731](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/731)
    Added `GenericStrategy`-ies for compatibility with LIGO.
  * [!712](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/712)
    Add lenses for Lorentz contract config.
  * [!684](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/684)
    + Simplify working with autodoc in contracts (breaking change).
    + `finalizeParamCallingDoc` is now applied automatically when lorentz' `Contract`
      is used, no need to call it manually.

  0.8.0
  =====
  * [!671](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/671)
    + Add `TypeHasDoc` instances for `TAddress` and `FutureContract`.
    + Add a generic `instance DocItem (DEntrypoint ep)`.
      In case of getting overlapping instances, you have to implement `EntrypointKindHasDoc` instead.
    + Some error messages in doc tests are improved.
    + Some bugfixes for anchors.
    + Cases with contract logic residing outside of entrypoints are now better handled.
  * [!665](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/665)
    Improve `StorageContains` to work for polymorphic case (when field is marked with `Identity`).
  * [!679](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/679)
    Add `dupLNamed`.
  * [!672](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/672)
    + Add `Packed`, `TSignature` and `Hash` types.
    + `pack` and `unpack` now work with `Packed` instead of `ByteString` (for the sake of better type-safety).
      Either use `Packed` type, or `packRaw`/`unpackRaw` instructions.
    + `checkSignature` now works with `Packed` and `TSignature`.
    + `blake2b` and other hashing instructions now work with `Hash`.
    + If necessary, coersions can be used to switch between the mentioned types and raw `ByteString`.
  * [!667](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/667)
    + Modify representation of extended lambdas
      (arbitrary code used as lambdas is now packed into right-hand combs, not left-hand ones).
    + Add `applicate` macro.
  * [!630](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/630)
    Use `:` in all library instructions instead of `&`.
  * [!652](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/652)
    Update the `ContractRegistry` to be able to not require contract name for
    all its commands when there is only one contract.
  * [!640](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/640)
    Change `StoreSubmapOps` to contain no optional methods.

  0.7.1
  =====
  * [!653](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/653)
    Added primitives for evaluating `OpSize` in Lorentz.
  * [!651](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/651)
    Add `dupL`.

  0.7.0
  =====
  * [!629](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/629)
    All `UStore` modules has been moved to the [morley-upgradeable](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley-upgradeable/) repository.
    Now you have to include that repository to your build and import `Lorentz.UStore`.
  * [!610](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/610)
    Remove `Lorentz.TestScenario`.
  * [!585](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/585)

  0.6.2
  =====
  * [!589](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/589)
    Add `annOptions` method in `HasAnnotation` which can be used to customize
    the generated annotations of a type.
    + Add helper functions to use with `annOptions`.
  * [!591](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/591)
    Add `dupTop2`.

  0.6.1
  =====
  * [!533](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/533)
    Add `entrypointDoc`, `typeDoc`, and `errorDoc` quasiquotes which help
    generating typeclass instances.

  0.6.0
  =====
  * [!558](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/558)
    Added a new `wrapOne` to wrap a value in a constructor with a single field,
    because it has the advantage of having an input stack that does not depend on
    a type family.
  * [!528](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/528)
    The generated documentation now contains a sample value of each entrypoint.
    + Allow modification of sample value via `mkDEntrypointExample`.
  * [!493](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/493)
    Add support for root entrypoint.
    + A contract can now specify whether or not the root annotation should be generated
      and which name it should use.
    + `self` and `contract` instructions are able to call the root entrypoint.

  0.5.0
  =====
  * [!530](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/530)
    Field annotation are now generated for sum-type in `parameter` and `storage`.
    + It also ensures that it will not generate field annotations that would introduce
    extra entrypoints.

    Make `view_` argument accept 2 arguments rather than a pair.
  * [!486](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/486)
    Add `customGeneric` to derive `Generic` instances with a custom tree structure
    and, consequently, `IsoValue` instances with such a structure.
  * [!483](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/483)
    Add a way to generate field annotations for entrypoint parameter.
  * [!470](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/470)
    Move `Lorentz.Test` and  Hedgehog generators to a new package: `cleveland`.
  * [!357](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/357)
    Remove deprecated `Lorentz.Store` module and deprecated custom error functionality.

  0.4.0
  =====
  * [!449](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/449)
    + Improve `Lorentz.Test.Integrational` interface.
    + Remove `IntegrationalValidator`, `SuccessValidator`, `validate`,
      `composeValidators`, `composeValidatorsList`, `expectAnySuccess`.
    + Add `unexpectedInterpreterError`, `attempt`, `catchExpectedError`.
    + Change type of `expect*`/`tExpect*`/`lExpect*` functions.
      They now return `IntegrationalScenario` instead of `SuccessValidator` / `Bool`.
    + Rename `ValidationError` to `TestError`
    + Replace `TestError`'s `UnexpectedExecutorError` constructor with
      `InterpreterError` and `UnexpectedInterpreterError`.
  * [!432](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/432)
    Add `whenNone` to Lorentz.
  * [!398](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/398)
    Add `StoreHasEntrypoint` class to conveniently use entrypoints as lambdas
    stored into `big_map`(s) to make use of lazy evaluation.
  * [!409](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/409)
    + Add hedgehog support
  * [!303](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/303)
    + Functions for working with `UStore` from Haskell world (e.g. `fillUStore`) now have a different constraint.
    + `UStore` templates are now documented and thus may require instance of the respective typeclass.

  0.3.0
  =====
  * [!417](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/417)
  Change the license to MIT.
  * [!360](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/360)
    + Add `compileLorentzWithOptions` function that accepts optional Michelson
    optimizer configuration and string transformer function. Changed `compileLorentz` to call the
    optimizer with the default configuration.
    + Add `Lorentz.Contract` data type as a wrapper for `Lorentz.ContractCode` and
      `Lorentz.CompilationOptions`. Require that all contracts are wrapped in this data type.
  * [!354](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/354)
    + Add `constructStack` function that constructs a datatype from fields on the stack.
    + Add `deconstruct` function that deconstructs a datatype to its fields on the stack.
  * [!358](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/358)
    Removed deprecated `STEPS_TO_QUOTA` instruction.
  * [!337](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/337)
    Added `comment`, `commentAroundFun` and `commentAroundStmt` to generate comments in Michelson code.

  0.2.0
  =====
  * [!346](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/346)
    Added `docStorage` and `contractGeneralDefault`.
  * [!306](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/306)
    Deprecated `mapMigrationCode` in favor of `MapLorentzInstr`.
  * [!326](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/326)
  Updated contract registry (`Lorentz.ContractRegistry`):
    + Now it can print initial storage apart from contract and documentation.
    + Some extra fields were added to `ContractInfo`.
    + Logic is captured in the `runContractRegistry` function.
    + If you don't specify output file, we will use a file with name constructed from contract name. Pass `-` if you want `stdout`.
  * [!245](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/245) Added `HasTypeAnn` instance for `FutureContract arg`.
  * [!294](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/294)
    + Added `Paths_*` modules to `autogen-modules` in cabal files.  Removed `-O0`
    + from default GHC options. Please set `ghc-options` in your `stack.yaml` or
    `cabal.project.local`.
  * [!271](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/merge_requests/271) Renamed
    'Contract' to 'ContractCode', and appended "Code" to the names of two functions:
    'convertContract' and 'printTypedContract'
  * [!267](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/merge_requests/267)
    + Retain type annotations in entrypoints derivation.
    + Remove overlappable `HasTypeAnn` instance defined for nearly each type.
      Add `default` `getTypeAnn` method definition instead and manually define `HasTypeAnn` instance for each type instead (trivially).
      When you create a new data type with `IsoValue` instance, you usually have to derive `HasTypeAnn` as well.

  ## Overview

  Lorentz is a powerful meta-programming tool which allows one to write Michelson contracts directly in Haskell.

  Haskell's type checker and automatic type inference facilitate contracts implementation and reduce boilerplate related to types.
  Adoption of Algebraic Data Types makes work with complex objects safe and convenient.
  Later Lorentz contract can be dumped as a plain textual Michelson contract using functions from [`Michelson.Printer`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/morley/docs/Michelson-Printer.html).

  As an addition, you can optimize the transpiled Michelson contract before printing
  using functions from [`Michelson.Optimizer`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/morley/docs/Michelson-Optimizer.html).
  E.g. this optimizer will replace `IF {} {}` with `DROP`. For more possible optimizations
  please refer to the module mentioned earlier.

  You can find Lorentz instructions in [`Lorentz`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lorentz/docs/Lorentz.html) modules.

  Examples of using Lorentz eDSL reside in the [`morley-ledgers`](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley-ledgers)
  or [`tezos-btc`](https://github.com/tz-wrapped/tezos-btc) repos.
  For more information, refer to that README's in the corresponding repositories.

  Also, to get more information about Lorentz you can read our [blogpost](https://serokell.io/blog/lorentz-implementing-smart-contract-edsl-in-haskell).

  ## Writing contracts in Lorentz

  Basically, Lorentz function is just the haskell function that transforms one
  stack to another, this can be presented as the following operator:
  ```haskell
  (inp :: [Type]) :-> (out :: [Type])
  ```

  In order to list types on the stack, we will use `:` operator.
  For example, `Natural : Integer : Bool : '[]`.

  Such design provides a nice code decomposition ability.

  Contract code in Lorentz is Lorentz function with specific type:
  ```haskell
  type ContractOut storage = '[([Operation], storage)]
  type ContractCode parameter storage = '[(parameter, storage)] :-> ContractOut storage
  ```

  Lorentz reimplements all existing [instructions](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lorentz/docs/Lorentz-Instr.html) and
  [macros](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lorentz/docs/Lorentz-Macro.html) from Michelson.

  Apart from reimplementing existing Michelson functionality, Lorentz provides bunch of
  additional features:

  * Pattern-matching on ADTs.
  ```haskell
  data TrafficLight
    = Red
    | Yellow
    | Green
    deriving stock Generic
    deriving anyclass IsoValue

  showTrafficLight :: TrafficLight : s :-> MText : s
  showTrafficLight = caseT
    ( #cRed /-> push [mt|Red|]
    , #cYellow /-> push [mt|Yellow|]
    , #cGreen /-> push [mt|Green|]
    )
  ```
  * `RebindableSyntax` for Lorentz instructions, including `do` notation and `if` operator

  ```haskell
  sumIsGt10 :: Integer : Integer : s :-> Bool : s
  sumIsGt10 = do
    add
    dip $ push @Integer 10
    gt

  foo :: Integer : s :-> Integer : s
  foo = do
    dup
    sumIsGt10
    if Holds
    then do push @Integer 1
    else do push @Integer -1
  ```
  * Records with getters.

  ```haskell
  data UserInfo = UserInfo
    { firstName :: MText
    , secondName :: MText
    , userId :: Natural
    } deriving stock Generic
      deriving anyclass IsoValue

  getFullName :: UserInfo : s :-> MText : s
  getFullName = do
    getField #firstName
    dip $ toField #secondName
    concat
  ```

  * Automatic contracts documentation generation.

    Lorentz provides primitives for embedding documentation in the contract code and
    functions to produce documentation in Markdown, they can be found in
    [`Lorentz.Doc`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lorentz/docs/Lorentz-Doc.html) and [`Michelson.Doc`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/morley/docs/Michelson-Doc.html) modules.
    Documentation examples can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/tree/autodoc/master/autodoc).

  ## Sample smart contract written in Lorentz

  Example contract with autodoc and custom data-type tree:
  ```haskell
  data MeasurementMethod
    = ParrotStep
    | MonkeyStep
    | ElephantStep

  $(customGeneric "MeasurementMethod" rightBalanced)

  deriving anyclass instance IsoValue MeasurementMethod
  deriving anyclass instance HasAnnotation MeasurementMethod

  instance TypeHasDoc MeasurementMethod where
    typeDocName _ = "MeasurementMethod"
    typeDocMdDescription =
      "This type defines the way of measuring boa length. \
      \Single boa constrictor corresponds to 38 parrot steps, 31 monkey step \
      \and 9 elephant steps."

  data Parameter
    = MeasureBoaConstrictor ("method" :! MeasurementMethod)
    | Zero ()
    deriving stock Generic
    deriving anyclass IsoValue

  instance ParameterHasEntrypoints Parameter where
    type ParameterEntrypointsDerivation Parameter = EpdPlain

  type Storage = Natural

  measureBoaConstrictor :: ContractCode Parameter Storage
  measureBoaConstrictor = docGroup (DName "Boa constrictor measurement") $ do
    doc $ DDescription "This contract measures boa constrictor."
    unpair
    dip drop
    entryCase @Parameter (Proxy @PlainEntrypointsKind)
      ( #cMeasureBoaConstrictor /-> do
          doc $ DDescription "Measure the boa constrictor with given method."
          fromNamed #method
          caseT @MeasurementMethod
            ( #cParrotStep /-> push @Natural 38
            , #cMonkeyStep /-> push @Natural 31
            , #cElephantStep /-> push @Natural 9
            )
      , #cZero /-> do
          doc $ DDescription "Put zero to the storage."
          drop; push @Natural 0
      )
    nil; pair
  ```

  ### Generated documentation

  Generated documentation for this contract can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/blob/master/code/lorentz/doc/sampleAutodoc.md).

  ### Transpiled Michelson contract

                                                   (or unit
                                                       unit))

                 { DROP;
                   PUSH nat 0 };
         NIL operation;
         PAIR };
  ```

  ## FAQ

  <!-- This question should be removed once https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/issues/79 is resolved -->
  * Q: I added a new parameter case to contract and GHC went mad.

    A: Ensure that your number of entry points does not exceed the limit set in [`Util.TypeTuple.Instances`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/morley/docs/Util-TypeTuple-Instances.html).

  * Q: I added one more datatype that is used in the contract and GHC reports with errors related
       to `Rep` type family.

    A: Make sure your datatype derives `Generic` instance and all primitive types used in it have `IsPrimitiveValue`
       set to `True`.
