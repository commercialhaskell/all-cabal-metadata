changelog: |
  0.13.2 [2021.11.15]
  -------------------
  * Add an `Eq1 Log` instance.
  * Allow building with `hashable-1.4.*`.

  0.13.1 [2021.02.17]
  -------------------
  * The build-type has been changed from `Custom` to `Simple`.
    To achieve this, the `doctests` test suite has been removed in favor of using
    [`cabal-docspec`](https://github.com/phadej/cabal-extras/tree/master/cabal-docspec)
    to run the doctests.

  0.13 [2019.11.21]
  -----------------
  * Replace dependency on `Precise` with standard functions available from `base` 4.9 onward.

  0.12 [2018.01.18]
  -----------------
  * Add `Semigroup` instance for `Log`.
  * Drop `safecopy` support
  * Removed some unused constraints.

  0.11.2
  ------
  * Support `doctest-0.12`

  0.11.1
  ------
  * Revamp `Setup.hs` to use `cabal-doctest`. This makes it build
    with `Cabal-2.0`, and makes the `doctest`s work with `cabal new-build` and
    sandboxes.

  0.11
  ----
  * Replace use of `Hashable1` from `hashable-extras` in favor of `Hashable` from
    `hashable-1.2.5.0`. As a result, the `hashable-extras` dependency has been removed.
  * On Windows, we now use the FFI to link against the C math library if building with
    GHC 8.0 or later, which features a much improved runtime linker story.
  * Remove `generic-deriving` dependency

  0.10.3.1
  --------
  * Support `safecopy` 0.9

  0.10.3
  ------
  * Work around an issue with `safecopy` on GHC 7.10
  * Changed the repository link to my `ekmett` github account from `analytics`.

  0.10.2.1
  --------
  * Add `vector` 0.11 support.

  0.10.2
  ------
  * Add `generic-deriving` 1.8 support. We also no longer incur a `generic-deriving` dependency at all on GHC 7.6+

  0.10.1.1
  --------
  * Compiles warning-free on GHC 7.10

  0.10.1
  ------
  * `semigroupoids` 5 support.

  0.10.0.1
  --------
  * Improved the stability and portability of the `doctest` test suite

  0.10
  ----
  * `(**)` is now much more accurately defined.
  * We now avoid comparisons for equality with infinities.
  * Fixed a bug in `negate`.
  * On windows we avoid FFI into the math library, and accept less accurate results. (Sorry!)

  0.9.3
  -------
  * Fixed subtraction again. For real this time.

  0.9.2.1
  -------
  * Support `generic-deriving` 1.7

  0.9.2
  -----
  * Fixed subtraction better.

  0.9.1
  -----
  * Fixed subtraction.

  0.8
  ---
  * Updated to `comonad` and `semigroupoids` 4.

  0.7.2
  -----
  * Dependency bump to allow `comonad` and `semigroupoids` 4.0

  0.7.1
  -----
  * Marked `Numeric.Log` `Trustworthy`.

  0.6
  ---
  * Renamed the data constructor to `Exp` and the field accessor to `ln` per issue #1.

  0.5.0.1
  -------
  * Wider bounds for `generic-deriving` so we can build with GHC HEAD.

  0.5
  ---
  * Switched the `Hashable1` instance to use the new, lighter, `hashable-extras`

  0.4
  ---
  * `instance Hashable1 Log`

  0.3.0.1
  -------
  * Wider `binary` version bound

  0.3
  ---
  * Added support for `cereal`.

  0.2
  ---
  * Added an `Enum` instance.
  * Added `sum` to calculate using the `log-sum-exp` trick.

  0.1.0.1
  -------
  * Minor packaging changes

  0.1
  ---
  * Renamed from `log` to `log-domain` due to internal hackage issues rendering that name inaccessible.
  * Ported `Numeric.Log` from [analytics](http://github.com/analytics) at the request of @bgamari
