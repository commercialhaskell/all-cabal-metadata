  log2json
  --------

  The log2json command takes the LogFormat string to use and a list of
  filenames as command-line arguments. If nothing is supplied, it goes
  into "demo" mode, prompting you for a LogFormat and a single log
  record to parse.

      log2json '%b' a.log b.log

  LogFormat
  ---------

  LogFormat is a Haskell module that makes it trivial to parse access
  log records.

  LogFormat will take the [LogFormat configuration][mod_log_config] from
  your httpd.conf file and a log file and give you your log records as
  Maps where the key is the field name.

  The Apache httpd configuration files allow you to customize the format
  of your log file records using the LogFormat directive. For example,
  if you want every line of your access log to read "Hello Web" you can
  do that like so:

      LogFormat "Hello Web" custom

  More often you'll use a value such as

      LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b" common

  and receive log records like

      127.0.0.1 - frank [10/Oct/2000:13:55:36 -0700] "GET /apache_pb.gif HTTP/1.0" 200 2326
