description: ! "* Load Font\n  This library aims to a cross-platform (Win/Lin/OSX)
  GUI agnostic way to load a custom font bundled with your Haskell app and is [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/load-font/docs/Graphics-UI-Font-Load.html][extensively]]
  documented on Hackage.\n\n* Load Font Demo\n\n  Included is a demo that shows off
  the library, but it is optional and does not build unless you set the ~demo~ flag
  as in the build instructions below.\n\n  It builds an executable ~load-font-exe~
  which uses the [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fltkhs][FLTKHS]] GUI framework
  and bundles the [[https://www.dafont.com/moon-phases.font][Moon Phases]] font. It
  has been tested on Arch Linux, Windows 10 and OSX Sierra.\n\n  The demo uses FLTKHS
  font loading and unloading but it is agnostic to the GUI framework. FLTKHS is used
  here simply because it's the easiest to build and install.\n\n  This library owes
  its existence to [[https://groups.google.com/d/msg/fltkgeneral/uAdg8wOLiMk/_CzBu995AwAJ][Albrecht
  Schlosser's post on the FLTK mailing list]].\n\n  To run the demo, clone this repo
  and do:\n  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE\n  > stack build --flag load-font:demo --flag fltkhs:bundled\n
  \ > stack exec load-font-exe\n  #+END_EXAMPLE\n\n [[file:screenshot-demo.jpg]]\n"
