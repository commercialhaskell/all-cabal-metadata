  * Load Font
    This library aims to a cross-platform (Win/Lin/OSX) GUI agnostic way to load a custom font bundled with your Haskell app and is [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/load-font/docs/Graphics-UI-Font-Load.html][extensively]] documented on Hackage.

  * Load Font Demo

    Included is a demo that shows off the library, but it is optional and does not build unless you set the ~demo~ flag as in the build instructions below.

    It builds an executable ~load-font-exe~ which uses the [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fltkhs][FLTKHS]] GUI framework and bundles the [[https://www.dafont.com/moon-phases.font][Moon Phases]] font. It has been tested on Arch Linux, Windows 10 and OSX Sierra.

    The demo uses FLTKHS font loading and unloading but it is agnostic to the GUI framework. FLTKHS is used here simply because it's the easiest to build and install.

    This library owes its existence to [[https://groups.google.com/d/msg/fltkgeneral/uAdg8wOLiMk/_CzBu995AwAJ][Albrecht Schlosser's post on the FLTK mailing list]].

    To run the demo, clone this repo and do:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > stack build --flag load-font:demo --flag fltkhs:bundled
    > stack exec load-font-exe
    #+END_EXAMPLE
