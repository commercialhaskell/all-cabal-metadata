changelog: ! "# 1.2.6\n\n## Other Changes\n\n* Increased upper bound of `base` and
  support GHC 8.4.\n\n---\n\n# 1.2.5\n\n## Other Changes\n\n* Increased upper bound
  of `exceptions`.\n\n---\n\n# 1.2.4\n\n## Other Changes\n\n* Increased upper bound
  of `exceptions`.\n\n---\n\n# 1.2.3\n\n## Other Changes\n\n* Increased upper of `async`.\n\n---\n\n#
  1.2.2\n\n## Other Changes\n\n* Increased upper bound of `free` and `time`.\n\n---\n\n#
  1.2.1\n\n## Other Changes\n\n* Increased upper bound of `base` to allow < 4.11.\n\n---\n\n#
  1.2.0\n\n## Major Changes\n\n- `withFDHandler` now explicitly flushes the file handle
  whenever log entries\n   are rendered out. Thanks to @filterfish for identifying
  this omission that\n   could lead to log messages being dropped.\n\n   Upgrade steps:
  no changes other than updating `logging-effect`.\n\n---\n\n# 1.1.3\n\n## Other Changes\n\n-
  Increased upper bound of `time` to allow < 1.9.\n\n---\n\n# 1.1.2\n\n## Other changes\n\n-
  Increased upper bound of `time`\n\n---\n\n# 1.1.1\n\n- `withBatchedHandler` no longer
  prints empty log messages. Previously,\n  if you ran a program that didn't log but
  used `withBatchedHandler` (or anything\n  that used that), an empty log message
  would be output. Thanks to @codedmart\n  for fixing this.\n\n---\n\n# 1.1.0\n\n*Breaking
  changes*:\n\n- `MonadLog` no longer has `logMessage` as a function. It now has\n
  \ `logMessageFree` which takes a free monoid of log messages. If you were just\n
  \ using `logging-effect` then this won't affect you, as `logMessage` still exists\n
  \ with the same signature outside the type class.\n\n- `MonadLog` now comes with
  a law that states that logging is a monoid\n  homomorphism. This essentially means
  that you have to treat all log messages\n  uniformly.\n\n- Pass-through instances
  for all \"stock\" monad transformers have been added\n  (all of `transformers`,
  `CatchT` from exceptions and `FreeT`/`FT` from `free`).\n\n- `WithSeverity` now
  has instances of `Traversable` and `Foldable`\n\n- `WithTimestamp` now has instances
  of `Eq`, `Ord`, `Read` and `Show`.\n\n*Additions*:\n\n- A set of convenience functions
  have been added for quickly logging with\n  severity. The combinators are: `logDebug`,
  `logInfo`, `logNotice`,\n  `logWarning`, `logError`, `logCritical`, `logAlert` and
  `logEmergency`.\n\n- `mapLogMessage` got a companion function `mapLogMessageM` that
  works with\n  monadic tranformations.\n\n*Other*\n\n- Many documentation bug fixes.\n\n-
  INLINEABLE pragmas added.\n\n---\n\n# 1.0.0\n\n- Initial release\n"
