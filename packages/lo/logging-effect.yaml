synopsis: A mtl-style monad transformer for general purpose & compositional logging
changelog: ! "# 1.1.3\n\n## Other Changes\n\n- Increased upper bound of `time` to
  allow < 1.9.\n\n---\n\n# 1.1.2\n\n## Other changes\n\n- Increased upper bound of
  `time`\n\n---\n\n# 1.1.1\n\n- `withBatchedHandler` no longer prints empty log messages.
  Previously,\n  if you ran a program that didn't log but used `withBatchedHandler`
  (or anything\n  that used that), an empty log message would be output. Thanks to
  @codedmart\n  for fixing this.\n\n---\n\n# 1.1.0\n\n*Breaking changes*:\n\n- `MonadLog`
  no longer has `logMessage` as a function. It now has\n  `logMessageFree` which takes
  a free monoid of log messages. If you were just\n  using `logging-effect` then this
  won't affect you, as `logMessage` still exists\n  with the same signature outside
  the type class.\n\n- `MonadLog` now comes with a law that states that logging is
  a monoid\n  homomorphism. This essentially means that you have to treat all log
  messages\n  uniformly.\n\n- Pass-through instances for all \"stock\" monad transformers
  have been added\n  (all of `transformers`, `CatchT` from exceptions and `FreeT`/`FT`
  from `free`).\n\n- `WithSeverity` now has instances of `Traversable` and `Foldable`\n\n-
  `WithTimestamp` now has instances of `Eq`, `Ord`, `Read` and `Show`.\n\n*Additions*:\n\n-
  A set of convenience functions have been added for quickly logging with\n  severity.
  The combinators are: `logDebug`, `logInfo`, `logNotice`,\n  `logWarning`, `logError`,
  `logCritical`, `logAlert` and `logEmergency`.\n\n- `mapLogMessage` got a companion
  function `mapLogMessageM` that works with \n  monadic tranformations.\n\n*Other*\n\n-
  Many documentation bug fixes.\n\n- INLINEABLE pragmas added.\n\n---\n\n# 1.0.0\n\n-
  Initial release\n"
