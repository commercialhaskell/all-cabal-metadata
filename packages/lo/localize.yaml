  ===============

  This package is more or less fully functional translation framework,
  based on [haskell-gettext][1] package. The key features are:

  * Convinient functions for translation.
  * Full support of gettext features, such as message contexts and plural forms.
  * It is possible to detect language to use by process locale. But it is not
    necessary, you for example may want to use `Accept-Language` HTTP header
    instead.
  * Easy integration with custom monadic stacks by implementing instance of
    `Localized` type class.
  * There are two simple implementations of `Localized` type class, for IO and
    StateT-based monad transformer. Being mostly examples, these implementations
    can be useful in relatively simple applications.
  * Utility functions to locate catalog files by specified rules. Example rules
    for locating catalog files under source directory and for locating them
    under usual Linux locations are provided.
  * Integration with [text-format-heavy][2] package. It may be more convinient
    than use of some other formatting libraries (`printf`, for example),
    since it supports named variable placeholders, much easier for translators
    to understand.

  Please refer to Haddock documentation and to examples in `examples/` directory.
