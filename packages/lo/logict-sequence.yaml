  # Revision history for logict-sequence
  ## 0.2.0.1 -- 2022-11-23

  * Fix a serious laziness bug in `<|>` and `>>=`. These were stricter than they
    should be in some cases.

  ## 0.2     -- 2022-11-22

  * Rename things having to do with views, to enforce a consistent
    naming convention.

  * Drop support for GHC versions before 7.8.

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2021-07-19

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  # LogicT-Sequence

  Provides a variant of the `LogicT` monad that should have
  asymptotically better performance when frequently observing
  results. This is based on the the [Reflection without Remorse
  paper.](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/zseq.pdf) I created this package
  mainly because the code from the paper was not easy to use as a
  library.

  Please see the [LogicT paper](http://okmij.org/ftp/papers/LogicT.pdf)
  for examples on how to use this monad.
