  # LogicT-Sequence

  Provides a variant of the `LogicT` monad that should have
  asymptotically better performance when frequently observing
  results. This is based on the the [Reflection without Remorse
  paper.](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/zseq.pdf) I created this package
  mainly because the code from the paper was not easy to use as a
  library.

  Please see the [LogicT paper](http://okmij.org/ftp/papers/LogicT.pdf)
  for examples on how to use this monad.
