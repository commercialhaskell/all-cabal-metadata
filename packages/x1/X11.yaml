    * Added `xrrGetMonitors` and `XRRMonitorInfo` (#42)

    * Added `setClassHint` (#76)

    * Added a few missing event mask fields to `WindowAttributes` (#77)

  ## 1.9.2 (2020-08-25)

      through to Cabal. The fix was contributed by Greg Steuck (#53, #69).

    * Locate the include statement for `HsAllKeysyms.h` above the relevant ifdefs
      to avoid issues during cross compilation. The fix was contributed by

  # Haskell binding to the X11 graphics library [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/X11.svg?style=flat)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/X11) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/xmonad/X11.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/xmonad/X11)

  To build this package using Cabal directly from Git, you must run
  `autoreconf` before the usual Cabal build steps (configure/build/install).
  `autoreconf` is included in the GNU autoconf tools.  There is no need to run
  the `configure` script: the `cabal configure` step will do this for you.

  If you are building from a source tarball, you can just use the standard Cabal
  installation stanza:

      cabal configure
      cabal build
      cabal install

  Xinerama support is enabled by default if Xinerama headers are detected.  To
  disable Xinerama support, add the `--without-xinerama` flag to
  `configure-option`:

      cabal configure --configure-option="--without-xinerama"

  However, if you are building from Git, X11 uses `autoconf`, so you need
  to have `autoconf` installed and run `autoconf`/`autoheader` before building:

      autoconf
      autoheader

  or

      autoreconf

  You will need development versions of at least the X11, xrandr, and XScreenSaver
  libraries installed for the build to succeed; having the development version of
  the Xinerama library will enable some optional bindings.
