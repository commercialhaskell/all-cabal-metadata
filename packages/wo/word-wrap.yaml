synopsis: A library for word-wrapping
changelog: |2

  0.5
  ===

  API changes:
   * Line-wrapping now supports optional "filling", i.e., placing prefix
     strings at the start of wrapped lines. The behavior of filling is
     configured by new `WrapSettings` fields: `fillStrategy` (what to
     add to filled lines) and `fillScope` (which lines to affect with
     filling). Thanks to Brent Yorgey for this work!

  0.4.1
  =====

  Bug fixes:
   * Fixed a bug that caused breakTokens to diverge for lines with
     indentation longer than the indentation width when
     preserveIndentation was enabled. (Thanks Callum Oakley.) The
     resulting fix does the following:
     * When breakLongWords is enabled, this change reduces the indentation
       of the indented lines to result in lines that are no longer than
       the wrap limit, so they will have reduced indentation and word
       fragments. This is a trade-off with other options that are open to
       evaluation.
     * When breakLongWords is disabled, this change reduces the
       indentation of the indented lines and leaves whole words, unbroken,
       on them, resulting in lines that are longer than the indentation
       limit. This behavior is similar to non-indented lines with
       over-long tokens. This is also a trade-off with other options that
       are open to evaluation.

  0.4
  ===

  Bug fixes:
   * Fixed a bug where each line was being wrapped after every word
     because only one case in breakTokens was reached (thanks Callum
     Oakley)

  Package changes:
   * Added a simple benchmark suite

  0.3.3
  =====

  Bug fixes:
   * Fixed accidental breaking of long tokens when they could be wrapped
     instead.

  0.3.2
  =====

  Bug fixes:
   * Fixed a bug that prevented wrapping sometimes.

  0.3.1
  =====

  Bug fixes:
   * Fix inconsistent long token breaking (long tokens anywhere but the
     beginning of a line)

  0.3
  ===

  API changes:
   * Added the breakLongWords setting to WrapSettings. This setting makes
     it possible to cause words to get broken up over multiple lines if
     their lengths exceed the wrapping width.

  0.2
  ===

  API changes:
   * Added a WrapSettings data type for controlling wrapping behavior.
   * All functions now require a WrapSettings.
   * Added defaultWrapSettings for prior behavior.
   * Wrap settings now include a setting to control how indentation is
     preserved in broken lines.

  Bug fixes:
   * Lines with only whitespace are preserved as empty lines.

  0.1.2
  =====

  Bug fixes:
   * Fixed a bug where multiple consecutive newlines were not properly preserved
     as advertised (#2)

  0.1.1
  =====

  Package changes:
   * Removed a duplicate mention of the changelog file in the cabal
     package description that used the wrong filename case (#1)

  0.1
  ===

  * First version.
