changelog: "# Changelog for turtle-haskell\r\n\r\n## v0.2.2\r\n\r\n* Upgrading to
  GHC 8.10.3 to resolve problems GHC compiler problems with Mac \r\nOSX. See [here](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/18446)
  for details.\r\n* Fixed issue where newly drawn lines were drawn under older lines.\r\n\r\n##
  v0.2.1\r\n\r\n* Internally simplified the commands system to use a Maybe Monad for
  sequencing.\r\n\r\n## v0.2.0\r\n\r\n* Split `TurtleCommand` into `TurtleCommand`
  and `WorldCommand` to help reduce\r\n  boilerplate of having to apply a turtle to
  a command for every stage of a\r\n  command block.\r\n* Added `runWorld`, `runTurtle`,
  `run`, and `(>/>)` functions.\r\n* `circle` command split into `arc` and `circle`
  commands.\r\n* Fixed `shiftHue` as function did not match documentation.\r\n\r\n##
  v0.1.2\r\n\r\n* Added the `branch` function.\r\n\r\n## v0.1.1\r\n\r\n* Added `sleep`
  function.\r\n* Added `rotationSpeed` function.\r\n* Added the `shiftHue` color function.\r\n*
  Fixed bugs in circle rendering when going in a clockwise direction.\r\n* Fixed the
  bounds and potential recursion pitfall in internal normalization\r\n  functions.\r\n*
  If rotation left 270 degrees will not turn right 90 degrees and vice versa.\r\n\r\n##
  v0.1.0\r\n\r\nInitial release.\r\n"

description: "Have you ever heard of [Turtle Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics)?\n\nIf
  not, then think of a @turtle@ as a cursor you can program to draw! \n\nTurtle graphics
  are a fantastic introduction to the world of\n  programming and to the syntax of
  a new programming language.\n\n![parallelcircles gif](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/worldturtle-0.2.0.0/docs/docs/images/parallel_circles_animated_300.gif)\n\nThis
  module is a framework built on top \nof [gloss](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss)
  to render turtles\nprogrammed in Haskell as animations. This is primarily aimed
  as a \nteaching tool to beginners - but also, it's cool to draw things!\n\nSee The
  API ref, \"Graphics.WorldTurtle\", for features!\n\nIt's easy to create a new project
  with stack:\n\n> stack new my-worldturtle-project aneilmac/worldturtle\n> cd my-worldturtle-project\n>
  stack build\n> stack exec my-worldturtle-project"
