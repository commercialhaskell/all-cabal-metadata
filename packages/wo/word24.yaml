  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/word24.svg?style=flat)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/word24)


  This library implements 24-bit word and int types suitable for use in vector

  processing.


  Storable implementations are provided, however as they use a size and alignment

  of 3 bytes care should be taken to ensure they are compatible if used in

  conjunction with the FFI.


  These types use unboxed data and GHC primitives, and are unlikely to be

  compatible with other Haskell compilers.


  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


  This library uses the Hackage/Cabal build system.  You will need a working

  Haskell compiler and appropriate build system.  This is most easily met

  by installing the Haskell Platform.  The following command will install

  the library:


  cabal install word24


  This library is pure Haskell, and should install on any system with a suitable

  Haskell compiler with no extra steps required.  In particular, POSIX-compatible,

  Mac OSX, and Windows should all be supported.
