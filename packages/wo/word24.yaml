  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/winterland1989/word24.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/winterland1989/word24)
  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/word24.svg?style=flat)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/word24)

  This library implements 24-bit word and int types suitable for use in vector
  processing.

  Storable implementations are provided, however as they use a size and alignment
  of 3 bytes care should be taken to ensure they are compatible if used in
  conjunction with the FFI.

  These types use unboxed data and GHC primitives, and are unlikely to be
  compatible with other Haskell compilers.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

  This library uses the Hackage/Cabal build system.  You will need a working
  Haskell compiler and appropriate build system.  This is most easily met
  by installing the Haskell Platform.  The following command will install
  the library:

  cabal install word24

  This library is pure Haskell, and should install on any system with a suitable
  Haskell compiler with no extra steps required.  In particular, POSIX-compatible,
  Mac OSX, and Windows should all be supported.
