  # wordpress-auth

  This package is used for validating Cookie data & Nonces from Wordpress.

  You may find it useful if you're trying to serve a Haskell application
  alongside a Wordpress site. By validating the Cookies set by Wordpress, you
  can access the currently logged-in Wordpress user in Haskell without having
  to devise a Wordpress-to-Haskell authentication scheme.

  It includes a generalized authentication function, as well as various
  helpers, validators, & hashers if you'd like to build a custom
  authentication process.

  Servant users may want to just use the `servant-auth-wordpress` package.
