  A program and library to a send WoL Magic Packet, to
  remotely start a computer.

  This program is useful if you have a computer that you
  keep at a friend's house because he has a fast internet
  connection. But he keeps turning the machine off, saying
  that it warms up his room and your not using it anyway.
  But now you need a way to turn the machine back on...

  Usage:

  > $ wol hostname macaddress [portnumber]

  If the hostname is not statically known, you can try using
  LAN broadcast (@255.255.255.255@).
