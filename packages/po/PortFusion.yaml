description: |-
  PortFusion is a minimalistic, cross-platform, transport-layer
  distributed reverse / forward proxy & tunneling solution for TCP
  (RDP, SSH, HTTP(S), (S)FTP, VNC, ...) released under GPLv3.

  A single package that makes the most of each platform by tapping
  into their unique capabilities, combining this power with an
  intuitive interface, beautiful design and Haskell's excellent
  support for unprecedented levels of concurrency and parallelism.

  It strives for the smallest source code size while delivering
  maximum throughput with near zero overhead.
