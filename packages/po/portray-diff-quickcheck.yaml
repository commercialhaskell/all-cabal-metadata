description: |-
  This provides equality assertion functions for QuickCheck that pretty-print
  structural diffs of the values in question, rather than dumping the entire
  alues as part of the counterexamples.  This is useful when comparing very
  large values, since it can otherwise be difficult to tell what changed
  between expected and actual values.
