synopsis: Rendering to pseudo-Haskell syntax
changelog: |
  # 0.3.0 (2022-09-24)

  * Change integral literals to express a preferred base.
  * Change floating-point literals to be pre-converted to digits.
  * Add a representation of infinite and NaN values.
  * Add several utility functions for formatting int and float literals.
  * Add configuration of the Generic functionality to suppress record syntax.
  * Don't use strict fields for the spine of the `Portrayal` tree structure.

  # 0.2.0 (2021-09-17)

  * Split Atom into literals, identifiers, and opaque text.
  * Make operator names and record field names `Ident`s.
  * Special-case `String`s so they don't get formatted as lists of `Char`s.

  # 0.1.1 (2021-09-17)

  Transitional version towards 0.2.0.

  * Add `Name` and `Opaque` pattern synonyms.

  # 0.1.0.0 (2021-09-02)

  Initial version.

description: |-
  This provides a single place to describe how a type should be formatted as
  pseudo-Haskell syntax, independently of the actual pretty-printing library
  (e.g. "pretty", "ansi-wl-pprint", or "prettyprinter") that will ultimately be
  used to render it.  This means packages can cheaply provide integration with
  all pretty-printers by providing an instance of this class, without needing
  to depend on any of them (or their layout algorithms).

  Of course, this comes at the cost of targeting a predeclared set of
  formatting choices.  If there are any egregious omissions, we can always add
  more constructors.

  This library is explicitly not intended to provide a way to express
  /all documents/; only a particular flavor of pseudo-Haskell syntax
  representing values and types.
