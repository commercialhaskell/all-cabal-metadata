  # Changelog for polysemy-zoo
  ## 0.8.0.0 (2022-03-08)
  ### Breaking Changes
  - Removed `Polysemy.IdempotentLowering`, previously deprecated in favor of `Polysemy.Final`.

  ### Other Changes
  - Updated `asyncToIOFinalGlobal` to support `cancel`.

  ## 0.7.0.2 (2020-11-04)
  - Add support for GHC 9.0
    ([#70](https://github.com/polysemy-research/polysemy-zoo/pull/70), thanks to @funketh)

  ## 0.7.0.1 (2020-10-06)
  - As a stop-gap for [#65](https://github.com/polysemy-research/polysemy-zoo/issues/65), the library has been rewritten to no longer use `polysemy-plugin`. This should allow GHC 8.10 users to use the library.

  ## 0.7.0.0 (2020-02-14)
  ### Breaking Changes
  - `Tagged` has been migrated to `polysemy` proper.
  - `Polysemy.Alias` and `InterpreterOf` has been removed in favor of
      `InterpreterFor`, which is now part of `polysemy` proper
      (thanks to @bolt12).
  - Removed `runKVStoreInRedis`, `runSetStoreInRedis`, and `Polysemy.Redis.Utils`
      due to lack of use.

  ### Other Changes
  - Added `MonadThrow` and `MonadCatch` constraint absorbers which operate
      via `Error SomeException` (thanks to @adamConnerSax).
  - Added `Polysemy.Input.Streaming`, which offers
      [streaming](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming) interoperability.
  - Added `Polysemy.Reader.Compact`, which is useful for `Reader` effects
      which provide a large structure (thanks to @spacekitteh).


  ## 0.6.0.1 (2019-09-12)

  - Fixed the implementation of `atomicPut`

  ## 0.6.0.0 (2019-09-05)

  - `Final` has been migrated to `polysemy` proper.
      Only `Polysemy.Final.MTL` and experimental features pertaining to
      `Final` remain in `polysemy-zoo`.
  - Added `Fresh` effect.
  - Added `Tagged` effect.
  - Added `MonadCont` constraint absorber which operates via the `Cont` effect.
  - Added `runContViaFresh`, which is still under development.
  - Added `runReaderFixSem`
  - Added `EndState` effect
  - Added `RevState` effect
  - Added `lowerFinal`
  - Added `runFinalSem`
  - Added `nonDetToFinal`
  - Added `interpretFinalGlobal`
  - Added `asyncToIOFinalGlobal`
  - Added `resourceToIOFinalGlobal`

  ## 0.5.0.1 (2019-07-25)

  - Fixed some bugs with haddock

  ## 0.5.0.0 (2019-07-24)

  - Added Continuation effects (thanks to @KingoftheHomeless)
  - Update to `polysemy-1.0.0.0`'s new names

  ## 0.4.0.1 (2019-07-10)

  - Fixed an erroneous lower bound in the tests

  ## 0.4.0.0 (2019-07-10)

  ### Breaking Changes

  - The semantics of `absorbWriter` are now aligned with the `MTL` implementation

  ### New Effects and Interpreters

  - Added `SetStore` effect
  - Added `Floodgate` effect
  - Added `Final` effect, together with submodules of interpreters using it
      (thanks to @KingoftheHomeless)
  - Added `lookupOrThrowKV`, `existsKV` and `modifyKV` actions to `KVStore`
  - Added Redis interpretations of `SetStore` and `KVStore`

  ## 0.3.0.0 (2019-06-17)

  - Removed `Polysemy.MTL`
  - The machinery for MTL absorption is now monomorphized in
      `Polysemy.ConstraintAbsorber`. See the documentation there and in submodules
      for more information.

  ## 0.2.0.0 (2019-06-14)

  - Removed `Polysemy.RandomFu`, which is moving to its own package
  - Add explicit cabal bounds for dependencies of `polysemy-zoo`

  ## 0.1.2.1 (2019-06-12)

  - Update the tests to run against `polysemy-0.4.0.0`

  ## 0.1.2.0 (2019-06-01)

  - Added `Polysemy.MTL` for inter-op with MTL (thanks to @adamConnerSax)
  - Moved `Polysemy.Random` from `polysemy`
  - Added `Polysemy.RandomFu` (thanks to @adamConnerSax)
  - Added `fixedNat` and `fixedNat'` to `Polysemy.IdempotentLowering` for working
      with higher-order effects.

  ## 0.1.1.0 (2019-05-22)

  - Added `Polysemy.IdempotentLowering`

  ## Overview

  The `polysemy-zoo` is an experimental repository for user-contributed additions
  to the `polysemy` ecosystem. You're encouraged to open Pull Requests here for
  any effects/interpretations that you write and think might be useful for others.

  Particularly successful contributions here will be migrated into either
  `polysemy` proper, or `polysemy-contrib` (the less experimental version of the
  zoo.)


  ## Polysemy in the Wild

  The Zoo isn't the only place to find great user-contributions to `polysemy`!
  Here is a curated list of other great effects and interops:
