  ## Overview

  A typechecker plugin that can disambiguate "obvious" uses of effects in
  [`polysemy`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polysemy).


  ## Example

  Consider the following program:

  ```haskell
  foo :: Member (State Int) r => Sem r ()
  foo = put 10
  ```

  What does this program do? Any human will tell you that it changes the state of
  the `Int` to 10, which is clearly what's meant.

  Unfortunately, `polysemy` can't work this out on its own. Its reasoning is
  "maybe you wanted to change some other `State` effect which is *also* a `Num`,
  but you just forgot to add a `Member` constraint for it."

  This is obviously insane, but it's the way the cookie crumbles.
  `polysemy-plugin` is a typechecker plugin which will disambiguate the above
  program (and others) so the compiler will do what you want.


  ## Usage

  Add the following line to your package configuration:

  ```
  ghc-options: -fplugin=Polysemy.Plugin
  ```


  ## Limitations

  The `polysemy-plugin` will only disambiguate effects if there is exactly one
  relevant constraint in scope. For example, it will *not* disambiguate the
  following program:

  ```haskell
  bar :: Members '[ State Int
                  , State Double
                  ] r => Sem r ()
  bar = put 10
  ```

  because it is now unclear whether you're attempting to set the `Int` or the
  `Double`. Instead, you can manually write a type application in this case.

  ```haskell
  bar :: Members '[ State Int
                  , State Double
                  ] r => Sem r ()
  bar = put @Int 10
  ```
