  # Changelog for polysemy-plugin

  ## 0.2.4.0 (2019-10-29)

  - The plugin now works on GHC 8.8.1 (thanks to @googleson78 and @sevanspowell)
  - Improved error messages for when you forgot to include `polysemy` itself

  ## 0.2.3.0 (2019-09-04)

  - The plugin will now choose between given effects based on the ability to unify them.
      This makes it possible for disambiguation to kick in even when using multiple
      instances of the same effect with different type variables,
      as long as type annotations/applications are used to
      target a specific instance.
  - Updated the test suite to test against `polysemy-1.2.0.0`.

  ## 0.2.2.0 (2019-07-04)

  - The plugin will now prevent some false-positives in `polysemy`'s error
      messages
  - Updated the lower bounds to `polysemy-0.6.0.0`

  ## 0.2.1.1 (2019-06-26)

  - Updated the test suite to test against `polysemy-0.5.0.0`

  ## 0.2.1.0 (2019-06-14)

  - Greatly improved the plugin's ability to unify polymorphic types when running
      interpreters.

  ## 0.2.0.3 (2019-06-13)

  - Fixed a bug where the plugin could (incorrectly) loop indefinitely attempting
      to solve some constraints.
  - Changed the lower-bound of `inspection-testing` to allow Cabal users to
      successfully run the test-suite.

  ## 0.2.0.2 (2019-06-09)

  - Fixed a bug where the plugin wouldn't attempt to unify effects recursively
  - Updated the test suite to test against `polysemy-0.3`

  ## 0.2.0.1 (2019-05-28)

  - Fixed a bug where the plugin would get confused in the context of legitimate
      type errors

  ## 0.2.0.0 (2019-05-23)

  - Fixed a serious bug where the changes from 0.1.0.1 broke most real-world
      usages of polysemy
  - The plugin will now automatically perform the transformation in
      `polysemy`'s `inlineRecursiveCalls` when run with `-O`

  ## 0.1.0.1 (2019-05-18)

  - Added some explicit bounds for cabal
  - Fixed a bug where effects that were too polymorphic would silently be accepted

  ## 0.1.0.0 (2019-04-27)

  - Initial release

  ## Unreleased changes

  - Added `mapError`

  ## Overview

  A typechecker plugin that can disambiguate "obvious" uses of effects in
  [`polysemy`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polysemy).


  ## Example

  Consider the following program:

  ```haskell
  foo :: Member (State Int) r => Sem r ()
  foo = put 10
  ```

  What does this program do? Any human will tell you that it changes the state of
  the `Int` to 10, which is clearly what's meant.

  Unfortunately, `polysemy` can't work this out on its own. Its reasoning is
  "maybe you wanted to change some other `State` effect which is *also* a `Num`,
  but you just forgot to add a `Member` constraint for it."

  This is obviously insane, but it's the way the cookie crumbles.
  `polysemy-plugin` is a typechecker plugin which will disambiguate the above
  program (and others) so the compiler will do what you want.


  ## Usage

  Add the following line to your package configuration:

  ```
  ghc-options: -fplugin=Polysemy.Plugin
  ```


  ## Limitations

  The `polysemy-plugin` will only disambiguate effects if there is exactly one
  relevant constraint in scope. For example, it will *not* disambiguate the
  following program:

  ```haskell
  bar :: Members '[ State Int
                  , State Double
                  ] r => Sem r ()
  bar = put 10
  ```

  because it is now unclear whether you're attempting to set the `Int` or the
  `Double`. Instead, you can manually write a type application in this case.

  ```haskell
  bar :: Members '[ State Int
                  , State Double
                  ] r => Sem r ()
  bar = put @Int 10
  ```
