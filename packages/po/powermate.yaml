  1.0

  * Now works with GHC 7.2.2 - 8.0.1.

  * Added Eq, Ord, Show, and Read instances for Event and Status.

  * Added example programs powermate-print and powermate-pulse.

  * Added documentation.

  * An open PowerMate is now represented by the opaque type 'PowerMate'
    instead of 'Handle'.  A new function 'closeDevice' exists to close
    the opaque 'PowerMate' type.

  * Fixed a bug where the PowerMate would get confused and start
    dropping button presses if you set the LED.

  * Removed extraneous printing to stdout.

  * Removed getUSBName and readEventWithSkip; I didn't see the utility
    in these functions.

  * readEvent no longer returns a Maybe.  There was no meaning to
    'Nothing' and it just had to be ignored.

  * Removed the MPD module.  It wasn't directly related to the PowerMate
    functionality, and the "libmpd" package seems to be an alternative
    which is more complete and better maintained.

  0.1  @  Sun Feb 24 16:34:18 UTC 2008

  * Initial release.

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/powermate.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/powermate)
  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ppelleti/powermate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ppelleti/powermate)

  This library is for interfacing the [Griffin PowerMate USB][1] with
  Haskell on Linux.  Besides reading events from the PowerMate, you
  can also control the brightness, pulse speed, and pulse waveform of
  the built-in LED.

  ([An earlier version of the library][4] also contained an
  implementation of the [MPD][2] protocol.  This was removed, because it
  wasn't directly related to the PowerMate functionality, and the
  [libmpd][3] library seems to be an alternative which is more complete
  and better maintained.)

  Besides the library, this package includes two example programs,
  `powermate-print` and `powermate-pulse`.  `powermate-print` simply
  prints out the events it receives from the PowerMate.
  `powermate-pulse` lets you control the LED pulse speed by
  turning the knob, and change the pulse waveform by clicking the knob.
