description: "# polysemy-readline\n[![GitHub Actions](https://github.com/lehmacdj/polysemy-readline/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lehmacdj/polysemy-readline/actions/workflows/ci.yml)\n[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/polysemy-readline.svg?logo=haskell)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polysemy-readline)\n\nThis
  package provides a [polysemy](https://github.com/polysemy-research/polysemy#readme)
  effect that provides most of the functionality of [haskeline](https://github.com/judah/haskeline#readme).
  See Haskeline's documentation for additional usage information.\n\n## Contributions\nBug
  reports and PRs are welcome. In particular there are a number of things that I don't
  use frequently enough from Haskeline to justify working on or just haven't gotten
  around to implementing yet:\n- interrupt handling: `withInterrupt`, `handleInterrupt`\n-
  pure interpreter for use in tests\n- support for older versions of Haskeline (currently
  only 0.8.1+ is supported)\n- version bumps for dependencies that already compile
  but aren't allowed\n\nPRs for any of these things would be greatly appreciated or
  I will try to get around to implementing them myself later \U0001F642.\n"
