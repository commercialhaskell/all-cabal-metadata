description: |-
  The motivation for this package was to run computations on multiple cores
  that need to write intermediate results to disk.
  The functions restrict the number of simultaneously running jobs
  to a user given number or to the number of capabilities
  the Haskell program was started with,
  i.e. the number after the RTS option @-N@.

  There are some flavors of this functionality:

  * "Control.Concurrent.PooledIO.Independent":
  run independent actions without results in parallel

  * "Control.Concurrent.PooledIO.Final":
  run independent actions with a final result in parallel

  * "Control.Concurrent.PooledIO.InOrder":
  run jobs in parallel with data dependencies like @make -j n@

  Additionally there is the module
  "Control.Concurrent.PooledIO.Sequence"
  that helps to serialize I/O actions from multiple threads.
  It is certainly most useful in connection with
  "Control.Concurrent.PooledIO.Independent".

  Related packages:

  * @lazyio@: interleave IO actions in a single thread

  * @async@: start threads and wait for their results, forward exceptions,
  but do not throttle concurrency with respect to number of available cores

  * @parallel-tasks@:

  * @parallel-io@:

  * @threadPool@:

  * @threads-pool@:

  * @cio@:

  * @Control-Engine@:

  * @taskpool@, @async-pool@:
