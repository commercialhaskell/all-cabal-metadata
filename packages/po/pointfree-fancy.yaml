description: "Pointfree refactoring tool\n==========================\n\nStand-alone
  command-line version of the point-less plugin for lambdabot. \nDetailed information
  about the use of this tool is available at \nhttp://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Pointfree.\n\nIntegration
  with GHCi: Make sure that the directory containing the pointfree \nexecutable is
  in your PATH environment variable and add the following line to \nyour GHCi configuration
  file:\n\n:def pf \\str -> return $ \":! pointfree \\\"\" ++ str ++ \"\\\"\"\n\nOr
  modify the line to point directly to the executable. Invoke pointfree with \ncommands
  like\n\n:pf \\x y -> x + y\n\nFuture directions\n=================\n\nIt would be
  nice to make pointfree a library that operated on ASTs.\n"
