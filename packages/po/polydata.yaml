description: ! 'This package, together with its dependency [polydata-core](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polydata-core),

  allows one to pass data, particularly functions, together with a constraint which
  describes how

  polymorphic that data is. This constraint can then be used in a generic way to produce
  quite polymorphic functions,

  for example, a "map" function that works on a pair of two different types.


  See [Data.Poly](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polydata-core/docs/Data-Poly.html)

  for a basic tutorial.'
