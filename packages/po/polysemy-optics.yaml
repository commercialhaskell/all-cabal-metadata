  Usage
  =====

  Simply import `Optics.Polysemy`. This serves as a drop-in replacement for
  `Optics`, `Optics.State`, and `Optics.State.Operators`.

  Caveats
  =======

  As best I can tell, the `zoom` functions cannot currently be translated with
  complete precision. As a result, only a few `zoom` functions are present here,
  and they behave a little strangely.
  * If you use `zoom` or `zoomMaybe` to go from `State s` to `State a`, the
    original `State s` will still be present in your effect stack. Writes to the
    zoomed part of the `s` will be visible from inside the `State a`, and
    vice-versa.
  * `zoomMany` cannot be sensibly implemented this way, so I have left it out.
  * Due to difficulties with higher-order effects, I have not yet found a way to
    implement the `magnify` functions.
