  # Change Log

  Notable changes to the project will be documented in this file.

  The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) and the
  project adheres to the [Haskell Package Versioning
  Policy (PVP)](https://pvp.haskell.org)

  ## [unreleased]

  ## [1.0.0.1] - 2022-06-16

  ### Changed

  - Stack configuration files have been created for Stackage LTS version with GHC 8.6 up to 9.2
  - Dependency version requirements have been widened to allow the versions from these Stackage sets.
  - In order to support GHC 9.2, `Nat` is now imported from `GHC.Typelits` instead of `GHC.Base`

  ## [1.0.0.0] - 2022-06-08

  This is the initial release of the library.

  ### Added

  - The POSable class, which captures non-recursive Haskell 98 data types as a product-of-sums
  - A generic implementation of the POSable class, based on the generics-sop library
  - A usage example (in examples/Examples.hs)
  - Instances of POSable for data types in the Prelude (Bool, Maybe, Either, Ord, tuples up to length 16)

  # POSable

  A library to convert non-recursive Haskell-98 datatypes to a Product-of-Sums
  representation - and back. This makes it possible to compactly store arrays of
  (nested) sum types in a struct-of-arrays representation, which is used in
  array-based languages like [Accelerate].

  [Accelerate]: https://www.acceleratehs.org/

  ## Dependencies

  - The [Stack] package manager (Tested with stack 2.7.3)
  - `stylish-haskell` and `hlint` (for linting only)

  [Stack]: https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/

  ## Tests and lints

  ``` bash
  stylish-haskell -r src examples test
  hlint src examples test
  stack test
  ```

  ## Building

  ``` bash
  stack build
  # To build the docs
  stack haddock posable
  ```

  ## Examples

  In the [examples](examples) folder you will find examples that describe how to use this
  library.
