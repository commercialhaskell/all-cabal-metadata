  # Changelog for polysemy-check

  ## v0.6.0.0 (2021-10-16)

  - Changed the frequencies of `Sem`'s `Arbitrary` instance, to create more
      interesting programs.
  - Removed the program generator parameter of `prepropEquivalent`. It now just
      uses the `Arbitrary` instance for `Sem`.
  - Added some new examples to the test suite.

  ## v0.5.0.0 (2021-10-14)

  - Flattened the module structure of `Polysemy.Check.Arbitrary`.
  - Fixed a bug where `arbitraryActionFromRowOfType` would return bottom.
  - Added an `Arbitrary` instance for `Sem r a`.
  - Added tests to prove all generators have a uniform distribution for actions.
  - `prepropLaw` now prints the actions it ran before and after your test.
  - Changed the orphan `Show` instances for standard Polysemy effects to more
      easily be used for testing coverage.
  - Added a `Show` instance for `SomeEffOfType`.
  - (Internal) Removed the `GArbitraryKTerm` class

  ## v0.4.0.0 (2021-10-12)

  - `GArbitraryK` now supports actions that contain existential types.
  - (Internal) Aggressively rewrote the `GArbitraryK` typeclass to make better use
      of `kind-generics`.

  ## v0.3.0.0 (2021-10-09)

  - `prepropLaw` now synthesizes a monadic prelude and postlude to your laws, to
      ensure they hold under every context. The type has changed as a result.
  - `prepropEquivalent` now allows you to produce a functor `f` result, so you can
      check equivalence of the underlying state as well.

  ## v0.2.0.0 (2021-10-09)

  - Updated the signature of `prepropEquivalent` to take a `Proxy r`. This lets
      you bind the `r` type variable, and use it as an argument to
      `arbitraryAction` et al.

  ## v0.1.0.0 (2021-10-08)

  - Released!

  ## Overview

  `polysemy-check` is a little package that integrates
  [`polysemy`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polysemy) with
  [`QuickCheck`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck). It allows you to
  prove the equivalence of effects (see `prepropLaw`), the equivalence of
  interpreters (`prepropEquivalent`), and that two effects don't affect one
  another (`prepropCommutative`). These three things are about the only problems
  you could possibly run into with Polysemy --- and now you won't.

  In addition `polysemy-check` provides lots of machinery to help avoid
  boilerplate, such as free `Arbitrary` instances for effects.


  ## Usage

  `polysemy-check` requires a `Show` and `GenericK` instance for every effect
  you'd like to run tests over.

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}

  import Polysemy
  import Polysemy.Check

  data Stack m a where
    Push :: Int -> Stack m ()
    Pop  :: Stack m (Maybe Int)
    Size :: Stack m Int

  deriving instance Show (Stack m a)
  makeSem ''Stack
  deriveGenericK ''Stack
  ```
