  # Changelog for polysemy-check

  ## v0.2.0.0 (2021-10-09)

  - Updated the signature of `prepropEquivalent` to take a `Proxy r`. This lets
      you bind the `r` type variable, and use it as an argument to
      `arbitraryAction` et al.

  ## v0.1.0.0 (2021-10-08)

  - Released!

  ## Overview

  `polysemy-check` is a little package that integrates
  [`polysemy`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polysemy) with
  [`QuickCheck`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck). It allows you to
  prove the equivalence of effects (see `prepropLaw`), the equivalence of
  interpreters (`prepropEquivalent`), and that two effects don't affect one
  another (`prepropCommutative`). These three things are about the only problems
  you could possibly run into with Polysemy --- and now you won't.

  In addition `polysemy-check` provides lots of machinery to help avoid
  boilerplate, such as free `Arbitrary` instances for effects.


  ## Usage

  `polysemy-check` requires a `Show` and `GenericK` instance for every effect
  you'd like to run tests over.

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}

  import Polysemy
  import Polysemy.Check

  data Stack m a where
    Push :: Int -> Stack m ()
    Pop  :: Stack m (Maybe Int)
    Size :: Stack m Int

  deriving instance Show (Stack m a)
  makeSem ''Stack
  deriveGenericK ''Stack
  ```
