description: "polynomial-algebra Haskell library\n==================================\n\nThis
  is a Haskell library to compute with multivariate polynomials.\n\nPolynomials are
  implemented as free modules (with a coefficient ring)\nover the monoid of monomials.
  The free module implementation is basically\na map from monomials to coefficients,
  with the invariant that zero \ncoefficients should be never present. Different implementations
  of monomials\nare available with different speed and usability tradeoffs:\n\n* generic
  monomial over a variable set given by inhabitants of a type\n* monomials over x1,
  x2 ... xn (two different in-memory representations)\n* monomials over an infinite
  number of variables x1, x2, ...\n* univariate monomial (basically, an integer exponent)\n*
  exterior monomial (for exterior algebra)\n\nType level parameters are used for the
  variable names (used for pretty-printing)\nand number of variables where possible.\n\nA
  type class interface allows the user to work uniformly over different\nimplementations."
