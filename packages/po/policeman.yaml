description: "# Policeman\n\n![logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4276606/73312656-262c1a80-4221-11ea-83c3-87b3973fa27f.png)\n\n[![GitHub
  CI](https://github.com/kowainik/policeman/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kowainik/policeman/actions)\n[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/policeman.svg?logo=haskell)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/policeman)\n[![MPL-2.0
  license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MPL--2.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)\n\n\n\U0001F46E
  Policeman is the Kowainik's\n[Bristol Haskell Hackathon](https://mpickering.github.io/bristol2020.html)\nproject.\n\n\U0001F3D7
  The current status is MVP, though it could already be used on ordinary cases.\n\n`Policeman`
  assists to properly choose the next version number according to\n[PVP]() (Packaging
  Version Policy) for the Haskell packages based on the\nsemantical changes to the
  interface.\n\nFor a better understanding of the project basis and implementation
  details\nplease refer to the following blog post:\n\n* [Kowainik: Policeman in da
  city](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/policeman-bristol)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nPoliceman
  heavily uses some modern features of the Haskell compiler\n[GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/).\nTherefore,
  in order to start using `Policeman` on the projects, you are required\nto have the
  following set:\n\n * Global GHC version `8.8` and higher\n * Support of GHC `8.8`
  and higher in your current project and the version you\n   wish to compare to\n
  * [cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) build tool version `3.0` or higher\n   installed
  on your machine\n\n## Installation\n\nThe initial beta version of `Policeman` is
  already available on Hackage.\nTo install it locally you need to execute the following
  commands:\n\n```shell\ncabal update\ncabal install policeman\n```\n\nAlternatively,
  you can install the `Policeman` tool from the sources. For\nachieving that, you
  have a couple of options.\n\nFirst one is to fetch the repo using `cabal`:\n\n```shell\ncabal
  get -s policeman\n```\n\nOr, you can clone the directory directly from GitHub:\n\n```shell\ngit
  clone https://github.com/kowainik/policeman.git\n```\n\nThe next steps are identical
  in both option. You need to step into the\ndirectory:\n\n```shell\ncd policeman\n```\n\nAnd
  finally, build and install the tool using `cabal`:\n\n```shell\ncabal install policeman:exe:policeman\n```\n\n##
  How to use\n\nBy default, Policeman aims to compare your local version with the
  latest\navailable Hackage version of the package. It grabs the information about
  your\npackage automatically, so no need to provide that. That means that the simplest\ncommand
  looks like this:\n\n```shell\npoliceman\n```\n\nIt will output the suggested new
  version (if applicable) based on your local\nchanges compared to the Hackage version.\n\nAlternatively,
  you can provide the Hackage version you are willing to compare\nagainst. For that
  purpose, you can use `-p | --previous` option. For example:\n\n```shell\npoliceman
  --previous \"0.1.0.0\"\n```\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nIcons made by [Freepik](http://www.freepik.com)
