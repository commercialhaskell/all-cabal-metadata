  # polysemy-fs

  This package offers small filesystem effects for polysemy, such as:

  ```
  data FSExist m a where
    DoesFileExist :: Path b File -> FSExist m Bool
    DoesDirExist  :: Path b Dir  -> FSExist m Bool
  ```

  It should be noted that these are very weak semantic abstractions, as it does
  not provide a way to speak to the filesystem as a whole, and therefore is
  somewhat unsuitable for mocking. These effects exist primarily to give
  interpreters a way to be precise in the type of filesystem operations they use,
  and should be treated in the same way as `Embed IO` in that regard. However, if
  you need a quick fix - then using this directly in application code is a slight
  improvement over using `Embed IO` directly.

  Using these as very low level compilation units allows you to inject debugging
  everywhere you use a filesystem operation. For example, using [co-log-polysemy](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/co-log-polysemy) we can do this:

  ```
  data FileExists where
    FileExists    :: Path b File -> FileExists
    FileNotExists :: Path b File -> FileExists

  data DirExists where
    DirExists    :: Path b Dir -> DirExists
    DirNotExists :: Path b Dir -> DirExists

  logFileExists :: Members '[FSExist, Log FileExists] r => Sem r a -> Sem r a
  logFileExists = intercept \case
    DoesFileExist x -> do
      z <- doesFileExist x
      case z of
        True  -> log $ FileExists x
        False -> log $ FileNotExists x
      return z
    DoesDirExist x -> doesDirExist x

  logDirExists :: Members '[FSExist, Log DirExists] r => Sem r a -> Sem r a
  logDirExists = intercept \case
    DoesDirExist x  -> do
      z <- doesDirExist x
      case z of
        True  -> log $ DirExists x
        False -> log $ DirNotExists x
      return z
    DoesFileExist x -> doesFileExist x
  ```
