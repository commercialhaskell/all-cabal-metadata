  ## positive-integer

  Haskell library to work with positive integers (i.e. 1, 2, 3, ...).
  Some people call these the natural numbers.
  However, others include 0 as a natural number.
  The term _positive integer_ is always clear.
  Besides, `Natural` is a widely used type in Haskell (and it _has_ 0 in it).

  In addition to functions strictly related to positive integers,
  functions for non-empty lists that take advantage of having positive
  integers available are also included.
  See Haddock documentation
  [on Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/positive-integer)
  for details.
