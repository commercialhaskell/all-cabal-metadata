description: |-
  Provides an alternative implementation of the 'Prelude.lines' function that
  treats the following sequences as newline characters:

  * @\"\\r\\n\"@ (Windows style)

  * @\"\\r\"@ (Macintosh style, before OS X)

  * @\"\\n\"@ (Unix style)

  Haskell's IO system supports both platform-specific line ending conversion
  (by opening the file in \"text mode\"), and explicit setting of the newline
  mode for input and output (see 'System.IO.hSetNewlineMode').  However:

  * If you don't know the line ending format in advance, you would have to
  open the file and detect the newline format manually.

  * ByteString currently honors neither of these; see
  <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6837628>.
