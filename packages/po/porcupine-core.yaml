description: |-
  porcupine is centered around the PTask datatype, which represents a
  computation that will request access to some resources (both in read and write
  modes) and require some options (parameters, with docstrings and default
  values). PTasks are composable both sequentially and in parallel, into a
  pipeline of tasks. The resources and parameters are organized in a tree which
  will be automatically exposed to the outside world. This makes the pipeline
  self-documented, and makes it so any option or file required at some point by
  any task can be visualized and set/remapped (via a combination of a YAML/JSON
  config file and command-line arguments) before the pipeline will run. That
  means that the PTasks are completely agnostic of their data inputs, and that
  new data sources can be added without having to change any of the tasks' logic
  or even their types. This is done via the LocationAccessor
  typeclass. `porcupine-core` provides only access to local files (via
  resourcet), other location accessors will be in separate packages. See for
  instance the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/porcupine-http
  `porcupine-http`> package to access HTTP urls. PTasks also provide caching
  thanks to the funflow package. See the README at
  <https://github.com/tweag/porcupine#README.md> and the examples in
  `porcupine-core` package.
