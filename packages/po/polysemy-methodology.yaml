  # polysemy-methodology

  polysemy-methodology provides an algebra for domain modelling in polysemy.

  A simple program might look something like this:

  ```
  prog :: Members '[ Input a
                   , Methodology a b
                   , Output b]
  prog = input @a >>= process @a @b >>= output @b
  ```

  That is, this program transforms an `Input a` into an `Output b` by way of a
  `Methodology a b` that turns `a` into `b`. We can then type apply `a` and `b`
  and connect this to `main`.

  If we have a solution readily available, we can consume a `Methodology` by
  running one of the interpreters `runMethodologyPure` or `runMethodologySem`.

  Otherwise, we can use the other interpreters in this package to break the
  problem down into components or branches and solve each section separately.
  Each interpreter will produce a new set of `Methodology`s to be solved.

  This allows you to work up a solution to a domain problem backwards, by running
  the program you intend to solve directly and using holes to guide the
  requirements.
