  # Changelog for polysemy

  ## 1.2.1.0 (2019-09-15)

  - Added `InterpreterFor` (thanks to @bolt12)
  - Bumped bounds for first-class-families

  ## 1.2.0.0 (2019-09-04)

  ### Breaking Changes

  - All `lower-` interpreters have been deprecated, in favor of corresponding
      `-Final` interpreters.
  - `runFixpoint` and `runFixpointM` have been deprecated in favor of
      `fixpointToFinal`.
  - The semantics for `runNonDet` when `<|>` is used inside a higher-order action
      of another effect has been changed.
  - Type variables for certain internal functions, `failToEmbed`, and
      `atomicState'` have been rearranged.

  ## Other changes

  - Added `Final` effect, an effect for embedding higher-order actions in the
      final monad of the effect stack. Any interpreter should use this instead of
      requiring to be provided an explicit lowering function to the final monad.
  - Added `Strategy` environment for use together with `Final`
  - Added `asyncToIOFinal`, a better alternative of `lowerAsync`
  - Added `errorToIOFinal`, a better alternative of `lowerError`
  - Added `fixpointToFinal`, a better alternative of `runFixpoint` and `runFixpointM`
  - Added `resourceToIOFinal`, a better alternative of `lowerResource`
  - Added `outputToIOMonoid` and `outputToIOMonoidAssocR`
  - Added `stateToIO`
  - Added `atomicStateToIO`
  - Added `runWriterTVar`, `writerToIOFinal`, and `writerToIOAssocRFinal`
  - Added `writerToEndoWriter`
  - Added `subsume` operation
  - Exposed `raiseUnder`/`2`/`3` in `Polysemy`


  ## 1.1.0.0 (2019-08-15)

  ### Breaking Changes

  - `MonadFail` is now implemented in terms of `Fail`, instead of `NonDet` (thanks to @KingoftheHomeless)
  - `LastMember` has been removed. `withLowerToIO` and all interpreters that make use of it
      now only requires `Member (Embed IO) r` (thanks to @KingoftheHomeless)
  - `State` and `Writer` now have better strictness semantics

  ### Other Changes

  - Added `AtomicState` effect (thanks to @KingoftheHomeless)
  - Added `Fail` effect (thanks to @KingoftheHomeless)
  - Added `runOutputSem` (thanks to @cnr)

  - Added right-associative variants of `runOutputMonoid` and `runWriter` (thanks to @KingoftheHomeless)
  - Added `runOutputMonoidIORef` and `runOutputMonoidTVar` (thanks to @KingoftheHomeless)
  - Improved `Fixpoint` so it won't always diverge (thanks to @KingoftheHomeless)
  - `makeSem` will now complain if `DataKinds` isn't enabled (thanks to @pepegar)

  Dedication\n\n> The word 'good' has many meanings. For example, if a man were to
  shoot his\n> grandmother at a range of five hundred yards, I should call him a good
  shot,\n> but not necessarily a good man.\n>\n> Gilbert K. Chesterton\n\n\n## Overview\n\n`polysemy`
  is a library for writing high-power, low-boilerplate, zero-cost,\ndomain specific
  languages. It allows you to separate your business logic from\nyour implementation
  details. And in doing so, `polysemy` lets you turn your\nimplementation code into
  reusable library code.\n\nIt's like `mtl` but composes better, requires less boilerplate,
  and avoids the\nO(n^2) instances problem.\n\nIt's like `freer-simple` but more powerful
  and 35x faster.\n\nIt's like `fused-effects` but with an order of magnitude less
  boilerplate.\n\nAdditionally, unlike `mtl`, `polysemy` has no functional dependencies,
  so you\ncan use multiple copies of the same effect. This alleviates the need for
  ~~ugly\nhacks~~ band-aids like [classy\nlenses](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-4.17.1/docs/Control-Lens-TH.html#v:makeClassy),\nthe
  [`ReaderT`\npattern](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2017/06/readert-design-pattern)
  and\nnicely solves the [trouble with typed\nerrors](https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2018/11/03/trouble_with_typed_errors.html).\n\nConcerned
  about type inference? Check out\n[polysemy-plugin](https://github.com/isovector/polysemy/tree/master/polysemy-plugin),\nwhich
  should perform just as well as `mtl`'s! Add `polysemy-plugin` to your package.yaml\nor
  .cabal file's dependencies section to use. Then turn it on with a pragma in your
  source-files:\n\n```haskell\n{-# OPTIONS_GHC -fplugin=Polysemy.Plugin #-}\n```\nOr
  by adding `-fplugin=Polysemy.Plugin` to your package.yaml/.cabal file `ghc-options`
  section.\n\n\n## Features\n\n* *Effects are higher-order,* meaning it's trivial
  to write `bracket` and `local`\n    as first-class effects.\n* *Effects are low-boilerplate,*
  meaning you can create new effects in a\n    single-digit number of lines. New interpreters
  are nothing but functions and\n    pattern matching.\n* *Effects are zero-cost,*
  meaning that GHC<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup> can optimize\n    away the entire abstraction
  at compile time.\n\n\n<sup><a name=\"fn1\">1</a></sup>: Unfortunately this is not
  true in GHC 8.6.3, but\nwill be true in GHC 8.10.1.\n\n## Tutorial\n\nRaghu Kaippully
  wrote a beginner friendly [tutorial](https://haskell-explained.gitlab.io/blog/posts/2019/07/28/polysemy-is-cool-part-1/index.html).\n\n##
  Examples\n\nMake sure you read the [Necessary Language\nExtensions](https://github.com/isovector/polysemy#necessary-language-extensions)\nbefore
  trying these yourself!\n\nTeletype effect:\n\n```haskell\n{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell
  #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE LambdaCase, BlockArguments #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE GADTs, FlexibleContexts,
  TypeOperators, DataKinds, PolyKinds #-}\n\nimport Polysemy\nimport Polysemy.Input\nimport
  Polysemy.Output\n\ndata Teletype m a where\n  ReadTTY  :: Teletype m String\n  WriteTTY
  :: String -> Teletype m ()\n\nmakeSem ''Teletype\n\nteletypeToIO :: Member (Embed
  IO) r => Sem (Teletype ': r) a -> Sem r a\nteletypeToIO = interpret $ \\case\n  ReadTTY
  \     -> embed getLine\n  WriteTTY msg -> embed $ putStrLn msg\n\nrunTeletypePure
  :: [String] -> Sem (Teletype ': r) a -> Sem r ([String], a)\nrunTeletypePure i\n
  \ = runOutputMonoid pure  -- For each WriteTTY in our program, consume an output
  by appending it to the list in a ([String], a)\n  . runInputList i         -- Treat
  each element of our list of strings as a line of input\n  . reinterpret2 \\case
  \    -- Reinterpret our effect in terms of Input and Output\n      ReadTTY -> maybe
  \"\" id <$> input\n      WriteTTY msg -> output msg\n\n\necho :: Member Teletype
  r => Sem r ()\necho = do\n  i <- readTTY\n  case i of\n    \"\" -> pure ()\n    _
  \ -> writeTTY i >> echo\n\n\n-- Let's pretend\nechoPure :: [String] -> Sem '[] ([String],
  ())\nechoPure = flip runTeletypePure echo\n\npureOutput :: [String] -> [String]\npureOutput
  = fst . run . echoPure\n\n-- echo forever\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = runM . teletypeToIO
  $ echo\n```\n\n\nResource effect:\n\n```haskell\n{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}\n{-#
  LANGUAGE LambdaCase, BlockArguments #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE GADTs, FlexibleContexts, TypeOperators,
  DataKinds, PolyKinds, TypeApplications #-}\n\nimport Polysemy\nimport Polysemy.Input\nimport
  Polysemy.Output\nimport Polysemy.Error\nimport Polysemy.Resource\n\n-- Using Teletype
  effect from above\n\ndata CustomException = ThisException | ThatException deriving
  Show\n\nprogram :: Members '[Resource, Teletype, Error CustomException] r => Sem
  r ()\nprogram = catch @CustomException work $ \\e -> writeTTY (\"Caught \" ++ show
  e)\n  where work = bracket (readTTY) (const $ writeTTY \"exiting bracket\") $ \\input
  -> do\n          writeTTY \"entering bracket\"\n          case input of\n            \"explode\"
  \    -> throw ThisException\n            \"weird stuff\" -> writeTTY input >> throw
  ThatException\n            _             -> writeTTY input >> writeTTY \"no exceptions\"\n\nmain
  :: IO (Either CustomException ())\nmain =\n    runFinal\n  . embedToFinal @IO\n
  \ . resourceToIOFinal\n  . errorToIOFinal @CustomException\n  . teletypeToIO\n  $
  program\n```\n\nEasy.\n\n\n## Friendly Error Messages\n\nFree monad libraries aren't
  well known for their ease-of-use. But following in\nthe shoes of `freer-simple`,
  `polysemy` takes a serious stance on providing\nhelpful error messages.\n\nFor example,
  the library exposes both the `interpret` and `interpretH`\ncombinators. If you use
  the wrong one, the library's got your back:\n\n```haskell\nrunResource\n    :: forall
  r a\n     . Sem (Resource ': r) a\n    -> Sem r a\nrunResource = interpret $ \\case\n
  \ ...\n```\n\nmakes the helpful suggestion:\n\n```\n    • 'Resource' is higher-order,
  but 'interpret' can help only\n      with first-order effects.\n      Fix:\n        use
  'interpretH' instead.\n    • In the expression:\n        interpret\n          $
  \\case\n```\n\nLikewise it will give you tips on what to do if you forget a `TypeApplication`\nor
  forget to handle an effect.\n\nDon't like helpful errors? That's OK too --- just
  flip the `error-messages` flag\nand enjoy the raw, unadulterated fury of the typesystem.\n\n\n##
  Necessary Language Extensions\n\nYou're going to want to stick all of this into
  your `package.yaml` file.\n\n```yaml\n  ghc-options: -O2 -flate-specialise -fspecialise-aggressively\n
  \ default-extensions:\n    - DataKinds\n    - FlexibleContexts\n    - GADTs\n    -
  LambdaCase\n    - PolyKinds\n    - RankNTypes\n    - ScopedTypeVariables\n    -
  TypeApplications\n    - TypeOperators\n    - TypeFamilies\n```\n\n## Stellar Engineering
  - Aligning the stars to optimize `polysemy` away\n\nSeveral things need to be in
  place to fully realize our performance goals: \n\n- GHC Version\n  - GHC 8.9+\n-
  Your code\n  - The module you want to be optimized needs to import `Polysemy.Internal`
  somewhere in its dependency tree (sufficient to `import Polysemy`)\n- GHC Flags\n
  \ - `-O` or `-O2`\n  - `-flate-specialise` (this should be automatically turned
  on by the plugin, but it's worth mentioning)\n- Plugin\n  - `-fplugin=Polysemy.Plugin`\n-
  Additional concerns:\n  - additional core passes (turned on by the plugin)\n\n"
