  # Changelog for polysemy

  ## 0.5.1.0 (2019-06-28)

  - New combinators for `Polysemy.Error`: `fromEither` and `fromEitherM`

  ## 0.5.0.1 (2019-06-27)

  - Fixed a bug where `intercept` and `interceptH` wouldn't correctly handle
      higher-order effects

  ## 0.5.0.0 (2019-06-26)

  ### Breaking Changes

  - Removed the internal `Effect` machinery

  ### New Effects and Interpretations

  - New effect; `Async`, for describing asynchronous computations
  - New interpretation for `Resource`: `runResourceBase`, which can lower
      `Resource` effects without giving a lowering natural transformation
  - New interpretation for `Trace`: `runTraceAsList`
  - New combinator: `withLowerToIO`, which is capable of transforming
      `IO`-invariant functions as effects.

  ### Other Changes

  - Lots of hard work on the package and CI infrastructure to make it green on
      GHC 8.4.4 (thanks to @jkachmar)
  - Changed the order of the types for `runMonadicInput` to be more helpful
      (thanks to @tempname11)
  - Improved the error machinery to be more selective about when it runs
  - Factored out the TH into a common library for third-party consumers

  ## 0.4.0.0 (2019-06-12)

  ### Breaking Changes

  - Renamed `runResource` to `runResourceInIO`

  ### Other Changes

  - Added `runResource`, which runs a `Resource` purely
  - Added `onException`, `finally` and `bracketOnError` to `Resource`
  - Added a new function, `runResource` which performs bracketing for pure code

  ## 0.3.0.1 (2019-06-09)

  - Fixed a type error in the benchmark caused by deprecation of `Semantic`

  ## 0.3.0.0 (2019-06-01)

  ### Breaking Changes

  - Removed all deprecated names
  - Moved `Random` effect to `polysemy-zoo`

  ### Other Changes

  - `makeSem` can now be used to create term-level operators (thanks to
      @TheMatten)

  ## 0.2.2.0 (2019-05-30)

  - Added `getInspectorT` to the `Tactical` functions, which allows polysemy code
      to be run in external callbacks
  - A complete rewrite of `Polysemy.Internal.TH.Effect` (thanks to @TheMatten)
  - Fixed a bug in the TH generation of effects where the splices could contain
      usages of effects that were ambiguous

  ## 0.2.1.0 (2019-05-27)

  - Fixed a bug in the `Alternative` instance for `Sem`, where it would choose the
      *last* success instead of the first
  - Added `MonadPlus` and `MonadFail` instances for `Sem`

  ## 0.2.0.0 (2019-05-23)

  ### Breaking Changes

  - Lower precedence of `.@` and `.@@` to 8, from 9

  ### Other Changes

  - Fixed a serious bug in `interpretH` and friends, where higher-order effects
      would always be run with the current interpreter.
  - Users need no longer require `inlineRecursiveCalls` --- the
      `polysemy-plugin-0.2.0.0` will do  it automatically when compiling with `-O`
  - Deprecated `inlineRecursiveCalls`; slated for removal in the next version

  ## 0.1.2.1 (2019-05-18)

  - Give explicit package bounds for dependencies
  - Haddock improvements
  - Remove `Typeable` machinery from `Polysemy.Internal.Union` (thanks to
      @googleson78)

  ## 0.1.2.0 (2019-04-26)

  - `runInputAsReader`, `runTraceAsOutput` and `runOutputAsWriter` have more
      generalized types
  - Added `runStateInIO`
  - Added `runOutputAsTrace`
  - Added `Members` (thanks to @TheMatten)


  ## 0.1.1.0 (2019-04-14)

  ## Overview

  `polysemy` is a library for writing high-power, low-boilerplate, zero-cost,
  domain specific languages. It allows you to separate your business logic from
  your implementation details. And in doing so, `polysemy` lets you turn your
  implementation code into reusable library code.

  It's like `mtl` but composes better, requires less boilerplate, and avoids the
  O(n^2) instances problem.

  It's like `freer-simple` but more powerful and 35x faster.

  It's like `fused-effects` but with an order of magnitude less boilerplate.

  Additionally, unlike `mtl`, `polysemy` has no functional dependencies, so you
  can use multiple copies of the same effect. This alleviates the need for ~~ugly
  hacks~~ band-aids like [classy
  lenses](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-4.17.1/docs/Control-Lens-TH.html#v:makeClassy),
  the [`ReaderT`
  pattern](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2017/06/readert-design-pattern) and
  nicely solves the [trouble with typed
  errors](https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2018/11/03/trouble_with_typed_errors.html).

  Concerned about type inference? Check out
  [polysemy-plugin](https://github.com/isovector/polysemy/tree/master/polysemy-plugin),
  which should perform just as well as `mtl`'s! Add `polysemy-plugin` to your package.yaml
  or .cabal file's dependencies section to use. Then turn it on with a pragma in your source-files:

  ```haskell
  {-# OPTIONS_GHC -fplugin=Polysemy.Plugin #-}
  ```
  Or by adding `-fplugin=Polysemy.Plugin` to your package.yaml/.cabal file `ghc-options` section.


  ## Features

  * *Effects are higher-order,* meaning it's trivial to write `bracket` and `local`
      as first-class effects.
  * *Effects are low-boilerplate,* meaning you can create new effects in a
      single-digit number of lines. New interpreters are nothing but functions and
      pattern matching.
  * *Effects are zero-cost,* meaning that GHC<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup> can optimize
      away the entire abstraction at compile time.


  <sup><a name="fn1">1</a></sup>: Unfortunately this is not true in GHC 8.6.3, but
  will be true in GHC 8.10.1.


  ## Examples

  Make sure you read the [Necessary Language
  Extensions](https://github.com/isovector/polysemy#necessary-language-extensions)
  before trying these yourself!

  Teletype effect:

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE LambdaCase, BlockArguments #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE GADTs, FlexibleContexts, TypeOperators, DataKinds, PolyKinds #-}

  import Polysemy
  import Polysemy.Input
  import Polysemy.Output

  data Teletype m a where
    ReadTTY  :: Teletype m String
    WriteTTY :: String -> Teletype m ()

  makeSem ''Teletype

  runTeletypeIO :: Member (Lift IO) r => Sem (Teletype ': r) a -> Sem r a
  runTeletypeIO = interpret $ \case
    ReadTTY      -> sendM getLine
    WriteTTY msg -> sendM $ putStrLn msg

  runTeletypePure :: [String] -> Sem (Teletype ': r) a -> Sem r ([String], a)
  runTeletypePure i
    = runFoldMapOutput pure  -- For each WriteTTY in our program, consume an output by appending it to the list in a ([String], a)
    . runListInput i         -- Treat each element of our list of strings as a line of input
    . reinterpret2 \case     -- Reinterpret our effect in terms of Input and Output
        ReadTTY -> maybe "" id <$> input
        WriteTTY msg -> output msg


  echo :: Member Teletype r => Sem r ()
  echo = do
    i <- readTTY
    case i of
      "" -> pure ()
      _  -> writeTTY i >> echo


  -- Let's pretend
  echoPure :: [String] -> Sem '[] ([String], ())
  echoPure = flip runTeletypePure echo

  pureOutput :: [String] -> [String]
  pureOutput = fst . run . echoPure

  -- Now let's do things
  echoIO :: Sem '[Lift IO] ()
  echoIO = runTeletypeIO echo

  -- echo forever
  main :: IO ()
  main = runM echoIO
  ```


  Resource effect:

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE LambdaCase, BlockArguments #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE GADTs, FlexibleContexts, TypeOperators, DataKinds, PolyKinds, TypeApplications #-}

  import Polysemy
  import Polysemy.Input
  import Polysemy.Output
  import Polysemy.Error
  import Polysemy.Resource

  -- Using Teletype effect from above

  data CustomException = ThisException | ThatException deriving Show

  program :: Members '[Resource, Teletype, Error CustomException] r => Sem r ()
  program = catch @CustomException work $ \e -> writeTTY ("Caught " ++ show e)
    where work = bracket (readTTY) (const $ writeTTY "exiting bracket") $ \input -> do
            writeTTY "entering bracket"
            case input of
              "explode"     -> throw ThisException
              "weird stuff" -> writeTTY input >> throw ThatException
              _             -> writeTTY input >> writeTTY "no exceptions"

  main :: IO (Either CustomException ())
  main = (runM .@ runResourceInIO .@@ runErrorInIO @CustomException) . runTeletypeIO $ program
  ```

  Easy.


  ## Friendly Error Messages

  Free monad libraries aren't well known for their ease-of-use. But following in
  the shoes of `freer-simple`, `polysemy` takes a serious stance on providing
  helpful error messages.

  For example, the library exposes both the `interpret` and `interpretH`
  combinators. If you use the wrong one, the library's got your back:

  ```haskell
  runResource
      :: forall r a
       . Sem (Resource ': r) a
      -> Sem r a
  runResource = interpret $ \case
    ...
  ```

  makes the helpful suggestion:

  ```
      • 'Resource' is higher-order, but 'interpret' can help only
        with first-order effects.
        Fix:
          use 'interpretH' instead.
      • In the expression:
          interpret
            $ \case
  ```

  Likewise it will give you tips on what to do if you forget a `TypeApplication`
  or forget to handle an effect.

  Don't like helpful errors? That's OK too --- just flip the `error-messages` flag
  and enjoy the raw, unadulterated fury of the typesystem.


  ## Necessary Language Extensions

  You're going to want to stick all of this into your `package.yaml` file.

  ```yaml
    ghc-options: -O2 -flate-specialise -fspecialise-aggressively
    default-extensions:
      - DataKinds
      - FlexibleContexts
      - GADTs
