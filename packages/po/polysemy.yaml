  ## Overview

  `polysemy` is a library for writing high-power, low-boilerplate domain specific
  languages. It allows you to separate your business logic from your
  implementation details. And in doing so, `polysemy` lets you turn your
  implementation code into reusable library code.

  It's like `mtl` but composes better, requires less boilerplate, and avoids the
  O(n^2) instances problem.

  It's like `freer-simple` but more powerful.

  It's like `fused-effects` but with an order of magnitude less boilerplate.

  Additionally, unlike `mtl`, `polysemy` has no functional dependencies, so you
  can use multiple copies of the same effect. This alleviates the need for ~~ugly
  hacks~~ band-aids like
  [classy lenses](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-4.17.1/docs/Control-Lens-TH.html#v:makeClassy),
  the
  [`ReaderT` pattern](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2017/06/readert-design-pattern)
  and nicely solves the
  [trouble with typed errors](https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2018/11/03/trouble_with_typed_errors.html).

  Concerned about type inference? `polysemy` comes with its companion
  [`polysemy-plugin`](https://github.com/isovector/polysemy/tree/master/polysemy-plugin),
  which helps it perform just as well as `mtl`'s! Add `polysemy-plugin` to your
  `package.yaml` or `.cabal` file's `dependencies` section to use. Then turn it on with a pragma in your source files:

  ```haskell
  {-# OPTIONS_GHC -fplugin=Polysemy.Plugin #-}
  ```

  Or by adding `-fplugin=Polysemy.Plugin` to your `package.yaml`/`.cabal` file `ghc-options` section.

  ## Features

  - *Effects are higher-order,* meaning it's trivial to write `bracket` and `local`
      as first-class effects.
  - *Effects are low-boilerplate,* meaning you can create new effects in a
      single-digit number of lines. New interpreters are nothing but functions and
      pattern matching.

  ## Tutorials and Resources

  - Raghu Kaippully wrote a beginner friendly
    [tutorial](https://haskell-explained.gitlab.io/blog/posts/2019/07/28/polysemy-is-cool-part-1/index.html).
  - Paweł Szulc gave a [great talk](https://youtu.be/idU7GdlfP9Q?t=1394) on how
    to start thinking about polysemy.
  - Sandy Maguire, the author, gave a talk on some of the
    [performance implementation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dHFOjcK6pA)
  - He has also written
    [some](http://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/freer-higher-order-effects/)
    [blog posts](http://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/tactics/) on other
    implementation details.

  ## Examples

  Make sure you read the
  [Necessary Language Extensions](https://github.com/polysemy-research/polysemy#necessary-language-extensions)
  before trying these yourself!

  Teletype effect:

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell, LambdaCase, BlockArguments, GADTs
             , FlexibleContexts, TypeOperators, DataKinds, PolyKinds #-}

  import Polysemy
  import Polysemy.Input
  import Polysemy.Output

  data Teletype m a where
    ReadTTY  :: Teletype m String
    WriteTTY :: String -> Teletype m ()

  makeSem ''Teletype

  teletypeToIO :: Member (Embed IO) r => Sem (Teletype ': r) a -> Sem r a
  teletypeToIO = interpret \case
    ReadTTY      -> embed getLine
    WriteTTY msg -> embed $ putStrLn msg

  runTeletypePure :: [String] -> Sem (Teletype ': r) a -> Sem r ([String], a)
  runTeletypePure i
    -- For each WriteTTY in our program, consume an output by appending it to the
    -- list in a ([String], a)
    = runOutputMonoid pure
    -- Treat each element of our list of strings as a line of input
    . runInputList i
    -- Reinterpret our effect in terms of Input and Output
    . reinterpret2 \case
        ReadTTY -> maybe "" id <$> input
        WriteTTY msg -> output msg


  echo :: Member Teletype r => Sem r ()
  echo = do
    i <- readTTY
    case i of
      "" -> pure ()
      _  -> writeTTY i >> echo


  -- Let's pretend
  echoPure :: [String] -> Sem '[] ([String], ())
  echoPure = flip runTeletypePure echo

  pureOutput :: [String] -> [String]
  pureOutput = fst . run . echoPure

  -- echo forever
  main :: IO ()
  main = runM . teletypeToIO $ echo
  ```

  Resource effect:

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell, LambdaCase, BlockArguments, GADTs
             , FlexibleContexts, TypeOperators, DataKinds, PolyKinds
             , TypeApplications #-}

  import Polysemy
  import Polysemy.Input
  import Polysemy.Output
  import Polysemy.Error
  import Polysemy.Resource

  -- Using Teletype effect from above

  data CustomException = ThisException | ThatException deriving Show

  program :: Members '[Resource, Teletype, Error CustomException] r => Sem r ()
  program = catch @CustomException work \e -> writeTTY $ "Caught " ++ show e
   where
    work = bracket (readTTY) (const $ writeTTY "exiting bracket") \input -> do
      writeTTY "entering bracket"
      case input of
        "explode"     -> throw ThisException
        "weird stuff" -> writeTTY input *> throw ThatException
        _             -> writeTTY input *> writeTTY "no exceptions"

  main :: IO (Either CustomException ())
  main
    = runFinal
    . embedToFinal @IO
    . resourceToIOFinal
    . errorToIOFinal @CustomException
    . teletypeToIO
    $ program
  ```

  Easy.

  ## Friendly Error Messages

  Free monad libraries aren't well known for their ease-of-use. But following in
  the shoes of `freer-simple`, `polysemy` takes a serious stance on providing
  helpful error messages.

  For example, the library exposes both the `interpret` and `interpretH`
  combinators. If you use the wrong one, the library's got your back:

  ```haskell
  runResource
      :: forall r a
       . Sem (Resource ': r) a
      -> Sem r a
  runResource = interpret $ \case
    ...
  ```

  makes the helpful suggestion:

  ```txt
  • 'Resource' is higher-order, but 'interpret' can help only
    with first-order effects.
    Fix:
      use 'interpretH' instead.
  • In the expression:
      interpret
        $ \case
  ```

  Likewise it will give you tips on what to do if you forget a `TypeApplication`
  or forget to handle an effect.

  Don't like helpful errors? That's OK too - just flip the `error-messages`
  flag and enjoy the raw, unadulterated fury of the typesystem.

  ## Necessary Language Extensions

  You're going to want to stick all of this into your `package.yaml` file.

  ```yaml
    ghc-options: -O2 -flate-specialise -fspecialise-aggressively
    default-extensions:
      - DataKinds
      - FlexibleContexts
      - GADTs
      - LambdaCase

  ## Building with Nix

  The project provides a basic nix config for building in development.
  It is defined as a [flake] with backwards compatibility stubs in `default.nix` and `shell.nix`.

  To build the main library or plugin:

  ```bash
  nix-build -A polysemy
  nix-build -A polysemy-plugin
  ```

  Flake version:

  ```bash
  nix build
  nix build '.#polysemy-plugin'
  ```

  To inspect a dependency:

  ```bash
  nix repl

  > p = import ./.
  > p.unagi-chan
  ```

  To run a shell command with all dependencies in the environment:

  ```bash
  nix-shell --pure
  nix-shell --pure --run 'cabal v2-haddock polysemy'
  nix-shell --pure --run ghcid
  ```

  Flake version:

  ```bash
  nix develop -i # just enter a shell
  nix develop -i -c cabal v2-haddock polysemy
  nix develop -i -c haskell-language-server-wrapper # start HLS for your IDE
  ```

  ## *What about performance?* ([TL;DR](#tldr))

  Previous versions of this `README` mentioned **the library being**
  ***zero-cost***, as in having no visible effect on performance. While this was
  the original motivation and main factor in implementation of this library, it
  turned out that
  [**optimizations** we depend on](https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/specialization/),
  while showing amazing results in small benchmarks, **don't work in
  [bigger, multi-module programs](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/313#issuecomment-590143835)**,
  what greatly limits their usefulness.

  What's more interesting though is that
  this **isn't a `polysemy`-specific** problem - basically **all popular effects
  libraries** ended up being bitten by variation of this problem in one way or
  another, resulting in
  [visible drop in performance](https://github.com/lexi-lambda/ghc-proposals/blob/delimited-continuation-primops/proposals/0000-delimited-continuation-primops.md#putting-numbers-to-the-cost)
  compared to equivalent code without use of effect systems.

  *Why did nobody notice this?*

  One factor may be that while GHC's optimizer is
  very, very good in general in optimizing all sorts of abstraction, it's
  relatively complex and hard to predict - authors of libraries may have not
  deemed location of code relevant, even though it had big effect at the end.
  The other is that maybe **it doesn't matter as much** as we like to tell
  ourselves. Many of these effects
  libraries are used in production and they're doing just fine, because maximum
  performance usually matters in small, controlled areas of code, that often
  don't use features of effect systems at all.

  *What can we do about this?*

  Luckily, the same person that uncovered this problems proposed a
  [solution](https://github.com/lexi-lambda/ghc-proposals/blob/delimited-continuation-primops/proposals/0000-delimited-continuation-primops.md) -
  set of primops that will allow interpretation of effects at runtime, with
  minimal overhead. It's not *zero-cost* as we hoped for with `polysemy` at
  first, but it should have negligible effect on performance in real life and
  compared to current solutions, it should be much more predictable and even
  resolve some problems with behaviour of
  [specific effects](https://github.com/polysemy-research/polysemy/issues/246).
  You can try out experimental library that uses proposed features
  [here](https://github.com/hasura/eff).

  When it comes to `polysemy`, once GHC proposal lands, we will consider the option of
  switching to an implementation based on it. This will probably require some
  breaking changes, but should resolve performance issues and maybe even make
  implementation of higher-order effects easier.

  If you're interested in more details, see
  Alexis King's
  [talk about the problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jI-AlWEwYI),
  Sandy Maguire's
  [followup about how it relates to `polysemy`](https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/mea-culpa/) and
  [GHC proposal](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/313) that
  adds features needed for new type of implementation.

  ### TL;DR

  Basically all current effects libraries (including `polysemy` and
  even `mtl`) got performance wrong - **but**, there's ongoing work on extending
  GHC with features that will allow for creation of effects implementation with
  stable and strong performance. It's what `polysemy` may choose at some point,
  but it will probably require few breaking changes.
