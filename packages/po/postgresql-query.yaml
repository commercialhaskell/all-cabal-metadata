  # What ?

  `postgresql-query` is a library for more simple query generation for
  PostgreSQL database. It is not an ORM (but contains some part of). It
  contains interpolating quasiquote for simple query generation.

  # Motivation

  When you want to perform some complex SQL query using
  `postgresql-simple` you writing this query by hands like that:

  ```haskell
  let q = mconcat
          [ "SELECT u.id, u.name, count(p.id) "
          , "FROM users as u INNER JOIN posts as p "
          , "ON u.id = p.user_id "
          , "WHERE u.name like ? AND u.created BETWEEN ? AND ? "
          , "GROUP BY u.id ORDER BY ? " ]
  ```

  Well, this is not realy complex. Now what you need to perform the
  query is to paste parameters instead of this `?` signs:

  ```haskell
  query con q ("%Peyton%", now, yesterday)
  ```

  Did you see the mistake? We forgot about ordering field. To perform this query we must

  ```haskell
  query con q ("%Peyton%", now, yesterday, Identifier "...
  ```

  Oups!. If we use `Identifier "u.name"` we will get `"u.name"` in our
  query which is just not right. Sql syntax assumes `"u"."name"` for
  this query. We can not use query parameter to paste optional field
  here.


  Next example is more complex:

  ```haskell
  let name = Just "%Peyton%" -- assume we getting parameters from query
      minage = Just 10
      maxage = Just 50
      condlist = catMaybes
                 [ const " u.name like ? " <$> name
                 , const " u.age > ? " <$> minage
                 , const " u.age < ? " <$> maxage ]
      paramlist = catMaybes
                  [ toField <$> name
                  , toField <$> minage
                  , toField <$> maxage ]
      cond = if L.null condlist
             then mempty
             else "WHERE " <> (mconcat $ L.intersperse " AND " condlist)
      q = "SELECT u.id, u.name, u.age FROM users AS u " <> cond
  query con q paramlist
  ```

  So much to write and so many chances to make a mistake. What if we
  could write this like:

  ```haskell
  let name = Just "%Peyton%" -- assume we getting parameters from query
      minage = Just 10
      maxage = Just 50
      ord = "u.name" :: FN -- <- special type for field names!
      condlist = catMaybes
                 [ (\a -> [sqlExp|u.name like #{a}|]) <$> name
                 , (\a -> [sqlExp|u.age > #{a}|])     <$> minage
                 , (\a -> [sqlExp|u.age < #{a}|])     <$> maxage ]
      cond = if L.null condlist
             then mempty
             else [sqlExp|WHERE ^{mconcat $ L.intersperse " AND " condlist}|]
  pqQuery [sqlExp|SELECT u.id, u.name, u.age
                  FROM users AS u ^{cond}
                  ORDER BY ^{ord}|]
  ```

  Much better!

  # sqlExp

  Quasiquote `sqlExp` has two way of interpolation:

  * `#{exp}` - pastes inside query arbitrary value which type is
    instance of `ToField` typeclass. It performs correct strings
    escaping so it is not the same as stupid string interpolation. Dont
    worry about sql-injections when using it.

  * `^{exp}` - pastes inside query arbitrary value which type has
    instance of `ToSqlBuilder` typeclass.

  `sqlExp` returns `SqlBuilder` which has a `Monoid` instance
  and made for effective concatination (bytestring builder works
  inside).

  This quasiquote correctly handles string literals and quoted
  identifiers. It also removes line and block (even nested) sql comments
  from resulting query as well as sequences of space characters. You are
  free to write queries like

  ```sql
  WHERE name SIMILAR TO '\^{2,3}' -- line comment #{ololo}
  ```

  or even

  ```sql
  WHERE "#{strange}identifier" SIMILAR TO '#{1,10}' /*nested/*^{block}*/comment*/
  ```

  `sqlExp` will remove all comments and will not interpolate inside
  string literals or quoted identifiers at all.

  ## sqlExpEmbed and sqlExpFile

  If you have realy huge hardcore sql template you can

  ```haskell
  pgQuery $(sqlExpEmbed "sql/foo/bar.sql")
  ```

  It works just like Yesod's templates. You can use interpolation inside
  templates like inside `sqlExp`.

  ```haskell
  pgQuery $(sqlExpFile "foo/bar")
  ```

  Is absolutely the same as above. It just prepends `sql/` and
  appends `.sql` to your string. If you agree to follow naming
  conventions you are welcome to use `sqlExpFile`.
