description: |-
  Yampa-based, domain-specific language embedded in Haskell for programming
  robots. At present, only simulated robots. However, the infrastructure is
  separated into generic and robot-specific parts, and set up so as to make
  it possible to write robot code that depends only on specific features, as
  opposed to specific platforms or versions of those platforms. Thus, it is
  in principle possible to write quite generic robot code. (Once upon a time,
  the Pioneer platform, a real robot, was supported.)
