  # 0.3

  - Extracted the `Is` and `IsSome` typeclasses into a separate library ["lawful-conversions"](https://github.com/nikita-volkov/lawful-conversions)
  - Restored the `IsomorphicTo` typeclass from the `0.1` design without restoring the `String` instance and the `showAs` utility

  # 0.2

  - `IsomorphicTo` renamed to `Is`
  - `IsSome` is introduced as a parent class to it
  - `to` moved to `IsSome`
  - `showAs` dropped
  - `String` isomorphism instances for textual types dropped, since they were not exactly isomorphisms
  - `IsSome` instances added for `String` for textual types

  = Conversion problem

  How often do you import @Data.Text.Lazy@ only to call @fromStrict@ or @toStrict@?
  How about importing @Data.ByteString.Builder@ only to call its
  @toLazyByteString@ and then importing
  @Data.ByteString.Lazy@ only to call its @toStrict@?
  How often do you convert from @DiffTime@ to @NominalDiffTime@ or back?

  These are all instances of one pattern. They are conversions between different
  representations of the same information. Codebases that don't attempt to
  abstract over this pattern tend to be sprawling with this type of
  boilerplate. It's noise to the code reader, it's a burden to implementors
  and maintainers.

  = Why another conversion library?

  Many libraries exist that approach the conversion problem. However, most of
  them provide lawless typeclasses, leaving it up to the author of the
  instance to define what makes a proper conversion. This results in
  inconsistencies across instances, their behavior not being evident to
  the user and no way to check whether an instance is correct.

  This library tackles this problem with a lawful typeclass, making it
  evident what any of its instances do, and it provides a property-test for you
  to validate your instances.

  = The insight

  The key insight of this library is that if you add a requirement for the
  conversion to be lossless and to have a mirror conversion in the opposite
  direction, there usually appears to be only one way of defining it. That
  makes it very clear what the conversion does to the user and how to define
  it for the author of the conversion.
  It also gives clear criteria for validating whether the instances are correct, which can be encoded in property-tests.

  That insight itself stems from an observation that almost all of the
  practical conversions in Haskell share a property: you can restore the
  original data from its converted form. E.g., you can get a text from
  a text-builder and you can create a text-builder from a text, you can convert
  a bytestring into a list of bytes and vice-versa, bytestring to\/from bytearray,
  strict bytestring to\/from lazy, list to\/from sequence, sequence to/from
  vector, set of ints to\/from int-set. In other words, it's always a two-way
  street with them and there are many instances of this pattern.

  A few other accidental findings like encoding this property with recursive
  typeclass constraints and fine-tuning for the use of
  the @TypeApplications@ extension resulted in a terse and clear API.

  = Other work and acknowledgements

  - [lawful-conversions](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lawful-conversions) - sibling of this library expanding upon the same insights to also cover the patterns of smart construction and canonicalization. It's more involved and has different tradeoffs. Both libraries are maintained, letting their designs compete.

  Some ideas and concepts are also shared with the following libraries:

  - [control-iso](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/control-iso)
  - [type-iso](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/type-iso)
  - [injections](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/injections)
