  # Changelog

  `jira-wiki-markup` uses [PVP Versioning][1].
  The changelog is available [on GitHub][2].

  1.1.2
  =====

  Released 2020-03-18

  * Don't escape colon/semicolon unless necessary: it is necessary
    to escape colons or semicolons only if they could otherwise
    become part of a smiley.

  1.1.1
  =====

  Released 2020-03-18

  * Colon `:` and semicolon `;` are now parsed as special
    characters, since they can be the first characters of an emoji.
  * Fixed parsing of words which contain non-special symbol
    characters: word boundaries were not set correctly if a word
    contained a dot `.` or similar chars.
  * Fixed incorrect emphasis parsing: digits were erroneously
    allows as the first characters after closing emphasis
    characters.

  1.1.0
  =====

  Released 2020-03-13.

  * Lists are now allowed to be indented; i.e., lists are still recognized
    if list markers are preceded by spaces.
  * Support for colored inlines has been added.
  * New constructor `ColorInline` for type `Inline` (API change).

  1.0.0
  =====

  Released 2019-12-17.

  * Add `Doc` datatype representing a full document; `parse` now returns
    this type.
  * Improve parsing:
    - double-backslash is recognized as linebreak;
    - emoticons are parsed as `Emoji`;
    - special sequences of dashes are translated into their unicode
      representation;
    - naked URLs are parsed as `AutoLink`;
    - blocks of colored text are parsed as `Color`;
    - interpretation of special characters as markup can be forced by
      surrounding them with curly braces.
  * A parser `plainText` was made available to read markup-less text.
  * *Inline*-parser `symbol` was renamed to `specialChar`.
  * Add printer module to render the document AST as Jira markup.
  * Markup datatype changes:
    - new *Block* elements `Color` and `HorizontalRule`.
    - new *Inline* elements `Emoji`, and `Styled`.
    - *Inline* constructors `Subscript`, `Superscript`, `Emph`, `Strong`,
      `Inserted`, and `Deleted` have been remove. Use `Styled` instead.
    - Constructor `Image` now takes a list of parameters as an additional
      argument.
  * CI runs also test GHC 8.8.

  0.1.1
  =====

  * Ensure proper parsing of backslash-escaped characters.

  0.1.0
  =====

  * Initially created.

  This package provides a parser and printer for [Jira wiki markup]. It
  converts the raw text into an abstract syntax tree. The tree is easy to
  handle and to translate into different output formats.
