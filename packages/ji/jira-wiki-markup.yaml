synopsis: Handle Jira wiki markup
changelog: "Changelog\n=========\n\n`jira-wiki-markup` uses [PVP Versioning][1].\nThe
  changelog is available [on GitHub][2].\n\n1.4.0\n-----\n\nReleased 2021-05-25.\n\n*
  Allow quoted image parameters.\n\n* Added support for \"smart links\".\n\n* **API
  Change**: Add new constructors `SmartCard` and `SmartLink` to\n  Text.Jira.Markup.LinkType.\n\n1.3.5\n-----\n\nReleased
  2021-05-24.\n\n\n* Allow spaces and most unicode characters in attachment links.\n\n*
  No longer require a newline character after `{noformat}`.\n\n* Only allow URI path
  segment characters in bare links.\n\n* The `file:` schema is no longer allowed in
  bare links; these\n  rarely make sense.\n\n1.3.4\n-----\n\nReleased 2021-03-13.\n\n*
  Fixed parsing of autolinks (i.e., of bare URLs in the text).\n  Previously an autolink
  would take up the rest of a line, as\n  spaces were allowed characters in these
  items.\n  \n* Emoji character sequences no longer cause parsing failures. This\n
  \ was due to missing backtracking when emoji parsing fails.\n  \n* Block quotes
  are only rendered as `bq.` if they do not contain a\n  linebreak.\n\n1.3.3\n-----\n\nReleased
  2021-02-12.\n\n* Modified the Doc parser to skip leading blank lines. This fixes\n
  \ parsing of documents which start with multiple blank lines.\n\n* Prevent URLs
  within link aliases to be treated as autolinks.\n\n1.3.2\n-----\n\nReleased 2020-06-22.\n\n*
  Braces are now always escaped when printing; Jira treats braces\n  specially, regardless
  of context.\n\n1.3.1\n-----\n\nReleased 2020-06-14\n\n* Added support for links
  to anchors.\n\n* Styled text may not wrap across multiple lines; linebreaks in\n
  \ marked-up text are now forbidden.\n\n* Module Text.Jira.Parser.Core: new function
  `many1Till` which\n  behaves like `manyTill`, but requires at least on element to
  be\n  parsed.\n\n* Ensured the package works with GHC 8.10.\n\n1.3.0\n-----\n\nReleased
  2020-04-04\n\n* Support was added for additional syntax constructs:\n\n    - citation
  markup (`??citation??`),\n    - links to attachments (`[title^attachment.ext]`),
  and\n    - user links (`[~username]`).\n\n* Changes to module `Text.Jira.Markup`:\n\n
  \   * A new data type `LinkType` is exported from the module.\n\n    * Changes to
  type `Inline`:\n\n        - a new constructor `Citation` has been added;\n        -
  the `Link` constructor now takes an additional\n          parameter of type `LinkType`.\n\n1.2.1\n-----\n\nReleased
  2020-04-02\n\n* Fixed rendering of image attributes: image attributes are\n  separated
  by commas instead of pipes; the latter are used in\n  block parameters.\n\n* Fixed
  parsing of blockquotes which are not preceeded by blank\n  lines.\n\n* Ensure parsing
  of single-line blockquotes is possible even if\n  there is no space between `bq.`
  marker and contents.\n\n* Fixed parsing of colors: parsing no longer fails for hexcolors\n
  \ which contain non-decimal digits.\n\n* Changes to module `Text.Jira.Parser.Shared`:\n\n
  \   - New parsing function `colorName` which parses a color\n      descriptor, i.e.
  either a name or a hexcolor.\n\n1.2.0\n-----\n\nReleased 2020-03-28\n\n* Added check
  that a closing markup char is not preceeded by a\n  whitespace character. Previously,
  plain text was still\n  incorrectly treated as markup. E.g., the dashes in `-> step
  ->`\n  used to be interpreted as delimiters marking deleted text.\n\n* Allows empty
  table cells; table parsing failed if one of the\n  cells did not contain any content.\n\n*
  Changes to module `Text.Jira.Parser.Core`:\n\n    - A field `stateLastSpcPos` was
  added to data type\n      `ParserState` to keep track of spaces.\n    - Function
  `updateLastSpcPos` was added to update the\n      aforementioned field.\n    - Function
  `afterSpace` was added to test the field.\n\n1.1.4\n-----\n\nReleased 2020-03-27\n\n*
  Fixed parsing of image parameters. Thumbnails and images with\n  parameters were
  previously not recognized as images.\n\n1.1.3\n-----\n\nReleased 2020-03-19\n\n*
  Fixed table detection in endOfParagraph parser: Tables were\n  expected to have
  a space between the leading pipe(s) and the\n  cell content. Lines like `||Name|`
  were erroneously not\n  recognized as the beginning of a new block.\n\n1.1.2\n-----\n\nReleased
  2020-03-18\n\n* Don't escape colon/semicolon unless necessary: it is necessary\n
  \ to escape colons or semicolons only if they could otherwise\n  become part of
  a smiley.\n\n1.1.1\n-----\n\nReleased 2020-03-18\n\n* Colon `:` and semicolon `;`
  are now parsed as special\n  characters, since they can be the first characters
  of an emoji.\n* Fixed parsing of words which contain non-special symbol\n  characters:
  word boundaries were not set correctly if a word\n  contained a dot `.` or similar
  chars.\n* Fixed incorrect emphasis parsing: digits were erroneously\n  allows as
  the first characters after closing emphasis\n  characters.\n\n1.1.0\n-----\n\nReleased
  2020-03-13.\n\n* Lists are now allowed to be indented; i.e., lists are still recognized\n
  \ if list markers are preceded by spaces.\n* Support for colored inlines has been
  added.\n* New constructor `ColorInline` for type `Inline` (API change).\n\n1.0.0\n-----\n\nReleased
  2019-12-17.\n\n* Add `Doc` datatype representing a full document; `parse` now returns\n
  \ this type.\n* Improve parsing:\n  - double-backslash is recognized as linebreak;\n
  \ - emoticons are parsed as `Emoji`;\n  - special sequences of dashes are translated
  into their unicode\n    representation;\n  - naked URLs are parsed as `AutoLink`;\n
  \ - blocks of colored text are parsed as `Color`;\n  - interpretation of special
  characters as markup can be forced by\n    surrounding them with curly braces.\n*
  A parser `plainText` was made available to read markup-less text.\n* *Inline*-parser
  `symbol` was renamed to `specialChar`.\n* Add printer module to render the document
  AST as Jira markup.\n* Markup datatype changes:\n  - new *Block* elements `Color`
  and `HorizontalRule`.\n  - new *Inline* elements `Emoji`, and `Styled`.\n  - *Inline*
  constructors `Subscript`, `Superscript`, `Emph`, `Strong`,\n    `Inserted`, and
  `Deleted` have been remove. Use `Styled` instead.\n  - Constructor `Image` now takes
  a list of parameters as an additional\n    argument.\n* CI runs also test GHC 8.8.\n\n0.1.1\n-----\n\n*
  Ensure proper parsing of backslash-escaped characters.\n\n0.1.0\n-----\n\n* Initially
  created.\n\n[1]: https://pvp.haskell.org\n[2]: https://github.com/tarleb/jira-wiki-markup/releases\n"

  This package provides a parser and printer for [Jira wiki markup]. It
  converts the raw text into an abstract syntax tree. The tree is easy to
  handle and to translate into different output formats.
