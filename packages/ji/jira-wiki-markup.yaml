  Changelog
  =========

  `jira-wiki-markup` uses [PVP Versioning][1].
  The changelog is available [on GitHub][2].

  1.3.3
  -----

  Released 2021-02-12.

  * Modified the Doc parser to skip leading blank lines. This fixes
    parsing of documents which start with multiple blank lines.

  * Prevent URLs within link aliases to be treated as autolinks.

  1.3.2
  -----

  Released 2020-06-22.

  * Braces are now always escaped when printing; Jira treats braces
    specially, regardless of context.

  1.3.1
  -----

  Released 2020-06-14

  * Added support for links to anchors.

  * Styled text may not wrap across multiple lines; linebreaks in
    marked-up text are now forbidden.

  * Module Text.Jira.Parser.Core: new function `many1Till` which
    behaves like `manyTill`, but requires at least on element to be
    parsed.

  * Ensured the package works with GHC 8.10.

  1.3.0
  -----

  Released 2020-04-04

  * Support was added for additional syntax constructs:

      - citation markup (`??citation??`),
      - links to attachments (`[title^attachment.ext]`), and
      - user links (`[~username]`).

  * Changes to module `Text.Jira.Markup`:

      * A new data type `LinkType` is exported from the module.

      * Changes to type `Inline`:

          - a new constructor `Citation` has been added;
          - the `Link` constructor now takes an additional
            parameter of type `LinkType`.

  1.2.1
  -----

  Released 2020-04-02

  * Fixed rendering of image attributes: image attributes are
    separated by commas instead of pipes; the latter are used in
    block parameters.

  * Fixed parsing of blockquotes which are not preceeded by blank
    lines.

  * Ensure parsing of single-line blockquotes is possible even if
    there is no space between `bq.` marker and contents.

  * Fixed parsing of colors: parsing no longer fails for hexcolors
    which contain non-decimal digits.

  * Changes to module `Text.Jira.Parser.Shared`:

      - New parsing function `colorName` which parses a color
        descriptor, i.e. either a name or a hexcolor.

  1.2.0
  -----

  Released 2020-03-28

  * Added check that a closing markup char is not preceeded by a
    whitespace character. Previously, plain text was still
    incorrectly treated as markup. E.g., the dashes in `-> step ->`
    used to be interpreted as delimiters marking deleted text.

  * Allows empty table cells; table parsing failed if one of the
    cells did not contain any content.

  * Changes to module `Text.Jira.Parser.Core`:

      - A field `stateLastSpcPos` was added to data type
        `ParserState` to keep track of spaces.
      - Function `updateLastSpcPos` was added to update the
        aforementioned field.
      - Function `afterSpace` was added to test the field.

  1.1.4
  -----

  Released 2020-03-27

  * Fixed parsing of image parameters. Thumbnails and images with
    parameters were previously not recognized as images.

  1.1.3
  -----

  Released 2020-03-19

  * Fixed table detection in endOfParagraph parser: Tables were
    expected to have a space between the leading pipe(s) and the
    cell content. Lines like `||Name|` were erroneously not
    recognized as the beginning of a new block.

  1.1.2
  -----

  Released 2020-03-18

  * Don't escape colon/semicolon unless necessary: it is necessary
    to escape colons or semicolons only if they could otherwise
    become part of a smiley.

  1.1.1
  -----

  Released 2020-03-18

  * Colon `:` and semicolon `;` are now parsed as special
    characters, since they can be the first characters of an emoji.
  * Fixed parsing of words which contain non-special symbol
    characters: word boundaries were not set correctly if a word
    contained a dot `.` or similar chars.
  * Fixed incorrect emphasis parsing: digits were erroneously
    allows as the first characters after closing emphasis
    characters.

  1.1.0
  -----

  Released 2020-03-13.

  * Lists are now allowed to be indented; i.e., lists are still recognized
    if list markers are preceded by spaces.
  * Support for colored inlines has been added.
  * New constructor `ColorInline` for type `Inline` (API change).

  1.0.0
  -----

  Released 2019-12-17.

  * Add `Doc` datatype representing a full document; `parse` now returns
    this type.
  * Improve parsing:
    - double-backslash is recognized as linebreak;
    - emoticons are parsed as `Emoji`;
    - special sequences of dashes are translated into their unicode
      representation;
    - naked URLs are parsed as `AutoLink`;
    - blocks of colored text are parsed as `Color`;
    - interpretation of special characters as markup can be forced by
      surrounding them with curly braces.
  * A parser `plainText` was made available to read markup-less text.
  * *Inline*-parser `symbol` was renamed to `specialChar`.
  * Add printer module to render the document AST as Jira markup.
  * Markup datatype changes:
    - new *Block* elements `Color` and `HorizontalRule`.
    - new *Inline* elements `Emoji`, and `Styled`.
    - *Inline* constructors `Subscript`, `Superscript`, `Emph`, `Strong`,
      `Inserted`, and `Deleted` have been remove. Use `Styled` instead.
    - Constructor `Image` now takes a list of parameters as an additional
      argument.
  * CI runs also test GHC 8.8.

  0.1.1
  -----

  * Ensure proper parsing of backslash-escaped characters.

  0.1.0
  -----

  * Initially created.
