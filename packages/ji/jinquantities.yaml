description: ! 'A library for creating and manipulating physical

  quantities, which are a numerical value

  associated with a unit of measurement.

  Credit goes to https://github.com/jdreaver/quantities

  from which this package is initially a fork. Included

  is an expression parser and a huge list of

  predefined quantities with which to parse

  strings into a Quantity datatype. Once created,

  a quantity can be converted to different units

  or queried for its dimensionality. A user can

  also operate on quantities arithmetically, and

  doing so uses automatic unit conversion and

  simplification.'
