  ## 0.1.0 (2018-09-07)
  - Fork from https://github.com/jdreaver/quantities
changelog-type: markdown
description: |-
  A library for creating and manipulating physical
  quantities, which are a numerical value
  associated with a unit of measurement.
  Credit goes to https://github.com/jdreaver/quantities
  from which this package is initially a fork. Included
  is an expression parser and a huge list of
  predefined quantities with which to parse
  strings into a Quantity datatype. Once created,
  a quantity can be converted to different units
  or queried for its dimensionality. A user can
  also operate on quantities arithmetically, and
  doing so uses automatic unit conversion and
  simplification.
