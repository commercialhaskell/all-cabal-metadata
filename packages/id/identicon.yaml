synopsis: Flexible generation of identicons
changelog: ! "## Identicon 0.2.1\n\n* Added `Semigroup` and `Monoid` instances for
  `Layer`.\n\n## Identicon 0.2.0\n\n* Added benchmarks.\n\n* Renamed `applyWords`
  to `applyBytes` (method of type class `ApplyBytes`).\n  It's unlikely that anyone
  uses it though as it's more of internal\n  machinery.\n\n## Identicon 0.1.0\n\n*
  Initial release.\n"

  Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/mrkkrp/identicon/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/mrkkrp/identicon?branch=master)\n\nThe
  package implements flexible generation of identicons using the\n[Juicy Pixels](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/JuicyPixels)
  package.\nIt's reasonably fast for my taste, and since identicons are usually not\nbigger
  than 420 × 420 pixels, I think that sequential generation that\nJuicyPixels supports
  fits the task very well.\n\n## Quick start\n\nTo use the package you usually need
  the following set of imports (and a\ncouple of language extensions for type level
  magic):\n\n```haskell\n{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds     #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators
  #-}\n\nimport Codec.Picture -- JuicyPixels\nimport Data.ByteString (ByteString)
  -- we use strict byte strings\nimport Data.Proxy\nimport Data.Word (Word8)\nimport
  Graphics.Identicon -- core definitions\nimport Graphics.Identicon.Primitive -- some
  visual primitives\n```\n\nYou first write a type that has information about total
  number of bytes your\nidenticon consumes and number of distinct visual components
  it has (it's\ncalled “layers” in terminology of the package):\n\n```haskell\ntype
  MyIcon = Identicon 12 :+ Consumer 4 :+ Consumer 4 :+ Consumer 4\n```\n\nHere we
  have an identicon that needs 12 bytes to be generated. It has three\nconsumers that
  take 4 bytes each and generate layers, i.e. visual objects\n(circles, squares, etc.).\n\nThe
  second step is to write implementation of every layer. We can use\nprimitives available
  out-of-box, they live in the\n`Graphics.Identicon.Primitive` module:\n\n```haskell\nmyImpl
  :: Implementation MyIcon\nmyImpl = Identicon :+ a :+ a :+ a\n  where\n    a :: Word8
  -> Word8 -> Word8 -> Word8 -> Layer\n    a r g b n = rsym $ onGrid 3 3 n $\n      gradientXY
  (edge . mid) black (PixelRGB8 r g b)\n```\n\nWe could choose to code every layer
  differently, but since position and\ncolor of every layer are unlikely to be the
  same, this approach will work\nwell too.\n\nEvery byte is available to layer-generating
  function as a distinct `Word8`\nargument. The type system makes sure that:\n\n*
  you consume exactly as many bytes as you promised in type of your\n  identicon;\n\n*
  you have as many layers as you described in type of your identicon;\n\n* every function
  in your implementation has correct signature (i.e. it grabs\n  as many `Word8`s
  as promised and produces a `Layer` in the end).\n\nMixing of layers and generation
  is handled by the library like this:\n\n```haskell\n-- | Here is the function that
  generates your identicons. It's usually\n-- convenient to wrap the 'renderIdenticon'
  function that comes with the\n-- library.\n\ngenMyIdenticon\n  :: Int               --
  ^ Identicon width\n  -> Int               -- ^ Identicon height\n  -> ByteString
  \       -- ^ Input (some sort of hash or something)\n  -> Maybe (Image PixelRGB8)\n
  \    -- ^ Identicon, unless 'ByteString' is too short\ngenMyIdenticon = renderIdenticon
  (Proxy :: Proxy MyIcon) myImpl\n```\n\nFor more information head straight to Haddocks.
  BTW, I have written\n[a blog post](https://mrkkrp.github.io/posts/the-identicon-package.html)\nabout
  the package where I demonstrate some pictures generated with it.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright
