description: |-
  Interactive domain reasoner for logic and mathematics, based on the
  feedback services of the Ideas framework. Domains supported include
  propositional logic (disjunctive normal form and equivalence proofs),
  mathematics (fractions, polynomial equations, powers, derivatives),
  linear algebra (Gaussian elimination and linear systems), and relation
  algebra. The domain reasoner is used by learning environments such as
  the digital mathematical environment of the Freudenthal Institute, MathDox,
  ActiveMath, and the LogEx logic tool.
