description: |
  The goal of this Haskell library is to support conversions of
  (internationalized) domain names between the ASCII (ACE) and Unicode encodings
  in accordance with IDNA2008 (RFC 5991: Internationalized Domain Names in
  Applications (IDNA): Protocol).

  The current version, 0.0.1.0, supports encoding a Unicode hostname to an ASCII
  hostname. Note however that the code is currently prototyped and untested.

  A later version will add validation support.
