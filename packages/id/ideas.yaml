synopsis: Feedback services for intelligent tutoring systems
changelog: "Changelog ideas-1.7 => ideas-1.8\n\n* support for automatically generated
  (generic) IsTerm instances\n* introducing Examples data type for exercise records
  (unifying expr lists/generators)\n* redesigning xml interface (with proper character
  escaping)\n* adding literal xml to service types\n* introducing ToXML and ToHTML
  type classes\n* new command-line option for rerunning inputs in database\n* solution
  service variant with parameterized max number of steps\n* adding instance for IsTerm
  (a, b, c)\n* extending derivation interface (in Ideas.Common.Derivation)\n* refactoring
  logging interface and database name\n* new general Decoding module in utils; refactored
  encoders/decoders\n* moving unicode decoding from parseXML/parseJSON to Main.Default\n\nChangelog
  ideas-1.6 => ideas.1.7\n\n* replacing network.cgi package by WAI\n* adding support
  for MathML\n* adding constraints (to exercises) for constraint-based tutoring\n*
  adding support for W3CSS (css classes and templates)\n* restyling html output\n*
  set busy timeout on database connection (when logging requests)\n* changing name
  of logging database for v2 schema, and make v2 the default\n* logging is now by
  default enabled: see 'logging' flag in cabal package\n* improving performance of
  rulesinfo service\n* merging duplicate attributes in xml/html\n* simplifying the
  computation of the difference between terms\n* extending xml-encoder with cases
  for lists, attributes and content data\n* adding missing strategy combinators preference
  and orelse\n* adding instances for type class Different\n* improving Show instance
  for Context\n* show logging enabled/disabled in html output\n\nChangelog ideas-1.5
  => ideas.1.6\n\n* dynamic strategy combinator that uses the current object/term\n*
  more instances for IsTerm (Maybe, Bool, Map, Set)\n* exercise-specific properties
  (that can be parameterized over its type)\n* support for encoding exercise terms
  in JSON (using an exercise property)\n* basic support for Latex and MathJax (in
  html output)\n* extended 'apply' feedback service with buggy rules and restarts\n*
  redesigned (parameterized) transformations\n* reimplemented strategy combinator
  split, based on %>>\n* new function defaultMainWith, which takes options\n* added
  'onefinal' feedback service, which returns a final term in context\n* layered design
  for sub-directories: renaming/moving some modules \n  (e.g. Ideas.Utils.Prelude)\n*
  Typeable constraint now properly encapsulated in Ref type\n* removing (static) documentation
  generation (unused feature)\n* removing Common.Algebra modules (now in the Math
  domain reasoner)\n* fixed escaping of characters in xml\n* fixed recognition of
  exercise IDs in ModeJSON\n* fixed processing of Null in EncoderJSON\n* fixed rule
  ordering in function ruleset\n \nChangelog ideas-1.4 => ideas.1.5\n\n* upgrade to
  ghc-7.10\n* reintroducing dependency on standard cgi library\n* adding missing instances
  for Term and ShowString\n* new option for JSON mode: exercise terms can be encoded
  in JSON\n* switched to QuickCheck's random number generator QCGen\n* requests can
  fix the random seed\n* added Term to service types, encoders and decoders\n* JSON-Int
  can be used for decoded environments\n* new implementation for interleave and atomic
  prefix combinators (more lazy)\n* bug fix: \"no prefix\" now handled by json decoder\n\n\nChangelog
  ideas-1.3.1 => ideas.1.4\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*
  refactoring of strategies\n  - strategies are now represented cyclic trees (that
  preserve fixpoints)\n  - new strategy combinators can be defined outside the framework\n
  \ - simpler interfaces: no more Builder, Step, and Core datatypes\n  - nice speed-up
  for constructing and running strategies\n  \n* support for new database schema (v2)
  with more columns\n  - request can have an optional 'logging' attribute (false,
  v1, v2)\n  - command-line flag for seeing information that is logged \n  - userid,
  sessionid, and taskid are stored in a state\n\n* changing license to Apache License
  version 2.0 (was: GPL)\n* renaming strategy combinators (eg .*.) to solve clash
  with Applicative.<*> \n* adding SyntaxError constructor to Diagnose datatype\n*
  added read instance for Difficulty\n* changed newline and tab escaping in JSON\n*
  re-implemented atomic combinator\n* introduced inits combinator  (initial prefixes)
  and atomic prefix (!~>)\n* introduced somewhereWhen traversal combinator\n* added
  cabal flag to resolve dependency on network >= 2.6\n* added cabal flag to enable
  support for logging"

description: |-
  Ideas (Interactive Domain-specific Exercise Assistants) is a joint research
  project between the Open University of the Netherlands and Utrecht
  University. The project's goal is to use software and compiler technology to
  build state-of-the-art components for intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) and
  learning environments. The 'ideas' software package provides a generic
  framework for constructing the expert knowledge module (also known as a
  domain reasoner) for an ITS or learning environment. Domain knowledge is
  offered as a set of feedback services that are used by external tools such
  as the digital mathematical environment (DME), MathDox, and the Math-Bridge
  system. We have developed several domain reasoners based on this framework,
  including reasoners for mathematics, linear algebra, logic, learning Haskell
  (the Ask-Elle programming tutor) and evaluating Haskell expressions, and for
  practicing communication skills (the serious game Communicate!).
