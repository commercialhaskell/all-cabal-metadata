  ideas-1.3.1 => ideas.1.4\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*
  refactoring of strategies\n  - strategies are now represented cyclic trees (that
  preserve fixpoints)\n  - new strategy combinators can be defined outside the framework\n
  \ - simpler interfaces: no more Builder, Step, and Core datatypes\n  - nice speed-up
  for constructing and running strategies\n  \n* support for new database schema (v2)
  with more columns\n  - request can have an optional 'logging' attribute (false,
  v1, v2)\n  - command-line flag for seeing information that is logged \n  - userid,
  sessionid, and taskid are stored in a state\n\n* changing license to Apache License
  version 2.0 (was: GPL)\n* renaming strategy combinators (eg .*.) to solve clash
  with Applicative.<*> \n* adding SyntaxError constructor to Diagnose datatype\n*
  added read instance for Difficulty\n* changed newline and tab escaping in JSON\n*
  re-implemented atomic combinator\n* introduced inits combinator  (initial prefixes)
  and atomic prefix (!~>)\n* introduced somewhereWhen traversal combinator\n* added
  cabal flag to resolve dependency on network >= 2.6\n* added cabal flag to enable

description: |-
  Ideas (Interactive Domain-specific Exercise Assistants) is a joint research
  project between the Open University of the Netherlands and Utrecht
  University. The project's goal is to use software and compiler technology to
  build state-of-the-art components for intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) and
  learning environments. The 'ideas' software package provides a generic
  framework for constructing the expert knowledge module (also known as a
  domain reasoner) for an ITS or learning environment. Domain knowledge is
  offered as a set of feedback services that are used by external tools such
  as the digital mathematical environment (DME), MathDox, and the Math-Bridge
  system. We have developed several domain reasoners based on this framework,
  including reasoners for mathematics, linear algebra, logic, learning Haskell
  (the Ask-Elle programming tutor) and evaluating Haskell expressions, and for
  practicing communication skills (the serious game Communicate!).
