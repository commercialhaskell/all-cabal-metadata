  ===================

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/tcp-streams-openssl.svg?style=flat)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tcp-streams-openssl)
  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/didi-FP/tcp-streams.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/didi-FP/tcp-streams)

  This package provides TLS support based on [tcp-streams](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tcp-streams) using [HsOpenSSL](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/HsOpenSSL). By default `tcp-streams` use `tls` package which is much easier to install but slightly slower.

  This package is split from `tcp-streams` due to the difficulties of setting up openssl on many platform. You may need manually passing openssl library path if linker can't find them:

  ```
  cabal install --extra-include-dirs=/usr/local/opt/openssl/include --extra-lib-dirs=/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib tcp-streams
  ```
