synopsis: A reliable way to detect the presence of a MinTTY console on Windows
changelog: |
  ### 0.1.4 [2022.06.30]
  * Remove an unused dependency on `filepath`.

  ### 0.1.3 [2021.11.07]
  * Backport a fix for a `Win32` bug that would make `isMinTTY` incorrectly
    return `False` on recent versions of MinTTY.

  ### 0.1.2 [2018.05.07]
  * Only use the `Win32`-provided version of `isMinTTY` if building against
    `Win32-2.5.3` to be certain that one avoids Trac #13431.
  * Don't enable `Safe` on GHC 7.2.

  ### 0.1.1 [2017.03.17]
  * Work around a serious bug on 32-bit Windows GHC that causes linker errors
    when mintty is used together with code that uses certain `msvcrt` functions,
    such as `atan`

  ## 0.1 [2017.01.30]

  MinTTY is a Windows-specific terminal emulator for the widely used Cygwin and MSYS projects, which provide Unix-like environments for Windows. MinTTY consoles behave differently from native Windows consoles (such as `cmd.exe` or PowerShell) in many ways, and in some cases, these differences make it necessary to treat MinTTY consoles differently in code.

  The `mintty` library provides a simple way to detect if your code in running in a MinTTY console on Windows. It exports `isMinTTY`, which does the right thing 90% of the time (by checking if standard error is attached to MinTTY), and it also exports `isMinTTYHandle` for the other 10% of the time (when you want to check is some arbitrary handle is attached to MinTTY). As you might expect, both of these functions will simply return `False` on any non-Windows operating system.
