description: |-
  Bindings to Miniball, a C++ library (<http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/gaertner/miniball.html>) for
  computing the smallest enclosing ball of a set of points in Euclidean space.

  The Miniball library itself is not included, as I consider it a dependency. It consists of only
  a header file, and can be retrieved from <http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/gaertner/miniball.html>.
  To build this package, simply have @miniball.hpp@ in GCC's include path. The standard C++ library
  and GCC with C++ support are also needed.

  Hackage probably fails to build the Haddock documentation since Miniball itself is missing. The
  documentation can be viewed at <http://nonempty.org/software/haskell-miniball/>.

  Miniball itself is copyright 1999-2013, Bernd Gärtner.

  The current version has only been tested with version 3.0 of Miniball.

  Changes in version 0.1.0.2:

  * Improve allocation before FFI call. Good speedup for short calls (factor 3 for 100000 points in R^3).
