changelog: |
  # 0.4.11.2

  * Fixed compilation on GHC 8.8 (thanks to @vmchale).

  # 0.4.11.1

  * Reverted marking `Lens.Micro.Internal` as `Trustworthy`, see [#122](https://github.com/monadfix/microlens/issues/122).

  # 0.4.11

  * Added fixity declarations for `+~` and `-~` (thanks to Francesco Ariis).
  * Added `rewriteOf` and `transformOf` (thanks to @quasicomputational).
  * Added an instance `Each (Either a a) (Either b b) a b`, following `lens`'s suit.
  * Marked `Lens.Micro.Internal` as `Trustworthy` starting from GHC 7.8.

  # 0.4.10

  * Added `+~` and `-~`.
  * Marked `#.` and `.#` with `INLINE`.

  # 0.4.9.1

  * Reexported `<&>` from `Data.Functor` (on recent versions of `base`).

  # 0.4.9

  * Added `<>~`.
  * Added fixities for `<%~`, `<<%~`, `<<.~`.

  # 0.4.8.3

  * Fixed compilation on GHC 8.4.

  # 0.4.8.2

  Skipped (the tarball got corrupted).

  # 0.4.8.1

  * Added `HasCallStack` for some partial functions.

  # 0.4.8.0

  * Added `forOf_` and `forOf`.
  * Added an instance for `Each (NonEmpty a)` (available starting from GHC 8).

  # 0.4.7.0

  * Fixed the [Haddock crash on GHC 8](https://github.com/monadfix/microlens/issues/72) by removing default method implementations (`each = traverse` and `ix = ixAt`). If you had custom instances of `Ixed` or `Each` which relied on default methods, they'd stop working.

  # 0.4.6.0

  * Added `traverseOf` and `traverseOf_`.
  * Changed fixities of `#.` and `.#` to the ones in the profunctors package. Those operators are only available from `Lens.Micro.Internal`, so this shouldn't affect most users.

  # 0.4.5.0

  * Added `<&>` (which makes lens creation easier).

  # 0.4.4.3

  * Fixed markup in the .cabal file.
  * Added descriptions of other packages to `Lens.Micro`.

  # 0.4.4.2

  * More changes to make microlens-platform more prominent.

  # 0.4.4.1

  * Pointed to microlens-platform in the synopsis.

  # 0.4.4.0

  * Added `mapAccumLOf`.

  # 0.4.3.0

  * Added `?~`.

  # 0.4.2.1

  * Added forgotten copyright/authorship information.

  # 0.4.2.0

  * Added `singular`.

  # 0.4.1.0

  * Added `strict` and `lazy`.

  # 0.4.0.1

  * Fixed a bug that wasn't letting the package compile with GHC 8.0 (see issue #63).

  # 0.4.0.0

  * Added `folding`.
  * Renamed `Getter` and `Fold` to `SimpleGetter` and `SimpleFold` and put them into `Lens.Micro`. Genuine `Getter` and `Fold` are available in microlens-contra.
  * Replaced `Applicative (Const r)` constraints with `Monoid r` because it's the same thing but easier to understand.

  # 0.3.5.1

  * Backported the fix for the bug that wasn't letting the package compile with GHC 8.0 (see issue #63).

  # 0.3.5.0

  * Added `Lens.Micro.Extras` with `view`, `preview`, `Getter`, and `Fold`. Now you no longer need microlens-mtl if the only thing you need from it is `view`.

  # 0.3.4.1

  * Changed the description of the package from “A tiny part of the lens library which you can depend upon” to “A tiny part of the lens library with no dependencies” because the previous one was ambiguous (I admit I kinda liked that ambiguity, though).

  # 0.3.4.0

  * Added `non`.

  # 0.3.3.0

  * Added `filtered`.
  * Added Safe Haskell pragmas.

  # 0.3.2.0

  * Added `toListOf` back.
  * Added `to`.

  # 0.3.1.0

  * Added `LensLike` and `LensLike'`.
  * Added `failing`.

  # 0.3.0.0

  * Moved `Lens.Micro.Classes` into `Lens.Micro.Internal`.
  * Added `<%~`, `<<%~`, `<<.~`.
  * Added `_head`, `_tail`, `_init`, `_last`.

  # 0.2.0.0

  * Removed `toListOf`.
  * Removed `+~`, `-~`, `*~`, `//~` and the `Lens.Micro.Extras` module.

  # 0.1.5.0

  * Added `ix` and `at`.
  * Added `traversed`.
  * Moved some things into `Lens.Micro.Internal`.
  * Bumped base version.

  # 0.1.3.0

  * Moved some things into `Lens.Micro.Type` and `Lens.Micro.Classes`.
  * `Each` and `Field*` aren't exported by `Lens.Micro` now.

  # 0.1.2.0

  * Added `each`.

  # 0.1.1.0

  * Added `ASetter'`, which is useful because we can't provide real `Setter` and `Setter'`.

  # 0.1.0.0

  First release.

  NOTE: If you're writing an app, you probably want <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-platform microlens-platform> – it has the most features. <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens microlens> is intended more for library writers who want a tiny lens library (after all, lenses are pretty useful for everything, not just for updating records!).

  This library is an extract from <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> (with no dependencies). It's not a toy lenses library, unsuitable for “real world”, but merely a small one. It is compatible with lens, and should have same performance. It also has better documentation.

  There's a longer readme <https://github.com/monadfix/microlens#readme on Github>. It has a migration guide for lens users, a description of other packages in the family, a discussion of other lens libraries you could use instead, and so on.

  Here are some usecases for this library:

  * You want to define lenses or traversals in your own library, but don't want to depend on lens. Having lenses available often make working with a library more pleasant.

  * You just want to be able to use lenses to transform data (or even just use @over _1@ to change the first element of a tuple).

  * You are new to lenses and want a small library to play with.

  However, don't use this library if:

  * You need @Iso@s, @Prism@s, indexed traversals, or actually anything else which isn't defined here (though some indexed functions are available elsewhere – containers and vector provide them for their types, and <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ilist ilist> provides indexed functions for lists).

  * You want a library with a clean, understandable implementation (in which case you're looking for <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-simple lens-simple>).

  As already mentioned, if you're writing an application which uses lenses more extensively, look at <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-platform microlens-platform> – it combines features of most other microlens packages (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-mtl microlens-mtl>, <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-th microlens-th>, <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-ghc microlens-ghc>).

  If you want to export getters or folds and don't mind the <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/contravariant contravariant> dependency, please consider using <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-contra microlens-contra>.

  If you haven't ever used lenses before, read <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-tutorial/docs/Control-Lens-Tutorial.html this tutorial>. (It's for lens, but it applies to microlens just as well.)

  Note that microlens has no dependencies starting from GHC 7.10 (base-4.8). Prior to that, it depends on transformers-0.2 or above.
