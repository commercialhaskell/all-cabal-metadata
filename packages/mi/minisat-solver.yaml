description: |-
  This package provides high-level Haskell bindings for the well-known
  MiniSat satisfiability solver. It solves the boolean satisfiability
  problem, i.e., the input is a boolean formula, and the output is a
  list of all satisfying assignments.
  MiniSat is a fully automated, well-optimized general-purpose SAT
  solver written by Niklas Een and Niklas Sorensson, and further
  modified by Takahisa Toda.
  Unlike other similar Haskell packages, we provide a convenient
  high-level interface to the SAT solver, hiding the complexity of the
  underlying C implementation. It can be easily integrated into other
  programs as an efficient turn-key solution to many search problems.
  To illustrate the use of the library, two example programs are
  included in the "examples" directory; one program solves Sudoku
  puzzles, and the other solves a 3-dimensional block packing
  problem. These programs can be built manually, or by invoking Cabal
  with the '--enable-benchmarks' option.
