description: "# min-max-pqueue\n\nA min-max priority queue provides efficient access
  to both its least element\nand its greatest element. Also known as\n[double-ended
  priority queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-ended_priority_queue).\n\nThis
  library provides two variants of min-max priority queues:\n\n- [`MinMaxQueue prio
  a`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/min-max-pqueue/docs/Data-MinMaxQueue.html),
  a general-purpose min-max priority queue.\n- [`IntMinMaxQueue a`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/min-max-pqueue/docs/Data-IntMinMaxQueue.html),
  a min-max priority queue where priority values are integers.\n\nA min-max priority
  queue can be configured with a maximum size. Each time an insertion\ncauses the
  queue to grow beyond the size limit, the greatest element\nwill be automatically
  removed (rather than rejecting the insertion).\n\nTheir implementations are backed
  by `Map prio (NonEmpty a)` and\n`IntMap (NonEmpty a)`, respectively. This means\nthat
  certain operations are asymptotically more expensive than\nimplementations [backed
  by mutable arrays](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=6621),\ne.g., `peekMin` and
  `peekMax` is *O(n* log *n)* vs. *O(n)*, `fromList` is\nalso *O(n* log *n)* vs. *O(n)*.
  In a pure language like Haskell, a\nmutable array based implementation would be
  impure\nand need to operate inside monads. And in many applications, regardless\nof
  language, the additional time complexity would be a small or negligible\nprice to
  pay to avoid destructive updates anyway.\n\nIf you only access one end of the queue
  (i.e., you need a regular\npriority queue), an implementation based on a kind of
  heap that is more\namenable to purely functional implementations, such as binomial
  heap\nand pairing heap, is *potentially* more efficient. But always benchmark\nif
  performance is important; in my experience `Map` *always* wins, even for\nregular
  priority queues.\n\n## Advantages over Using Maps Directly\n\n- `size` is *O(1)*,
  vs. *O(n)* for maps. Note that `Data.Map.size` is *O(1)* but it\n  returns the number
  of keys, which is not the same as the number of elements in\n  the queue. `Data.IntMap.size`,
  on the other hand, is *O(k)* where *k* is\n  the number of keys.\n- A queue can
  have a size limit, and it is guaranteed that its size\n  does not grow beyond the
  limit.\n- Many useful operations, such as `takeMin`, `dropMin`, are non-trivial
  to\n  implement with `Map prio (NonEmpty a)` and `IntMap (NonEmpty a)`.\n- The queue's
  fold operations operate on individual elements, as opposed to\n  `NonEmpty a`.\n\n\n##
  Alternative Implementation\n\nIn Haskell, an alternative to the mutable array based
  implementation is\nto use immutable, general purpose arrays such as `Seq`. This
  would achieve\n*O(1)* `peekMin` and `peekMax`, but since `lookup` and `update` for
  `Seq`\ncost *O(n* log  *n)*, the cost of `insert`, `deleteMin` and `deleteMax` would\nbecome
  *O(n* log<sup>2</sup> *n)*.\n\n[A `Seq`-based implementation](https://github.com/zliu41/min-max-pqueue/blob/master/benchmark/SeqQueue.hs)
  is provided for benchmarking purposes, which,\nas shown below, is more than an order
  of magnitude slower than the `Map`-based implementation\nfor enqueuing and dequeuing
  200,000 elements, proving that the improved\ntime complexity of `peekMin` and `peekMax`
  is not worth the cost. In fact,\nif you perform `peekMin` and `peekMax` much more
  often than enqueuing and\ndequeuing operations, which means you perform `peekMin`
  and `peekMax` many times\non the same queue, you should simply memoize the results.\n\n##
  Benchmarks\n\nBenchmarking was done on my laptop in which 200,000 elements (which
  are\nintegers) are inserted into the queue and subsequently removed one after\nanother.\n\n-
  `pq`, `intpq` and `sq` represents `MinMaxQueue`, `IntMinMaxQueue` and\n  `SeqQueue`.\n-
  `asc`, `desc` and `rand` represents inserting the elements in ascending,\n  descending
  and random order.\n- `min` and `max` represents removing elements from the min-end
  and max-end.\n\nAs seen in the following result, `IntMinMaxQueue` is twice as fast
  as\n`MinMaxQueue` for integer keys, whereas `SeqQueue` is more than an order\nof
  magnitude slower.\n\n```\nbenchmarking intpq-asc-min          \ntime                 27.15
