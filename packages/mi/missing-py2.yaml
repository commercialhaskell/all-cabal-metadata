  # missing-py2 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/domdere/missing-py2.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/domdere/missing-py2)

  A fork of John Goerzen's [**MissingPy**] [softmechanics-missingpy]

  Updated to run with **GHC 7.6.3** and run with **Python 2.7.3**, for maintaining projects with existing MissingPy dependencies.

  see the original documentation for that project [**here**](./MissingPy.md).

  # Usage

  Just add `missing-py2` to your `build-depends` list, e.g:

      build-depends:
              base < 5 && >= 4
          ,   missing-py2

  The original documentation prescribes that the `OverlappingInstances` **GHC** extension is neccessary anywhere you use the `Python.*` modules.

  That **may** be neccessary, however the unit tests seem to run fine without it now.

  Don't forget to run `py_initialize` from `Python.Interpreter` during the start up phase of your application

  Requires the `python-dev` libs, which can be installed on Ubuntu with `sudo apt-get install python-dev`.

  -   [**cpython**](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cpython "cpython on hackage") : Another set of `libpython` bindings (looks more well-maintained),
      this would probably be preferable for new projects.
