description: |-
  This is a game like Memory but with tones instead of images.

  There is a grid of buttons and each button plays a tone when pressed.
  Every tone is connected to two buttons.
  The players must find the pairs of buttons with equal tones.
  The two players alternatingly test pairs of buttons.
  If one selects a pair of buttons with equal tones,
  then his score is increased by one
  and he is allowed to perform another attempt.

  In order to play the tones
  you must connect it to a hardware or software synthesizer
  like Timidity or FluidSynth.

  > timidity -A300 -iA -B4,4

  Then start the midimory game and connect the game to the synthesizer:

  > midimory --connect-to TiMidity

  or alternatively:

  > midimory &
  > aconnect Midimory TiMidity
