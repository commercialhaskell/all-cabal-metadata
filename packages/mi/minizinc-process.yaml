  minizinc-process
  ================

  MiniZinc is a language and a toolchain to solve discrete optimization problems.
  This package offers wrappers around the `minizinc` executable to pass inputs and outputs.

  Assume that a primitive MiniZinc model is available at the path `models/example001.mzn`.

  ```minizinc
  0..100: x;
  var int: y;
  constraint x < y;
  ```

  This model expects `x` as an Int and decides `y` as an Int if a solution is
  found. Ideally we would like to use minizinc and this model like a function of
  type `Int -> IO (Maybe Int)` function in Haskell.
  This package provides building blocks to create such a mapping.

  # Implementation

  This package relies on JSON support for MiniZinc by using JSON as an
  intermediary representation. On the Haskell side we picked the popular `aeson`
  package for serializing values.

  MiniZinc input binds names to variables, hence the `Int -> IO (Maybe Int)`
  example above is insufficient: inputs and outputs need to translate to JSON
  `Object` constructor of [Aeson's Value type](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson-1.1.1.0/docs/Data-Aeson.html#t:Value).

  # Example Use

  The `runLastMinizincJSON` function requires some configuration object to
  provide parameters like the solver backing MiniZinc, the timeout, where to
  store MiniZinc data files. The `simpleMiniZinc` function provides a smart
  constructor for building such an environment.

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications #-}

  module Main where

  import Data.Aeson
  import Data.Hashable
  import GHC.Generics
  import Process.Minizinc
  import Process.Minizinc.Inspect

  data Input = Input {x :: Int}
    deriving (Generic)

  instance ToJSON Input -- required by `runLastMinizincJSON` for serialization of input

  instance Hashable Input -- required by `simpleMiniZinc` to create a somewhat unique filepath

  data Output = Output {y :: Int}
    deriving (Show, Generic)

  instance FromJSON Output -- required by `runLastMinizincJSON` for deserialization of output

  main :: IO ()
  main = do
    inspect "models/example001.mzn" >>= print
    let mzn = simpleMiniZinc @Input @Output "models/example001.mzn" 1000 Gecode
    let problem = Input 10
    runLastMinizincJSON mzn problem >>= print
  ```

  The `@Input` and `@Output` syntax allow to pass type parameters to
  `simpleMiniZinc`, this style is optional but helps the GHC compiler inference
  (in our example, this type application is the only indication needed to tell
  the compiler to deserialize `Output` objects).

  A more-general function named `runMinizincJSON` allows to stream results
  iteratively has the solver progresses. This function is more complicated than
  `runLastMinizincJSON` has it takes a callback to consume an output and control
  whether to continue reading inputs or not (i.e., a coroutine) plus some initial
  state that is carried over (a bit like a fold). Luckily, we provide two
  coroutines `keepLast` and `collectResults` for some typical use cases.

  # Usage in a project

  ## MiniZinc model files

  In a typical project, you will have fixed models and varying inputs.
  That is, you would like to carry the models along with the code (e.g., a web
  application or gRPC server using minizinc in the background) in a same
  repository as your Haskell code. One option is to leverage the support of cabal
  [data-files](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/developing-packages.html#accessing-data-files-from-package-code).

  ## Serialization and DeSerialization

  You will still need some mapping functions to translate between domain objects
  like `User` into the JSON values that MiniZinc requires: objects do not map
  well with relations. We may consider compile-time helpers like TemplateHaskell,
  but at this time it would not be immediately feasible. Be at peace with this.

  A module named `Process.Minizinc.TH` has TemplateHaskell functions to
  generate. As of today, you'll still need to activate some extensions and
  import some libraries so that the TemplateHaskell-generated code compiles: as in the following example.

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE DeriveAnyClass #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}

  import Data.Aeson
  import Data.Hashable
  import Process.Minizinc.TH
  import GHC.Generics

  genModelData "MyModel" "models/mymodel.mzn"
  ```

  ```minizinc
  int: x;
  array[1..2,1..2] of int: y;
  var int: z;

  ...
  ```

  Will generate the following haskell codes

  ```haskell
  data MyModelOutput = MyModelOutput {
    z :: Int
  } deriving (Show, Eq, Ord, Generic, Hashable, ToJSON, FromJSON)

  data MyModelInput = MyModelInput {
    x :: Int,
    y :: [[Int]]
  } deriving (Show, Eq, Ord, Generic, Hashable, ToJSON, FromJSON)
  ```

  See `examples/Main.hs` for an example usage of TemplateHaskell.


  ## Temporary data files

  For now, the implementation leverages file-system to pass the JSON object to
  MiniZinc, this design means you should pay attention to disk usage and maybe
  clean the clutter. A function named `cleanTmpFile` will remove the `.json` disk
  file for a given pair of MiniZinc and input objects.

  # Development

  ## Testing

  We use [Hedgehog](https://hedgehog.qa/) to test the overall system at once rather than having
  individual tests for the internal parser and other files.

  Test cases are in `.hs` files under the `test` directory whereas the `.mzn`
  models are in the `models` directory.
  We use a naming nomenclature to help organize what files require what
  input/output types: `test{inputtype}_{testnum}.mzn` where `inputtype` pertains
  to the haskell Input/Output types and `testnum` pertains to the test number.
  Thus: all `testnum` are unique and are groupable by `inputtype`.
