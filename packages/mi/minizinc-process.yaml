  minizinc-process
  ================

  MiniZinc is a language and a toolchain to solve discrete optimization problems.
  This package offers wrappers around the `minizinc` executable to pass inputs and outputs.

  Assume that a primitive MiniZinc model is available at the path `models/example001.mzn`.

  ```minizinc
  0..100: x;
  var int: y;
  constraint x < y;
  ```

  This model expects `x` as an Int and decides `y` as an Int if a solution is
  found. Ideally we would like to use minizinc and this model like a function of
  type `Int -> IO (Maybe Int)` function in Haskell.
  This package provides building blocks to create such a mapping.

  # Implementation

  This package relies on JSON support for MiniZinc by using JSON as an
  intermediary representation. On the Haskell side we picked the popular `aeson`
  package for serializing values.

  MiniZinc input binds names to variables, hence the `Int -> IO (Maybe Int)`
  example above is insufficient: inputs and outputs need to translate to JSON
  `Object` constructor of [Aeson's Value type](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson-1.1.1.0/docs/Data-Aeson.html#t:Value).

  # Example Use

  The `runLastMinizincJSON` function requires some configuration object to
  provide parameters like the solver backing MiniZinc, the timeout, where to
  store MiniZinc data files. The `simpleMiniZinc` function provides a smart
  constructor for building such an environment.

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications #-}

  module Main where

  import Data.Aeson
  import Data.Hashable
  import GHC.Generics
  import Process.Minizinc
  import Process.Minizinc.Inspect

  data Input = Input {x :: Int}
    deriving (Generic)

  instance ToJSON Input -- required for `runLastMinizincJSON`

  instance Hashable Input -- required for `runLastMinizincJSON`

  data Output = Output {y :: Int}
    deriving (Show, Generic)

  instance FromJSON Output -- required for `runLastMinizincJSON`

  main :: IO ()
  main = do
    inspect "models/example001.mzn" >>= print
    let mzn = simpleMiniZinc @Input @Output "models/example001.mzn" 1000 Gecode
    let problem = Input 10
    runLastMinizincJSON mzn problem >>= print
  ```

  The `@Input` and `@Output` syntax allow to pass type parameters to
  `simpleMiniZinc`, this style is optional but helps the GHC compiler inference
  (in our example, this type application is the only indication needed to tell
  the compiler to deserialize `Output` objects).
