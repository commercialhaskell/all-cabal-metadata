description: |-
  A set of simplistic functions capturing the more regular
  parts of English spelling (for generation, not parsing).
  You will need to complement this with some account for
  irregular nouns/verbs. This package is not meant to provide
  anything resembling a full account of English morphology
  (something like Functional Morphology or sequor could be
  better suited). The main goal is to provide something cheap
  and cheerful with no learning curve, that you can use until
  your application calls for more robustness.
  See <https://github.com/Mikolaj/miniutter> for a simple
  use case.
