  # A tiny Haskell library for timing IO actions.

  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/thoughtpolice/hs-microtimer.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/thoughtpolice/hs-microtimer)

  This package contains a very simple module for benchmarking `IO`
  actions. It was taken from [criterion][].

  The API simply provides:

  ```haskell
  -- | Time an 'IO' action and return the time taken for execution,
  -- as well as the return value.
  time :: IO a -> IO (Double, a)

  -- | Time an 'IO' action, throwing away the result and returning
  -- the time taken for execution.
  time_ :: IO a -> IO Double

  -- | Convert a 'Double' value into a 'String' which specifies
  -- how long something took in seconds.
  formatSeconds :: Double -> String
  ```

  # Installation

  It's just a `cabal install` away on [Hackage][]:

  $ cabal install microtimer
  ```
