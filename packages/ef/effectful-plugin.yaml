  # `effectful-plugin`

  A GHC plugin for improving disambiguation of effects.

  ## Usage

  To enable the plugin, add the following GHC option to your project file:

  ```
  ghc-options: -fplugin=Effectful.Plugin
  ```

  ## What it does

  The following code:

  ```haskell
  action :: (State Int :> es, State String :> es) => Eff es ()
  action = do
    x <- get
    put (x + 1)
  ```

  will not compile out of the box because `GHC` doesn't know that you meant to
  `get` an `Int` since the function `+` as well as the literal `1` are
  polymorphic. You have to write:

  ```haskell
  action :: (State Int :> es, State String :> es) => Eff es ()
  action = do
    x <- get @Int
    put (x + 1)
  ```

  Which is slightly annoying. This plugin tells `GHC` extra information so code
  like this can type-check without having to spell types to the compiler.
