description: |-
  When using monad transformer stacks, it is common to want
  to mix effects from various layers of the stack within a
  single block of code. The @lift@ operation can be used to
  convert an action that uses effects at some deep layer of
  the stack into one that works in the full stack. It
  quickly becomes tedious to include exactly the right
  number of calls to @lift@ each time they are needed; and
  makes the code more fragile when the transformer stack is
  changed (e.g. to include a new effect).

  The @mtl@ package provides a convenient way to point to a
  particular layer of the stack, under the assumption that
  there is exactly one "kind" of each interesting effect.
  (For example, one can only have one type of state, one
  type of environment to read from, and so forth.) However,
  if one wishes to have to copies of a single kind of
  effect, there is no convenient, generic way to choose
  anything other than the one that appears topmost in the
  stack. For example, for a stack that contains two
  @StateT@s in it, one can write code that accesses the
  outermost state using a type like

  @MonadState outer m => m ()@

  but there is no polymorphic way to reach the inner
  @StateT@'s state. One is back to writing fragile code that
  depends on exactly which transformer stack was chosen.

  This package provides a way to make such choices
  generically: it introduces a separate stack for each kind
  of effect, and provides an operation for popping one layer
  of a given effect's stack. Continuing the @StateT@
  example, one could write

  @MonadState outer m => m ()@

  as before for the outermost state, or

  @(StateStack m, MonadState inner (PopState m)) => m ()@

  to access the state from underneath the outermost
  @StateT@, no matter how deep it is.
