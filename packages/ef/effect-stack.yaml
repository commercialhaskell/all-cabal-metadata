  for building up monad\ntransformer stacks that combine just the right mix of effects
  for a given\napplication. For example, in a compiler, we might want to combine `IO`
  effects\nfor reading and writing files, a scoping environment effect, the ability
  to\nreport warnings and errors, state for generating fresh variable names or\ntracking
  type unification information, and so on. We might cook up a quite\ncomplicated stack
  like\n\n    type Compiler = ReaderT ScopingInformation\n                  ( StateT
  UnificationState\n                  ( ExceptT TypeError\n                  ( WriterT
  [Warning]\n                  ( StateT FreshNameGenerator\n                  ( IO\n
  \                 )))))\n\nto capture all of these effects in one monad.\n\nWith
  just the tools provided by the `transformers` package, though, this type\ncan be
  somewhat frustrating to use. Getting access to the `WriterT [Warning]`\npart of
  the stack, for example, involves lifting the write effect through three\nlayers
  of the stack using something like:\n\n    warn :: Warning -> Compiler ()\n    warn
  w = lift (lift (lift (tell [w])))\n\nBesides being tedious, this also calcifies
  the monad stack; if later we\ndiscover we got the stack in the wrong order, or decide
  we need to add another\neffect, we would need to revisit all the places where we
  did such lifting and\nreconsider exactly how many occurrences of `lift` there should
  be.\n\nThe `mtl` package addresses this problem by adding one typeclass for each
  kind\nof effect. (Transformers which don't provide that effect pass it through.)
  This\ngives us two benefits:\n\n1. We can write type signatures that constrict us
  to using fewer effects than\n   our top-level application monad actually provides,
  and get the compiler to\n   check that we have really used only those effects. These
  actions can still\n   be used in the richer top-level application monad.\n2. The
  need for explicitly `lift`ing is drastically reduced, with the typeclass\n   resolution
  mechanism inferring the correct number of `lift`s for us.\n\nFor example, using
  that library, we might write\n\n    warn :: MonadWriter [Warning] m => m ()\n    warn
  w = tell [w]\n\nwhich now continues to work even if we change the monad stack later,
  provided\nwe retain the property of having just one `WriterT` in the stack. The
  three\nuses of `lift` are inferred, and will be adjusted up or down as needed as
  the\ntop-level application monad changes.\n\nHowever, if one wishes to have two
  or more copies of a single kind of effect,\nthere is no convenient, generic way
  to choose anything other than the one that\nappears topmost in the stack. With our
  `Compiler` monad above, for example, we\nmight write\n\n    unify :: MonadState
  UnificationState m => Type -> Type -> m ()\n    unify t1 t2 = get >>= \\us -> ...\n\nto
  get access to the unification state. But if we want to access the\n`FreshNameGenerator`,
  we are back to writing fragile `lift`-based code:\n\n    freshName :: Compiler Name\n
  \   freshName = lift (lift (lift (lift (modify (...)))))\n\nWe can, with some effort
  and perhaps a confusing type signature, retain some of\nthe benefits of indicating
  in the type exactly which effects are used by mixing\n`mtl`-style actions with `transformers`-style
  `lift`ing, though I dare say this\nstyle is as yet not very popular:\n\n    freshName
  :: (MonadTrans t1, MonadTrans t2, MonadState FreshNameGenerator m) => t1 (t2 m)
  Name\n    freshName = lift (lift (modify (...)))\n\nThe fragility of `lift` remains,
  though.\n\nThe `effect-stack` package addresses this problem, providing a way to
  choose\nlower layers of the monad stack generically and without explicitly writing
  the\ncorrect number of `lift`s. It introduces a separate stack for each kind of\neffect,
  and provides an operation for popping one layer of a given effect's\nstack. For
  example, we can still write\n\n    unify :: MonadState UnificationState m => Type
  -> Type -> m ()\n\nfor actions that access the topmost state, but with this library
  we can also write\n\n    freshName :: (StateStack m, MonadState FreshNameGenerator
  (PopState m)) => m Name\n\nto access the state from underneath the outermost `StateT`,
  no matter how deep\nit is. We can implement this type using `liftState`; for example:\n\n
  \   freshName = liftState (modify (...))\n\nThe typeclass resolution mechanism will
  turn `liftState` into the correct\nnumber of `lift`s to get from one `StateT` to
  the next.\n\nOur `Compiler` monad has only two kinds of state, but one could imagine
  needing\na third. Writing down the type for accessing the third type shows that
  using the\nprimitive `StateStack` and `PopState` operations quickly becomes tedious
  with\ndeep stacks:\n\n    thirdStateGet :: (StateStack m, StateStack (PopState m),
  MonadState X (PopState (PopState m))) => m X\n    thirdStateGet = liftState (liftState
  get)\n\nConsequently, the library also provides some type families and operations
  that\nease this iteration. Using them, we can also write `thirdStateGet` this way:\n\n
  \   thirdStateGet :: MonadStateDepth 2 m X => m X\n    thirdStateGet = depthState
  @2 get\n\nOf course, and unfortunately, inferred types will still use the fully-expanded\nform,
  but at least the human-written types can be a bit prettier.\n\n# Naming conventions\n\nThere
  is one module per kind of effect, named `Control.Monad.Stack.<Effect>`.\nGenerally,
  if there is a class for the effect, we drop the initial `Monad` from\nthe class
  name and use that as the name of the effect (e.g. `MonadState` &rarr;\n`State`).
  Otherwise we use the final part of the module name from\n`transformers` as the effect
  name (e.g. `Control.Monad.Trans.Accum` &rarr;\n`Accum`). Each module exports the
  following things:\n\n* A typeclass for popping one layer of that kind of effect
  off the stack at a\n  time. This should generally be viewed as a low-level tool,
  but it may also be\n  independently useful.\n    * The class is named `<Effect>Stack`.\n
  \   * There is an associated type family `Pop<Effect>`; it takes a monad, and\n
  \     removes enough transformers to drop the outermost transformer of the\n      current
  kind of effect. For example, `PopState Compiler` would throw away\n      the outermost
  `ReaderT` and `StateT`, leaving a new stack that began at\n      the `ExceptT`.\n
  \   * There is a method `lift<Effect>`; it applies `lift` the appropriate\n      number
  of times to take an action one layer down in the effect stack and\n      lift it
  to the full monad.\n* A type alias `<Effect>Depth`. It takes a type-level number
  and a monad, and\n  calls `Pop<Effect>` the given number of times on the monad.
  This should\n  probably also be considered a low-level tool.\n* A type alias `<Effect>Constraints`.
  It takes a type-level number and a monad,\n  and produces a constraint saying that
  you are permitted to call `Pop<Effect>`\n  and `lift<Effect>` the given number of
  times with the monad. For transformers\n  with no associated class, this will likely
  be the most commonly-used\n  type-level export.\n* A function `depth<Effect>`. It
  takes a type-level number and a monadic\n  action, and calls `lift<Effect>` the
  given number of times on the action.\n  This will most likely be the most commonly-used
  computation-level export.\n\nFor effects that are associated with a class, the module
  will also export:\n\n* A type alias `Monad<Effect>Depth`. It takes a type-level
  number and a monad\n  as its first two arguments. For classes which have other parameters
  than the\n  monad, those parameters follow in the same order that the `Monad<Effect>`\n
  \ class demands them. (But note that the monad always comes before the other\n  arguments,
  unlike in `mtl`!) It produces a constraint saying that you can\n  call `Pop<Effect>`
  and `lift<Effect>` the given number of times with the\n  monad, and that if you
  call `Pop<Effect>` the given number of times then the\n  result is an instance of
  `Monad<Effect> <args>`. This will likely be the most\n  commonly-used type-level
  export when it is available.\n\n# How do I...\n\n## ...use the library to write
  monadic actions?\n\nGenerally, you will mix `mtl`-style classes for identifying
  what effect you\nwant and `effect-stack`-style classes for identifying which layer
  of your\ntransformer should provide that effect. In what follows, we will recap
  the\n`Compiler` example from the \"Why?\" section, including a complete, compilable\nfile
  demonstrating simple usage of `effect-stack`. First some imports, data\ndeclarations,
  and other standard-ish nonsense:\n\n    {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}\n    {-# LANGUAGE
  FlexibleContexts #-}\n    {-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications #-}\n\n    -- base\n    import
  System.Exit\n\n    -- mtl\n    import Control.Monad.Reader\n    import Control.Monad.State\n
  \   import Control.Monad.Writer\n    import Control.Monad.Except\n\n    -- effect-stack\n
  \   import Control.Monad.Stack.State\n    import Control.Monad.Stack.Error\n\n    type
  Compiler = ReaderT ScopingInformation\n                  ( StateT UnificationState\n
  \                 ( ExceptT TypeError\n                  ( WriterT [Warning]\n                  (
  StateT FreshNameGenerator\n                  ( IO\n                  )))))\n\n    type
  Name = String\n    type ScopingInformation = [Name]\n    type UnificationState =
  ()\n    type Type = ()\n    type TypeError = (Type, Type)\n    type Warning = String\n
  \   type FreshNameGenerator = Int\n\n    runCompiler :: Compiler a -> IO a\n    runCompiler
  act = do\n    \t(res, warnings) <- evalStateT (runWriterT (runExceptT (evalStateT
  (runReaderT act []) ()))) 0\n    \ttraverse putStrLn warnings\n    \tcase res of\n
  \   \t\tLeft err -> die (show err)\n    \t\tRight a -> pure a\n\nNow for some actual
  good stuff. We can still use `mtl`-style polymorphism\nfreely when there is no ambiguity
  about which part of the stack should provide\na particular effect. For example,
  `Compiler` has only one `WriterT`, so there's\nno problem knowing which `tell` to
  use:\n\n    warn :: MonadWriter [Warning] m => Warning -> m ()\n    warn w = tell
  [w]\n\nSimilarly, if we want to use the top-level state, we can still use `mtl`
  if we\nwant:\n\n    unify :: ( MonadState UnificationState m\n             , MonadError
  TypeError m\n             ) => Type -> Type -> m ()\n    unify t1 t2 = do\n    \tus
  <- get\n    \tif t1 == t2\n    \tthen put ()\n    \telse throwError (t1, t2)\n\nAlternately,
  we can write the same type signature using `effect-stack` types\nexplicitly saying
  that we want these effects to be provided by the top-most\ntransformer that can
  provide them:\n\n    unify' :: ( MonadStateDepth 0 m UnificationState\n              ,
  MonadErrorDepth 0 m TypeError\n              ) => Type -> Type -> m ()\n    unify'
  t1 t2 = do\n    \tus <- get\n    \tif t1 == t2\n    \tthen put ()\n    \telse throwError
  (t1, t2)\n\nEach kind of effect's stack is 0-indexed, so the outermost layer is
  layer 0. If\nwe want to access effects not provided by the top-most transformer,
  then we\nmust use `effect-stack` types (like `MonadStateDepth`) and methods (like\n`depthState`).\n\n
  \   freshName :: MonadStateDepth 1 m FreshNameGenerator => m Name\n    freshName
  = depthState @1 $ do\n    \tmodify (1+)\n    \tgets show\n\nWe can also mix and
  match, both at the type level (using `mtl`, `base`, and\n`effect-stack` classes),
  and within `do` blocks at the computation level (using\n`mtl`-style transformer
  polymorphic methods, `base`-style polymorphic lifting\nmethods, and `effect-stack`-style
  polymorphic lifting methods).\n\n    debug :: ( MonadStateDepth 1 m FreshNameGenerator\n
  \            , MonadReader ScopingInformation m\n             , MonadIO m\n             )
  => m ()\n    debug = do\n    \tn <- depthState @1 get\n    \tenv <- ask\n    \tliftIO
  (print (n, env))\n\nHere's a `main` that exists just to show that all the pieces
  can now be\nspecialized to the `Compiler` type as we wanted:\n\n    main :: IO ()\n
  \   main = runCompiler $ do\n    \tunify () ()\n    \twarn \"PHP is still more popular
  than Haskell.\"\n    \tv <- freshName\n    \tlocal (v:) $ do\n    \t\tunify' ()
  ()\n    \t\tdebug\n\nRunning it exits successfully after printing\n\n    (1,[\"1\"])\n
  \   PHP is still more popular than Haskell.\n\n## ...use a new transformer with
  existing kinds of effects?\n\nYou can write new instances for the existing effect
  stack classes for your\ntransformer. You must first decide whether the transformer
  you are writing an\ninstance for provides the effect the class provides a stack
  for or not. For\nexample, for the `StateStack` class, does your transformer provide
  access to\nsome kind of stateful effect?\n\nIf it does, write an instance in which
  the `Pop<Effect>` family immediately\nreturns the monad being transformed, and `lift<Effect>`
  is just `lift`. For\nexample, because the `AccumT` family of transformers provides
  the\n`Accum`ulation effect, the library provides this instance:\n\n    instance
  (Monad m, Monoid w) => AccumStack (AccumT w m) where\n    \ttype PopAccum (AccumT
  w m) = m\n    \tliftAccum = lift\n\nThe `(Monad m, Monoid w)` constraints are needed
  to satisfy the `Monad`\nsuperclass of `AccumStack`; all the `<Effect>Stack` classes
  have this\nsuperclass for user convenience.\n\nIf your transformer does not provide
  the effect, you should write an instance\nthat passes everything down one layer:
  `Pop<Effect>` should recurse on the\ntransformed monad, and `lift<Effect>` should
  be `lift . lift<Effect>`. For\nexample, since `MaybeT` does not provide `Accum`ulation
  effects, the library\nprovides this instance:\n\n    instance AccumStack m => AccumStack
  (MaybeT m) where\n    \ttype PopAccum (MaybeT m) = PopAccum m\n    \tliftAccum =
  lift . liftAccum\n\n## ...create an effect stack for a new kind of effect?\n\nYou
  will want to create a new class for the effect that provides the low-level\ntools
  for popping one layer of the stack at a time at the type level and\nlifting one
  layer at a time at the computation level. Once you have done that,\nthere are some
  tools in `Control.Monad.Stack.Internal` that will be helpful for\ncreating the high-level
  interface that accepts type-level numbers and iterates\nthe low-level operations.\n\nThe
  classes are all quite similar to each other; you should be able to follow\nthe exact
  same pattern for each new effect. The class itself should look like\nthis:\n\n    class
  Monad m => <Effect>Stack m where\n    \ttype Pop<Effect> m :: * -> *\n    \tlift<Effect>
  :: Pop<Effect> m a -> m a\n\nAt this point you will need to choose a type-level
  token that can uniquely\nidentify this kind of effect. The type families that need
  this token as an\nargument are poly-kinded and will accept a token of any kind here.
  For most of\nthe effects in this library, the token was chosen to be one of the
  transformers\nthat is typically used to provide the effect. You may also simply
  invent a new\ntype without exporting it if you are paranoid about collisions. Once
  you have\nchosen a token, make a mapping from the token to the family created above:\n\n
  \   type instance Pop <Token> m = Pop<Effect> m\n\nThis token may now be passed
  to `IteratePop`, `StackConstraints`, and `depth`\nto provide the high-level interface:\n\n
  \   type <Effect>Depth n m = IteratePop n <Token> m\n    type <Effect>Constraints
  n m = (KnownNat n, StackConstraints n <Token> <Effect>Stack m)\n\n    depth<Effect>
  :: forall n m a. <Effect>Constraints n m a => <Effect>Depth n m a -> m a\n    depth<Effect>
  = depth @n @<Token> @<Effect>Stack lift<Effect>\n\nIf there is a class associated
  with the effect, you may also want to offer a\nsuitably stackified version of that
  class:\n\n    type Monad<Effect>Depth n m <args> =\n    \t( <Effect>Constraints
  n m\n    \t, Monad<Effect> <args> (<Effect>Depth n m)\n    \t)\n\nYou will probably
  also want to write a bunch of instances for existing\ntransformers. See the section
  \"How do I...\", subsection \"...use a new\ntransformer with existing kinds of effects?\"
  for more information on doing\nthis.\n\n# Why not...\n\n## ...type-based resolution?\n\nOne
  alternate method of selecting which of many copies of an effect to use from\na stack
  would be to look at the type being used for that effect. For example,\ncontinuing
  the `Compiler` example form the \"Why?\" section, one might imagine\nthat one could
  write a class which used type inference to decide whether the\ncurrent stateful
  actions were mucking about with `FreshNameGenerator`s or\n`UnificationState`s, and
  use that information to decide whether to `lift` once\nor four times.\n\nThis approach
  has two main drawbacks:\n\n1. It turns out that type inference fails to differentiate
  between the two\n   situations surprisingly often. This puts an unusually high type-annotation\n
  \  burden on users. (Indeed, this is the standard justification for the\n   functional
  dependency included in all `mtl` typeclasses.)\n2. It still leaves you open to the
  problem of mixing effects which just happen,\n   by coincidence, to need access
  to the same type in the effect. For example,\n   suppose your compiler is tracking
  how many tab characters it has seen so\n   that it can issue an appropriate warning.
  Even so, some local module might\n   want to slap a transformer on top to add an
  effect for tracking the arity of\n   the function currently being compiled. These
  both happen to be `Int`s, and\n   so once again we have a disambiguation problem.\n\n##
  ...type-level tags?\n\nOne could imagine adding a tag to each transformer, and using
  the tags to\ndifferentiate which effect is wanted. For example, with suitably modified\ntransformers,
  one might write:\n\n    data Tag = Unification | Fresh | Other\n    type Compiler
  = ReaderT Other ScopingInformation\n                  ( StateT Unification UnificationState\n
  \                 ( ExceptT Other TypeError\n                  ( WriterT Other [Warning]\n
  \                 ( StateT Fresh FreshNameGenerator\n                  ( IO\n                  )))))\n\nThen,
  instead of using type-level numbers to indicate the depth in a stack, one\nwould
  use the tag to indicate which part of the stack was meant; so one might\nimagine
  writing something like:\n\n    unify :: MonadState Unification UnificationState
  m => Type -> Type -> m ()\n    unify t1 t2 = get @Unification >>= \\us -> ...\n\n
  \   freshName :: MonadState Fresh FreshNameGenerator m => m Name\n    freshName
  = modify @Fresh (...)\n\nConvenient shorthands could be provided by the appropriate
  libraries for\nselecting, say, the `()` tag by default when the stack of interest
  was\nunambiguous about which layer should provide a given effect.\n\nUnlike choosing
  by effect or choosing by effect+type, one need not worry about\ncollisions with
  tags; modules which want to transform an existing monad could\nensure they use fresh
  tags by just making a new data kind.\n\nThis approach has a lot going for it, and
  I'd love to see a competing library\nattempt this. The main drawback is that it
  is all-or-nothing, in that the\nexisting `transformers` transformers do not have
  these tags. By contrast,\n`effect-stack` interoperates smoothly with existing `transformers`
  stacks. This\nmeans that\n\n1. Existing projects can adopt this library without
  a big migration.\n2. New projects can use just `transformers`+`mtl`, which are syntactically
  and\n   conceptually very light, right up to the moment that they need something\n
  \  more complicated.\n"
