  # `effectful-st`

  Version 0.0.0.1

  ## Description

  An [`ST`]-style alternative to the [`Prim`] effect in [`effectful`] that
  allows safely running scoped state transformations without `IOE`.

  The `Prim` effect allows the use of [`PrimMonad`] on `Eff` without
  allowing arbitrary `IO`. However, there is no safe way to run the
  effect without introducing the `IOE` effect because `Prim` has no
  way of delimiting the scope of the mutation to `runPrim`. In other
  words, `Prim` is effectively acting merely as a restricted form of
  `IOE` that only allows `PrimMonad`.

  `STE` from this package on the other hand borrows the quantification
  trick from [`Control.Monad.ST`][`ST`] to provide a safe way to run
  the effect purely.

  This project follows the [Haskell Package Versioning Policy][PVP].
