  # mbug

  ## Rationale

  This program makes working with old Debian bugs much more pleasant.
  Sometimes I want to have personal bug-squashing party, so you open
  [https://bugs.debian.org/kaction@gnu.org] in web-browser, and get nice
  list of bugs that require my attention.

  Browsing is great, but when I want to do something with those bugs --
  close, add tags, discuss, I have to copy bug number, launch mail client
  in another terminal and compose email to [mailto:nnn@bugs.debian.org].

  Should I need to quote some previous message, more distracting actions
  are to be done -- download whole bug as mbox, incorporate that mbox into
  my mail system (I prefer MH), and only after that real work could start.

  DebBugs has also email interface -- you can request sending to you bugs
  you want, but reply is also optimized for reading, not for manipulating.
  Honestly, it looks like corresponding web page, filtered by `lynx`.

  ## Solution

  ~~~~
  mbug [--into <folder>] <query>
  ~~~~

  It will download mbox of every bug, listed at
  `https://bugs.debian.org/<query>` and create `+<folder>` MH folder. In
  that folder subfolder for every bug is created. By default, `<folder>`
  is `debbugs`.

  Folder `+<folder>` is volatile, every new invocation of `mbox` will
  overwrite its previous content. This way you can focus on bugs you are
  interested in right now.
