description: ! "# MBot robot library\n\nWith this library it is possible to control
  the mBot robot from within Haskell over 2.4ghz wireless.\nThe mBot itself needs
  to contain the standard firmware otherwise the library will not behave as expected.
  \nThere is support for steering the motors and leds and for reading the linesensor
  and the ultrasonic sensor.\nAn small example program is shown below, for more information
  about the individual functions take a look at the api documentation below.\n\n```Haskell\nimport
  MBot\n\nmain =  do\n  putStrLn \"My first mBot program in Haskell !\"\n  -- Open
  the connection with the mMbot\n  d <- openMBot\n  putStrLn \"Opened a connection
  with the mBot\"\n  -- Turn on led 1 of the mBot and set the RGB value to (0,100,0)\n
  \ sendCommand d $ setRGB 1 0 100 0\n  putStrLn \"Look at all the pretty colors !\"\n
  \ -- Turn on led 2 of the mBot and set the RGB value to (100,0,0)\n  sendCommand
  d $ setRGB 2 100 0 0 \n  -- close the connection with the mBot \n  closeMBot d\n```\n"
