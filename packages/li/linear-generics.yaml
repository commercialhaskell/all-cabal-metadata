  This package offers a version of
  [`GHC.Generics`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/GHC-Generics.html)
  with two important improvements:

  1. The `to`, `from`, `to1`, and `from1` methods have multiplicity-polymorphic
     types, allowing them to be used with either traditional Haskell code or
     linearly typed code.

  2. The representations used for `Generic1` are modified slightly.

     -  Composition associates to the left in the generic representation. As a result,
        `to1` and `from1` never need to use `fmap`. This can
        [greatly improve performance](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/15969),
        and it is necessary to support multiplicity polymorphism,
        [as discussed here](https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/pull/316).
     - Generic representations no longer use `Rec1 f`, they use `Par1 :.: f` instead,
       [as proposed by spl](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/7492).
       This way you no longer need to write `Rec1` instances for your derivers.

     For more details, see the `Generics.Linear` documentation.

  This library is organized as follows:

  * `Generics.Linear` defines the core functionality for generics,
    including the multiplicity-polymorphic `Generic(1)` classes and
    a replacement for the `:.:` composition type.

  * `Generics.Linear.TH` implements Template Haskell functionality for
    deriving instances of `Generic(1)`.

  * `Generics.Linear.Unsafe.ViaGHCGenerics` offers `DerivingVia` targets to
    derive `Generic` and (some) `Generic1` instances from their
    `GHC.Generics` counterparts. Because these instances necessarily
    use unsafe coercions, their use will likely inhibit full optimization
    of code using them (see
    [this wiki page](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/linear-types/multiplicity-evidence)
    for more on the GHC internals, along with commentary in `Unsafe.Coerce`).

  Educational code: the educational modules exported by
  [`generic-deriving`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-deriving)
  have been copied into the `tests/Generic/Deriving` directory
  in this repository, with the very few modifications required to
  accommodate the differences between the `Generic1` representations
  here and in `base`. All the same caveats apply as in the originals;
  see that package's `README`.
