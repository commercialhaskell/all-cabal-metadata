changelog: |
  # 0.2.2
  * Produce an orderly error message if someone gives us `type data`.
  * Produce an error message much more eagerly when someone tries to
    use `GHCGenerically1` with an improperly shaped type.
  * Place `INLINE [1]` pragmas on `from` and `to` implementations when types
    don't have too many constructors or fields, following the heuristics GHC
    has used for `Generic` deriving since version 9.2.

  # 0.2.1
  * Add a `Generic` instance for `Data.Void.Void`.

  # 0.2
  * The `Generic1` instance for `Generically1` no longer uses
    `GHC.Generics.Generic1`; it now uses `GHC.Generics.Generic` instead.  This
    allows far more instances to be derived.

  # 0.1.0.1
  * Make `Generic1` deriving properly polykinded. There was an old kind check
    that has not been valid for a long time.

  * Improve error handling slightly.

  * Adjust `README`.

  * Refactor code in Generics.Linear.TH

  * Improve comments.
  # 0.1.0.0
  * Initial fork from `generic-deriving`.

  This package offers a version of
  [`GHC.Generics`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/GHC-Generics.html)
  with two important improvements:

  1. The `to`, `from`, `to1`, and `from1` methods have multiplicity-polymorphic
     types, allowing them to be used with either traditional Haskell code or
     linearly typed code.

  2. The representations used for `Generic1` are modified slightly.

     -  Composition associates to the left in the generic representation. As a result,
        `to1` and `from1` never need to use `fmap`. This can
        [greatly improve performance](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/15969),
        and it is necessary to support multiplicity polymorphism,
        [as discussed here](https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/pull/316).
     - Generic representations no longer use `Rec1 f`, they use `Par1 :.: f` instead,
       [as proposed by spl](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/7492).
       This way you no longer need to write `Rec1` instances for your derivers.

     For more details, see the `Generics.Linear` documentation.

  This library is organized as follows:

  * `Generics.Linear` defines the core functionality for generics. This includes:

     - multiplicity polymorphic `Generic` and `Generic1` classes,
     - a replacement for the `:.:` composition type, and
     - an `MP1` type for nonlinear and multiplicity polymorphic fields.

  * `Generics.Linear.TH` implements Template Haskell functionality for
    deriving instances of `Generic(1)`.

  * `Generics.Linear.Unsafe.ViaGHCGenerics` offers `DerivingVia` targets to
    derive both `Generic` and `Generic1` instances from `GHC.Generics.Generic`.
    Because these instances necessarily use unsafe coercions, their
    use will likely inhibit full optimization of code using them (see
    [this wiki page](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/linear-types/multiplicity-evidence)
    for more on the GHC internals, along with commentary in `Unsafe.Coerce`).

  Educational code: the educational modules exported by
  [`generic-deriving`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-deriving)
  have been copied into the `tests/Generic/Deriving` directory
  in this repository, with the very few modifications required to
  accommodate the differences between the `Generic1` representations
  here and in `base`. All the same caveats apply as in the originals;
  see that package's `README`.
