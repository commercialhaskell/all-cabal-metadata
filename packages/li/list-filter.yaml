  # list-filter
  _list-filter_ is a library for more filters than are available in the standard
  libraries

  ## Features
  _list-filter_ is a new project, but the following features have been implemented
  and extensively tested:
    * `takeEvery`, `dropEvery`: Take or drop every nth element
    * `takeUntil`, `dropUntil`: Like `takeWhile`, `dropWhile`, but keep the
      element that satisfies/falsifies the predicate.

  Full documentation can be built with Haddock (see instructions below), and is
  also available on Hackage.

  ## Installation
  Build and install with [Stack](https://www.haskellstack.org):

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/pgujjula/list-utilities
  cd list-utilities/list-filter
  stack build list-filter           # build the project
  stack haddock list-filter --open  # build and view documentation
  stack test                        # run the test suite
  ```
