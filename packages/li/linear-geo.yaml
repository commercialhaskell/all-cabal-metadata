  # linear-geo

  Geographic coordinates, built on the linear package.

  This package provides types and functions for dealing with coordinates in
  geodetic, ECEF, and ENU coordinate systems. A particular emphasis is placed on
  numerical stability, especially for complex conversions like converting between
  geodetic and ECEF coordinates. However, not every part of every function has
  machine checked for numerical stability.
