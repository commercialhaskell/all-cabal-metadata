changelog: |
  0.9.0
  =====

    * Supported lts-19.33 (GHC 9.0.2)

  0.8.4
  =====

    * Supported http-client >= 0.5

  0.8.3
  =====

    * Switched to `Control.Monad.Except`

    * Dropped support for GHC < 7.10

  0.8.2
  =====

    * Stopped using the deprecated stuff in `http-client{,-tls}`

  0.8.1
  =====

    * Supported GHC 7.10

  0.8.0
  =====

    * Dropped `lifted-base` and `lifted-async` dependencies

    * Simplified the Jenkins master node configuration record

    * Added `stream` to provide convenient streaming

    * Removed the support for disconnects, thus simplifying the public API slightly.
      Note that `reload`, `restart`, and `forceRestart` do not disconnect automatically anymore.

  0.7.0
  =====

    * Jenkins' responses to `POST` requests are being read again

    * Added `groovy` to ease the communication with the embedded Groovy
      interpreter (see example/repl.hs)

  0.6.0
  =====

    * Made `orElse` more powerful. The old version is available as `orElse_`

    * Renamed a bunch of things.  The `Jenkins.Rest` module is intended to be imported qualified.

    * Switched to the transformer version of the Church-encoded free monad

    * Removed `getS`. As a side-effect, `get` doesn't leak like crazy anymore

    * Generalized `traverseC_` (again)

    * Removed redundant `jenkinsPort` option: `jenkinsUrl` handles port numbers well enough

    * Reworked API method construction. The new version is safer (it's impossible to forget
      to specify the format of the response), less magical (format is a separate argument to
      the query function), and has fewer corner cases

  0.5.0
  =====

    * Replaced `concurrentlys` and `concurrentlys_` with `traverseC` and `traverseC_`
      respectively. Quick migration guide:

      + `concurrentlys`  -> `traverseC  id . toList`
      + `concurrentlys_` -> `traverseC_ id . toList`

    * Added `getS` for tighter control of Jenkins responses consumption

    * `post` variants do not read the response body at all anymore

    * Added `orElse`

    * Removed `runJenkinsThrowing` from the API

    * `runJenkins` only catches exceptions thrown by the execution of `Jenkins` queries

    * Switched to `network-uri`

    * Removed `io` from the API. Quick migration guide: `io` -> `liftIO`

  0.4.3.0
  =======

    * Upgraded dependencies' bounds

  0.4.2.0
  =======

    * Generalized `ConnectInfo`

  0.4.1.0
  =======

    * Generalized `io`

    * Added `runJenkinsThrowing`

  0.4.0.0
  =======

    * Switched to `Text` for username and API token (password)

    * Supported `lens-4.0`

  0.3.0.0
  =======

    * `restart` does not send requests to `$jenkins_url/restart` anymore. Instead, it calls
    `$jenkins_url/safe-restart` which waits running jobs to complete. New `forceRestart` function
    does now what `restart` did before

    * Massive refactoring

    * More optics in `Network.HTTP.Conduit.Lens`

    * Added `overallLoad` and `computer` REST API methods shortcuts

  0.2.0.0
  =======

    * Moved onto http-conduit 2.0 API.

  0.1.0.0
  =======

    * Initial release. REST and Discovery APIs support.
