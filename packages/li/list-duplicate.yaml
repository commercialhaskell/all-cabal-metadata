  # list-duplicate
  _list-duplicate_ is a library for working with duplicates in lists.

  ## Features
  _list-duplicate_ is a new project, but the following features have been implemented
  and extensively tested:
    * `group`, `groupBy`: Group duplicate elements
    * `groupAdj`, `groupAdj`: Group duplicate adjacent elements in a list. Also
      useful for grouping the elements of a sorted list.
    * `deleteDups`, `deleteDupsBy`: Delete duplicates from a list.
    * `deleteAdjDups`, `deleteAdjDupsBy`: Delete adjacent duplicates from a list.
      Also useful for deleting duplicates from a sorted list.

  Full documentation can be built with Haddock (see instructions below), and is
  also available on Hackage.

  ## Installation
