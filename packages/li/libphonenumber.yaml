description: |-
  This package provides bindings for the C++ version of the
  <https://github.com/google/libphonenumber libphonenumber library>.
  The bindings currently do not include @AsYouTypeFormatter@
  and @ShortNumberInfo@. The C++ library must be of version
  >= 8.7.0.

  The interface largely resembles that of the original unified
  C++, Java, and JavaScript version of the library, with some
  minor changes to make the interface more Haskell-like.

  The provided functions are pure, under the assumption that
  we are the only user of the C++ library, i.e. that no one
  else has installed a global logger which could observe
  side-effects from library calls.

  The underlying library internally uses UTF-8 encoded byte
  strings. To avoid decoding overhead where it is unnecessary,
  and to avoid a dependency on @text@, we use 'ByteString'
  throughout the library instead of 'Data.Text.Text'.
