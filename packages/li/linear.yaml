changelog: |
  1.20.9 [2019.05.02]
  -------------------
  * Derive `Lift` instances for `Plucker`, `Quaternion`, and `V{0,1,2,3,4}`.

  1.20.8 [2018.07.03]
  -------------------
  * Add instances of the `Field` classes from `lens`.
  * Add `Epsilon` instance for `Complex`.
  * Use specialized implementations of the `null` and `length` methods in
    `Foldable` instances.
  * Add `Hashable1` instances for data types in `linear`. Also add a
    `Hashable` instance for `V`.
  * Fix a bug in which `Quaternion`s were incorrectly exponentiated.

  1.20.7
  ------
  * Support `semigroupoids-5.2.1` and `doctest-0.12`

  1.20.6
  ------
  * Revamp `Setup.hs` to use `cabal-doctest`. This makes it build
    with `Cabal-2.0`, and makes the `doctest`s work with `cabal new-build` and
    sandboxes.
  * Make `(1 / x)` and `recip x` agree in the `Fractional` instance for `Quaternion`
  * Use newtype instances for `Point` vectors in `Linear.Affine`
  * Enable `PolyKinds` in `Linear.Trace`. Also enable `PolyKinds` when GHC 7.6 or
    later is used (previously, it was GHC 7.8 or later).
  * Fix a segfault arising from the `MVector` instance for `V`
  * Add `Finite` class for conversion between `V` and fixed-size vector types

  1.20.5
  ------
  * GHC 8 compatibility
  * Fixed the `perspective` calculation.

  1.20.4
  ------
  * Compatibility with `base-orphans` 0.5

  1.20.3
  ------
  * Support `vector` 0.11.0.0.
  * Support `cereal` 0.5
  * You can now unboxed vectors of `V n` vectors.

  1.20.2
  ------
  * Modified the `doctest` machinery to work with `stack` and builds to non-standard locations.
  * Removed the local `.ghci` file.
  * Various numerical stability improvements were made to the quaternion and projection functions.

  1.20.1
  ------
  * Fixed doctests broken by the previous change.
  * Unboxed vector instances for various linear data types now use unpacked integers even on older GHCs.

  1.20
  ----
  * `inv22`, `inv33` and `inv44` no longer attempt an epsilon check. They no longer return a `Maybe` result as a consequence.
    You should filter for the 0 determinant case yourself.

  1.19.1.3
  --------
  * `vector` 0.11.0.0 support

  1.19.1.2
  --------
  * Fix GHC 7.4.

  1.19.1.1
  --------
  * Proper `reflection` 2 support

  1.19.1
  ------
  * `reflection` 2 support

  1.19
  ----
  * Change the Ixed instance for `Linear.V` to use `Int` as the index type. This makes `V n` a _lot_ easier to use.

  1.18.3
  ------
  * Compile warning-free on GHC 7.10.


  1.18.2
  ------
  * Added `NFData` instance for `Point`

  1.18.1
  ------
  * Added an `-f-template-haskell` option to allow disabling `template-haskell` support. This is an unsupported configuration but may be useful for expert users in sandbox configurations.
  * Added lenses for extracting corner various sub-matrices e.g. `_m22`, `_m33`

  1.18.0.2
  --------
  * Fixed builds on even older GHCs.

  1.18.0.1
  --------
  * Fixed the test suite.
  * Fixed builds on older GHCs.

  1.18
  ----
  * Consolidated `eye2` .. `eye4` into a single `identity` combinator.
  * Fixed the `Data` instance `V n a` for GHC 7.10-RC3.

  1.17.1.1
  --------
  * `filepath` 1.4 support

  1.17.1
  ------
  * Added support for `Data.Functor.Classes` from `transformers` 0.5 via `transformers-compat`.
  * Added missing support for `binary`, `bytes` and `cereal` for `Point`

  1.17
  ----
  * Better support for `binary`. Added support for `bytes` and `cereal`

  1.16.4
  ------
  * `ortho` and `inverseOrtho` now only require a `Fractional` constraint.
  * Added missing `Floating` instances.

  1.16.3
  ----
  * Improve the performance of `fromQuaternion`, `mkTransformation`,
    `mkTransformationMat`, `basisFor`, `scaled` by using implementations
    that inline well for functions that were previously reference
    implementations.

  1.16.2
  ----
  * Added `NFData` instances for the various vector types.
  * Added `!!/` operator for matrix division by scalar.

  1.16.1
  ----
  * Added `Trace` instance for `V1`.

  1.16
  ----
  * Renamed `kronecker` to `scaled`.

  1.15.5
  ------
  * Added `Metric` instances for `[]`, `ZipList`, `Maybe`
  * Added `det44` and `inv44` to `Linear.Matrix`
  * Added `Data` instance for `Point`

  1.15.4
  ------
  * Added Typeable and Data instances for V

  1.15.3
  ------
  * Added missing `FunctorWithIndex`, `FoldableWithIndex` and `TraversableWithIndex Int (V n)` instances for `V`

  1.15.2
  ------
  * Added `frustum`, analogous to the old `glFrustum` call.
  * Added `inverseInfinitePerspective`, `inverseOrtho`, `inverseFrustum`.

  1.15.1
  ------
  * Added `inversePerspective`. It is much more accurate to compute it directly than to compute an inverse.

  1.15.0.1
  --------
  * Fixed build failures caused by `Linear` re-exporting the old name.

  1.15
  ----
  * Renamed `Linear.Perspective` to `Linear.Projection`.
  * Fixed a build issue with GHC HEAD.

  1.14.0.1
  --------
  * Fixed test failures caused by 1.14

  1.14
  ----
  * Moved `Coincides` to `Linear.Plucker.Coincides`. The constructors `Line` and `Ray` oft collided with user code.

  1.13
  ----
  * Switched 'ortho' to follow the OpenGL handedness.

  1.12.1
  ------
  * Added "swizzle" lenses **e.g.** `_yzx`, which are useful for working with libraries like `gl`.

  1.12
  ------
  * Added 'transpose'
  * Added missing 'Mxy' matrices up to 4 dimensions -- they were commonly reimplemented by users.

  1.11.3
  ------
  * Fixed an issue with `UndecidableInstances` on GHC 7.6.3

  1.11.2
  ------
  * Added `Linear.Perspective`.

  1.11.1
  ------
  * Added `_Point`, `relative` and a few instances for `Point`.

  1.11
  ----
  * Changed the 'representation' of `V n` from `E (V n)`, which was hard to use, to `Int`, which is a bit too permissive, but is easy to use.

  1.10.1
  ------
  * Added `Linear.V2.angle`.

  1.10
  ----
  * Added `Hashable` instances.

  1.9.1
  -----
  * Added a role annotation to `V n a` to prevent users from using GHC 7.8's `Coercible` machinery to violate invariants.

  1.9.0.1
  -----
  * Fixed a broken build

  1.9
  ---
  * Added `MonadZip` instances.
  * Added `MonadFix` instances.

  1.8
  ---
  * Added missing `Unbox` instances for working with unboxed vectors of `linear` data types.

  ---

  * `unit` now has a rank 1 type.

  1.5
  ---

  1.1.2
  -----
  * Dependency bump for `reflection` compatibility

  1.1.1
  -----
  * Fixed an infinite loop in the default definition of `liftI2`.
