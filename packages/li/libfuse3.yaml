  # libfuse3: A Haskell binding to libfuse-3.x

  ![GitHub Actions](https://github.com/matil019/haskell-libfuse3/workflows/Haskell%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

  ## Important notes

  - Executables using `libfuse3` should be compiled with the threaded runtime (`-threaded`).
  - Developed and tested on Linux only. Not tested on other UNIXes such as BSD and MacOS because I don't own them / machines to run them on.

  ## System dependencies

  This package depends on the C library [libfuse][libfuse] and `pkg-config`. Please install them with your system package manager before building this package. For example, on Ubuntu:

  ```sh
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libfuse3-dev fuse3 pkg-config
  ```

  **NOTE:** `libfuse3-dev` is not available until Ubuntu-20.04 (a.k.a. "focal").

  **NOTE2:** Not to be confused with `libfuse-dev` (whose version is 2.x). It can coexist with `libfuse3-dev`, but it is incompatible with this package.

  ## Building from HEAD

  This packages uses the `./configure` script, but it is not checked into the git repository. To build the source checked out from git, you must generate it from `configure.ac` before invoking any of the `cabal` commands:

  ```
  autoreconf -fiv
  # cabal v2-build, etc.
  ```

  You may have to install `autotools` or something like that with your system package manager.

  ## Examples

  There are two examples, `null` and `passthrough` in the `example` directory. These are the ports of the examples in the official libfuse. They should be good start points for writing your filesystems.

  Enable the cabal flag to build them:

  ```
  cabal v2-configure --flags=examples
  ```

  ## Known issues and limitations

  - A signal needs to be sent twice to stop the process and unmount the filesystem.
    - This means you have to run `kill -2 <pid>` twice or hit `Ctrl-C` twice (if running in foreground).
    - On the other hand, `fusermount3 -u` can unmount the filesystem on the first attempt.
  - Not all Haskell-friendly bindings to the FUSE operations are implemented yet, including but not limited to:
    - `struct fuse_conn_info`. The availability of filesystem capabilities such as `FUSE_CAP_HANDLE_KILLPRIV` can't be checked.
    - Setting the fields of `struct fuse_file_info` from the certain fuse operations.
  - Look for the `TODO` comments in the source tree for more specific topics.

  If you are able to fix/implement any of these, that would be very appreciated! Please open a PR to contribute.

  ## Related works

  - [libfuse][libfuse]: The reference implementation, to which this package binds
  - [HFuse][HFuse]: The bindings to libfuse-2.x
    - `libfuse3` is based on `HFuse` (with massive rewrites).
    - `libfuse3` has more complete API and exposes internal (and unstable) API to allow workarounds.
  - [fuse-rs][fuse-rs]: The Rust implementation of FUSE. Unlike this package, `fuse-rs` implements the FUSE protocol itself, mostly reimplementing `libfuse` in Rust. See [its README](https://github.com/zargony/fuse-rs) for overview.
