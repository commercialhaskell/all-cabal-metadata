  # Revision history for libBF-hs

  ## 0.6.6 -- 2023.07.17

  * Update the vendored version of `libbf` to include the changes from the
    `2021-03-27` version of `libbf` included in `quickjs`. This includes a bugfix
    that prevents the `bfIsSubnormal` function from infinitely looping on AArch64
    (and other non-x86 64-bit architectures) on certain inputs.

  ## 0.6.5.1 -- 2022.08.29

  * Fix a build error on non-Windows OSes accidentally introduced in version
    0.6.5.

  ## 0.6.5 -- 2022.08.29

  * Force static linking against `gcc_s` on Windows to avoid portability issues.

  ## 0.6.4 -- 2022.08.11

  * Fix the build on Windows with GHC 9.4, which bundles a Clang-based C
    toolchain instead of a GCC-based one.

  ## 0.6.3 -- 2021-10-14

  * Fix an additional compile issue on 32-bit systems. Previously
  the argument to fmul2Exp was incorrectly specified as an `Int64`.

  ## 0.6.2 -- 2021-02-19

  * Fix a bug related to incorrect marshalling of String to C in
    `setString` and `bfFromString`.

  ## 0.6.1 -- 2021-02-16

  * Fix a linker issue on Windows when loading via the GHC dynamic linker.

  ## 0.6 -- 2021-01-29

  * Fix a bug with `frint` and `bfRoundInt` that was causing incorrect
  rounding modes to be selected.

  * Implement additional operations on `BigFloat` values, including
  some missing predicates, conversions to and from binary form
  and fused-multiply-add.

  * Fix a compile issue on 32-bit systems.

  ## 0.5.2 -- 2021-01-12

  * Use `install-includes` over `c-sources` for header files to avoid linker
  issues.

  ## 0.5.1 -- 2020-07-13

  * Add header files to `c-sources` field to include them in `sdist`.

  ## 0.5.0 -- 2020-07-01

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.
