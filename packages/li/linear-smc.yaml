description: |-
  A number of domain specific languages, such as circuits or
  data-science workflows, are best expressed as diagrams of boxes
  connected by wires.
  A faithful abstraction of box-and-wires is Symmetric Monoidal Categories (SMCs)
  This library
  allows one to program SMCs with linear functions instead of SMC
  combinators. This is done without resorting to template haskell or compiler plugins.
  The rationale, design and implementation of this library is provided by the paper  "Evaluating Linear Functions to Symmetric Monoidal Categories", by Jean-Philippe Bernardy and Arnaud Spiwack, appearing at Haskell Symposium 2021.
