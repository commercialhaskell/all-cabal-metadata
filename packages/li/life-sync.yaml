  `life-sync` is a CLI tool that makes it easier to synchronize a repository of
  personal config files across multiple machines.

  ## Motivation

  You might have some configuration files with different settings for your system.
  For example:

  1. Preferred settings for your editors (Spacemacs, Vim, etc.).
  2. Useful bash aliases and other miscellaneous shell settings.
  3. Git configuration.

  And much more! But sometimes you start working from a fresh machine without
  having your settings within reach, as in these situations:

  1. You bought a new PC or laptop.
  2. You reinstalled the operating system on your machine.
  3. You were given a new laptop at work.

  Every time this happens, you need to walk through the tedious process of copying
  your data again. It's a well-known practice to
  [store configs in a `dotfiles` GitHub repository](https://dotfiles.github.io/).
  And `life-sync` makes it much easier to maintain this repository! With a single
  command, your can copy every file and directory from your `dotfiles` repository to
  your machine. Or update your remote `dotfiles` repository after multiple local
  changes to different files.

  ## Prerequisites

  * [`git`](https://git-scm.com)
  * [`hub`](https://github.com/github/hub)
  * SSH access to Github configured

  ## Installation

  There are several ways to install `life` on your machine.
  Here are detailed instructions on different approaches.

  ### From Hackage/Stackage

  Install with one simple command:

  ```shell
  $ cabal install life-sync
  ```

  or

  ```shell
  $ stack install life-sync
  ```

  ### Homebrew

  If you are on MacOS, you can get `life-sync` using
  [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) Kowainik's Tap.

  You need to run the following commands for that:

  ```shell
  $ brew tap kowainik/tap
  $ brew install life-sync
  ```

  ### Ubuntu

  If you are on Ubuntu, you can get `life-sync` from Kowainik's PPA.

  You need to run the following commands for that:

  ```shell
  $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kowainik/life-sync
  $ sudo apt update
  $ sudo apt install life-sync
  ```

  ### Setup

  You can turn on bash auto-completion by running the following command:

  ```
  $ source <(life --bash-completion-script `which life`)
  ```

  ## Usage

  After installing `life-sync` you need to call the command `life` with specified options:

  ```
  $ life --help
  Usage: life COMMAND
    life-sync synchronize your personal configs

  Available options:
    -h,--help                Show this help text

  Available commands:
    init                     Initialize GitHub repository named 'dotfiles' if you
                             don't have one.
    add                      Add file or directory to the life configuration.
    remove                   Remove file or directory from the life configuration.
    push                     Updates GitHub repository from local state and push
                             the latest version.
    pull                     Updates local state of '.life' and 'dotfiles' from
                             GitHub repository.

  `life init` usage: life init OWNER
    OWNER                    Your github user name

  `life add` usage: life add ((-f|--file FILE_PATH) | (-d|--dir DIRECTORY_PATH))
    -f,--file FILE_PATH      File to add
    -d,--dir FILE_PATH       Directory to add

  `life remove` usage: life remove ((-f|--file FILE_PATH) | (-d|--dir DIRECTORY_PATH))
    -f,--file FILE_PATH      File to remove
    -d,--dir FILE_PATH       Directory to remote

  `life push` usage: life push

  `life pull` usage: life pull OWNER [-f|--no-file FILE_PATH] [-d|--no-dir FILE_PATH]
    OWNER                    Your github user name
    -f,--no-file FILE_PATH   Excluding these specific files from copying
    -d,--no-dir FILE_PATH    Excluding these specific directories from copying

  ```

  > **NOTE:** If a command takes a path to a file or a directory as an
  > argument, the path should be specifed relative to the home directory.

  `life-sync` keeps the structure of your `dotfiles` repository in its own file
  called `.life` which is also stored in your `dotfiles` repository.

  You can see an example of a `dotfiles` repository maintained by `life-sync` here:

  * [ChShersh/dotfiles](https://github.com/ChShersh/dotfiles)

  ## Examples

  ### Create a `dotfiles` repository for the first time

  ```
  $ life init MyGithubName
  ```

  ### Track a new file or directory

  To track a file:

  ```
  $ life add -f path/to/file/relative/from/home
  ```

  To track a directory:

  ```
  $ life add -d path/to/dir/relative/from/home
  ```

  To stop tracking some file, use `life remove` instead.

  ### Push all changes to the remote repository

  ```
  $ life push
  ```

  ### Pull all changes from the remote repository

  To pull every file and directory:

  ```
  $ life pull ChShersh
  ```

  To pull everything except some files or some directories:

  ```
  $ life pull ChShersh --no-file some/file --no-dir some/dir
  ```
