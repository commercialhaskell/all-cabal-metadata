  is a CLI tool that makes it easier to synchronize `dotfiles`\nrepository with personal
  configs across multiple machines.\n\n## Motivation\n\nYou might have some configuration
  files with different settings for your system.\nFor example:\n\n1. Preferred settings
  for your editors (Spacemacs, Vim, etc.).\n2. Useful bash aliases and other miscellaneous
  shell settings.\n3. Git configuration.\n\nAnd much more! But sometimes you start
  working from a new fresh machine without\nhaving your settings within touch, like
  in these situations:\n\n1. You bought a new PC or laptop.\n2. You might reinstall
  your system on your working machine.\n3. You were given a new laptop at work.\n\nEvery
  time this happens, you need to walk through the tedious process of copying\nyour
  data again. It's a well-known practice to\n[store configs in `dotfiles` GitHub repository](https://dotfiles.github.io/).\nAnd
  `life-sync` makes it much easier to maintain this repository! With a single\ncommand,
  your can copy every file and directory from `dotfiles` repository to\nyour machine.
  Or update your remote `dotfiles` repository after multiple local\nchanges to different
  files.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstallation process can be done with one simple command:\n\n```shell\n$
  cabal install life-sync\n```\n\nor\n\n```shell\n$ stack install life-sync-1.0\n```\n\nYou
  can turn on the bash auto-completion by running the following command:\n\n```\n$
  source <(life --bash-completion-script `which life`)\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n> **NOTE:**
  make sure you configured SSH for your Github. `life-sync` assumes\n> that you have
  SSH configured.\n\nAfter installing `life-sync` you need to call command `life`
  with specified options:\n\n```\n$ life --help\nUsage: life COMMAND\n  life-sync
  synchronize your personal configs\n\nAvailable options:\n  -h,--help                Show
  this help text\n\nAvailable commands:\n  init                     Initialize GitHub
  repository named 'dotfiles' if you\n                           don't have one.\n
  \ add                      Add file or directory to the life configuration.\n  remove
  \                  Remove file or directory from the life configuration.\n  push
  \                    Updates GitHub repository from local state and push\n                           the
  latest version.\n  pull                     Updates local state of '.life' and 'dotfiles'
  from\n                           GitHub repository.\n\n`life init` usage: life init
  OWNER\n  OWNER                    Your github user name\n\n`life add` usage: life
  add ((-f|--file FILE_PATH) | (-d|--dir DIRECTORY_PATH))\n  -f,--file FILE_PATH      File
  to add\n  -d,--dir FILE_PATH       Directory to add\n\n`life remove` usage: life
  remove ((-f|--file FILE_PATH) | (-d|--dir DIRECTORY_PATH))\n  -f,--file FILE_PATH
  \     File to remove\n  -d,--dir FILE_PATH       Directory to remote\n\n`life push`
  usage: life push\n\n`life pull` usage: life pull OWNER [-f|--no-file FILE_PATH]
  [-d|--no-dir FILE_PATH]\n  OWNER                    Your github user name\n  -f,--no-file
  FILE_PATH   Excluding these specific files from copying\n  -d,--no-dir FILE_PATH
  \   Excluding these specific directories from copying\n\n```\n\n> **NOTE:** If some
  command takes a path to a file or a directory as an\n> argument, the path should
  be specifed relative to the home directory.\n\n`life-sync` keeps the structure of
  your `dotfiles` repository in its own file\ncalled `.life` which is stored in `dotfiles`
  repository as well.\n\nYou can see an example of `dotfiles` repository maintained
  by `life-sync` here:\n\n* [ChShersh/dotfiles](https://github.com/ChShersh/dotfiles)\n\n##
  Examples\n\n### Create `dotfiles` repository for the first time\n\n```\n$ life init
  MyGithubName\n```\n\n### Track new file or directory\n\nTo track a file:\n\n```\n$
  life add -f path/to/file/relative/from/home\n```\n\nTo track a directory:\n\n```\n$
  life add -d path/to/dir/relative/from/home\n```\n\nTo stop tracking some file, use
  `life remove` command instead.\n\n### Push all changes to remote repository\n\n```\n$
  life push\n```\n\n### Pull all changes from remote repository\n\nTo pull every file
  and directory:\n\n```\n$ life pull ChShersh\n```\n\nTo pull everything except some
  files or some directories:\n\n```\n$ life pull ChShersh --no-file some/file --no-dir
  some/dir\n```\n"
