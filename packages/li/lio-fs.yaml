description: |-
  A very simple file system interface for LIO. Labels are associated
  with files and directories in the form of extended attributes.  This
  library exposes a simple API for on files and directories that
  abides by information flow control: a label on the file protects its
  contents, while a directory label protects the containing files'
  attributes (names and labels).

  See "LIO.FS.TCB" for a description of the filestore implementation
  and "LIO.FS.Simple" for a description of the actual API.

  This library is still under development, use with care.
