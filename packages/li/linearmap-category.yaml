description: |-
  The term /numerical linear algebra/ is often used almost
  synonymous with /matrix modifications/. However, what's interesting
  for most applications are really just /points in some vector space/
  and linear mappings between them, not matrices (which represent
  points or mappings, but inherently depend on a particular choice
  of basis / coordinate system).

  This library implements the crucial LA operations like solving
  linear equations and eigenvalue problems, without requiring
  that the vectors are represented in some particular basis.
  This appoach offers:
  1. conceptual elegance (only operations that are actually
  geometrically sensible will typecheck – this is far stronger than
  just confirming that the dimensions match, as some other libraries
  do)
  2. opportunity to type tensors more expressively. E.g. instead of
  having a tensor with many dimensions that can easily be confused,
  one can have e.g. a space of images and take the tensor product
  with a linear batch space, etc..
  3. it opens up optimisation possibilities: the vectors can be
  unboxed, use dedicated sparse compression, possibly carry out the
  computations on accelerated hardware (GPU etc.). The spaces can in
  principle even be infinite-dimensional (e.g. function spaces).

  The linear algebra algorithms in this package only require the
  vectors to support fundamental operations like addition, scalar
  products, double-dual-space coercion and tensor products. These
  are expressed by a hierarchy of type classes, none of which requires
  a basis representation.
  Basis representations are optional to allow storage in matrix-based
  backends, but this too is done in a way that allows e.g. taking the
  tensor product of a lazy function space with a static-dimensional
  matrix space with a low-dimensional channels space, and then only
  the inner dimensions will be stored in a packed format.
