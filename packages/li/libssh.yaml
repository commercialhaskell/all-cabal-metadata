  Haskell bindings to the libssh library

  The bindings are not complete (though maybe will get there): they are
  composed primarily to fetch files over SFTP, since other available
  options had issues with that. In particular, when downloading hundreds
  of files per hour, over hundreds of connections (with dozens of those
  simultaneously), in a long-running process, the following was
  observed:

  - SSHFS 2.8 quits without leaving a trace, and does not seem to be
    actively maintained.

  - Haskell curl bindings lead to memory leaks, possibly because curl
    uses libssh2, which leaks (see below).

  - libssh2 1.7.0 (on Debian 9) and 1.9.0 (on Debian 11) appears to leak
    memory, even after leaks in its Haskell bindings are fixed.

  - libssh 0.7.3 (on Debian 9) seems to enter an infinite loop in
    sftp_open occasionally, with high CPU load, but version 0.9.8 (on
    Debian 11) does not.


  The "discarded-qualifiers" warnings happen during the build because of
  the GHC issue 22043, but ConstPtr was introduced recently, so using it
  would break compatibility with base versions that are still in use.

  The bindings are compatible with libssh versions 0.7.3, 0.9.8, 0.10.6.
