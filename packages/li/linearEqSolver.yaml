  * Hackage: <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/linearEqSolver>
  * GitHub:  <http://github.com/LeventErkok/linearEqSolver>

  * Latest Hackage released version: 2.1

  ### Version 2.1, 2019-5-13
    * Update to compile with more recent versions of SBV. Thanks to
      Colin McKibben for reporting the breakage.

  ### Version 2.0, 2017-10-25

    * Use defaultSMTConfig exported from SBV
    * All-solution variants now take the max-number of solutions requested,
      following the corresponding changes in SBV itself. Thanks to Mitchell Rosen
      for reporting.

  ### Version 1.3, 2014-08-27

    * Use the Solver type from SBV directly for picking the solver, avoiding bit-rot.
    * Adjust SBV dependency to >= 3.1, to get proper access to Solver type

  ### Version 1.2, 2013-01-02

    * Allow both CVC4 and Z3 to be used as the SMT solver.
    * Adjust SBV dependency to >= 2.9, to get access to CVC4.

  ### Version 1.1, 2012-10-22

    * Add solvers over rationals, in addition to just integers.
    * Adjust SBV dependency to >= 2.7 as we depend on the new Real
      instance for the AlgReal type.

  ### Version 1.0, 2012-10-18

    * Initial release, contains solver for integer linear equations.

  ## linearEqSolver

  Solve systems of linear equations, using SMT solvers. Both integer only solutions and solutions
  over rationals are supported. Either single solutions, or all solutions can be computed. See the inline
  comments in the haddock documentation for example use cases.
