  # libmdbx-hs

  A [libmdbx](https://github.com/erthink/libmdbx) wrapper, providing low level
  access to its API plus a set of high level functions for common operations.

  Excerpt from libmdbx's [documentation](https://github.com/erthink/libmdbx):

  _**libmdbx** is an extremely fast, compact, powerful, embedded,
  transactional [key-value database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key-value_database),
  with [permissive license](./LICENSE)._

  _Historically, **libmdbx** is a deeply revised and extended descendant of the amazing
  [Lightning Memory-Mapped Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Memory-Mapped_Database).
  **libmdbx** inherits all benefits from _LMDB_, but resolves some issues and adds [a set of improvements](#improvements-beyond-lmdb)._

  ## Usage

  ### Low level interface

  Using libmdbx low level interface involves the following steps:

  - Opening an environment. This is the equivalent of a database.
  - Opening a database. This is the equivalent of a table.
  - Creating a transaction.
  - Performing CRUD operations/using a cursor.
  - Committing or aborting the transaction.

  You can check [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/libmdbx-hs/Mdbx-API.html)
  for the low level interface or [libmdbx](https://erthink.github.io/libmdbx)
  documentation for more details on internals.

  ### High level interface

  Alternatively you can use the higher level interface which, although it provides
  a more limited set of operations, takes care of transaction handling and makes
  the common use cases really simple.

  For the high level interface check [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/libmdbx-hs/Mdbx-Database.html)
  or the sample application [here](app/Main.hs).

  ### Common

  In both scenarios, you will want to check [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/libmdbx-hs/Mdbx-Types.html)
  for information on how to make your data types compatible with libmdbx-hs.
