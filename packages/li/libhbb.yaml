changelog: |2

  Version 0.4.1.0
  ---------------
   - Adding support for inlining value bindings with guards or *where*
     expressions. If such a value bindings is encountered, a trivial *case*
     expression is added `case () of () | ..."`.
   - Fixing a bug that prevented functions with one match and a single parameter
     to be inlined correctly. In this case a prefix like `\a case a of` has been
     produced, which is invalid as `->` is missing.

  Version 0.4.0.2
  ---------------

   - Fixing a bug in the modes *inline* and *smart-inline* which caused them to
     produce a wrong representation for small functions that have no leading case
     expression. The parameters of these function were always aggregated to
     tuples.
   - Adding CHANGELOG.md and README.md to cabal package.

  Version 0.4.0.1
  ---------------

   - The modes *locate*, *inline* and *smart-inline* are now able to
     inline/locate functions that are defined in infix notation.

  Version 0.4.0.0
  ----------------

   - Added the integration mode *apply-ttree*.
   - The modes *inline* and *smart-inline* are now able converting a *where*
     expression to a *let* expression if this makes it possible to omit a leading
     *case* expression. The result is a much shorter lambda function.

  # **hbb**: Extraordinary Haskell programming

  This project aims to create a tool which should be easily embeddable in text
  editors to assist them to provide extraordinary editing features for the
  Haskell programming language. To archieve this, the tool is based on the
  library of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC).

  The name **hbb** is short for *h*askell *b*usy *b*ee and should remind one of
  the programmers using it. It consists of the library *hbb* and a command line
  tool which has the name *libhbb-cli*. *libhbb-cli* has been chosen because in
  another repository the features of (the library) *hbb* and *ghc-mod* are merged
  into an executable *hbb* which provides (many more) features than *libhbb-cli*.

  One outstanding feature of *hbb* is is the possibility to inline a function
  binding.
