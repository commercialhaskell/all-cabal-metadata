changelog: |
  # Version 1.0.18.3

  * Allocation tools such as `crypto_aead_aes256gcm_state'malloc` now
    automatically zero the allocated memory once it becomes unreachable.

  * The constructors for types such as `Crypto_aead_aes256gcm_state` are
    now exported.

  * Export `sodium_memzero'finalizerEnvFree` and `sodium_memzero'finalizerEnv`.

  * Export type-level constants with the memory alignments for state types.

  * Cabal will now avoid trying to install `c2hs` if it has already been
    installed by other means.


  # Version 1.0.18.2

  * Add missing dependency on `c2hs`.

  * Add missing function: `sodium_free`.


  # Version 1.0.18.1

  * Improve support for opaque C structs (`Storable`, `Ptr`, allocation).


  # Version 1.0.18.0

  * Initial version.
