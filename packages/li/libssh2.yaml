description: ! 'This package provides FFI bindings for SSH2 client library named libssh2.


  As of version 0.2 all blocking is handled in Haskell code

  rather than in C code. This means that all calls are now

  interruptable using Haskell asynchronous exceptions; for

  instance, it is now possible to use "System.Timeout" in

  combination with "libssh2".


  /Note on usage on Windows/: On Windows you MUST compile

  your executable with @-threaded@ or ''libssh2'' will NOT

  work. We have tested ''libssh2'' on Windows using

  <http://mingw.org/>, with <http://www.openssl.org/> and

  <http://libssh2.org/> compiled from source (be sure to pass

  the ''shared'' option to the configure script for ''openssl''

  to enable the shared libraries).'
