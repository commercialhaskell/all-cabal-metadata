  This package provides FFI bindings for SSH2 client library named libssh2.

  As of version 0.2 all blocking is handled in Haskell code
  rather than in C code. This means that all calls are now
  interruptable using Haskell asynchronous exceptions; for
  instance, it is now possible to use "System.Timeout" in
  combination with "libssh2".

  /Note on usage on Windows/: On Windows you MUST compile
  your executable with @-threaded@ or 'libssh2' will NOT
  work. We have tested 'libssh2' on Windows using
  <http://mingw.org/>, with <http://www.openssl.org/> and
  <http://libssh2.org/> compiled from source (be sure to pass
  the 'shared' option to the configure script for 'openssl'
  to enable the shared libraries).
