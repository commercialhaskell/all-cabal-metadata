changelog: |
  * v0.9.10
      - Port it for newer network library

  * v0.9.0, 2014-09-21
      - New commands: `deleteRange`, `moveRange`, `playlistInfoRange`,

      - New applicative interface which allows combining arbitrary commands
        into command lists (sol).

      - `MonadMPD.getHandle` has been removed
      - Re-connect and retry on `ResourceVanished` (e.g., when the
        connection times out).

  * v0.8.0, 2012-04-21
      - Use bytestring for wire communication (sol)
      - Increased type safety (sol)
      - Improved memory usage (sol)
      - `lsinfo` supports playlists (nandykins)

  # libmpd-haskell: a client library for MPD

  [![Hackage](https://budueba.com/hackage/libmpd)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/libmpd)
  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/vimus/libmpd-haskell.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/vimus/libmpd-haskell)

  ## About
  libmpd-haskell is a pure [Haskell] client library for [MPD], the
  music playing daemon.

  [MPD]: http://www.musicpd.org
  [Haskell]: http://www.haskell.org

  ## Getting
  * [Latest release on Hackage]
  * `git clone git://github.com/vimus/libmpd-haskell.git`

  [Latest release on Hackage]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/libmpd "libmpd-haskell on Hackage"

  ## Installation
  With [cabal-install], do

  `cd libmpd-haskell && cabal install`

  [cabal-install]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-install

  ## Usage
  With GHCi:

      > :set -XOverloadedStrings
      > import Network.MPD
      > withMPD $ lsInfo ""
      Right [LsDirectory "Tool", LsDirectory "Tom Waits",...]
      > withMPD $ add "Tom Waits/Big Time"
      Right ["Tom Waits/Big Time/01 - 16 Shells from a Thirty-Ought-Six.mp3",...]

  ## MPD API compliance
  Any deviation from the latest version of the [MPD protocol reference]
  is a bug.

  ## Submitting bug reports
  See our [bug tracker]. Test cases are highly appreciated.

  ## Submitting patches
  To submit a patch, use `git format-patch` and email the resulting file(s) to
  one of the developers or upload it to the [bug tracker].

  Alternatively you can create your own fork of the [GitHub repository] and
  send a pull request.

  Well-formatted patches are appreciated. New features should have a test case.
