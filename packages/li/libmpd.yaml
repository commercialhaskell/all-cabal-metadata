synopsis: An MPD client library.
changelog: ! "* v0.9.0, 2014-09-21\n    - New commands: `deleteRange`, `moveRange`,
  `playlistInfoRange`,\n      `searchAdd`, `searchAddpl`.\n    - Fix `playlistId`
  and `list`\n    - Add Mixramp commands\n    - Support for MPD 0.17\n    - Support
  for missing metadata keys.\n    - Sticker idle events\n    - Subscription and message
  events\n    - New applicative interface which allows combining arbitrary commands\n
  \     into command lists (sol).\n    - Consistent typing for song positions (sol).\n
  \   - Command definitions closer to the MPD spec; compound commands\n      have
  been moved to `N.M.C.Extensions`.\n    - `Status.{stUpdatingDb,stTime,stBitrate,stVolume`
  are now `Maybe`\n    - `MonadMPD.getHandle` has been removed\n    - Re-connect and
  retry on `ResourceVanished` (e.g., when the\n      connection times out).\n\n* v0.8.0,
  2012-04-21\n    - Use bytestring for wire communication (sol)\n    - Increased type
  safety (sol)\n    - Improved memory usage (sol)\n    - `lsinfo` supports playlists
  (nandykins)\n    - `idle` now takes a list of subsystems (sol)\n    - `currentSong`
  works when playback is stopped (sol)\n    - Fixes failure on songs without associated
  paths (sol)\n    - `LsResult` replaces `EntryType` (nandykins)\n    - hspec based
  testing added to the test-suite\n    - More extensive parser testing\n    - `MPDError`
  now has an `Exception` instance\n    - Lower bound on Cabal bumped to 1.10\n\n*
  v0.7.2, 2012-02-13\n    - Release connections. Reported by Kanisterschleife on GitHub.\n
  \   - Some minor internal changes (sol)\n\n* v0.7.1, 2012-02-07\n    - Compatible
  with GHC 7.4.1\n\n* v0.7.0, 2011-11-22\n    - Several fixes to the test harness
  (Simon Hengel)\n    - Fixed issue with the (<$>) operator (Simon Hengel)\n    -
  Type safe handling of song IDs (Simon Hengel)\n    - Check MPD version on connect
  (now depends on MPD >= 0.15) (Simon Hengel)\n    - Compatibility with GHC 7.2 (Daniel
  Wagner)\n\n* v0.6.0, 2011-04-01\n    - Reverted some changes from 0.5.0 that caused
  problems,\n      most notably the parser improvements have been removed for now.\n
  \   - Support for GHC 7\n    - Removed support for building against the deprecated
  base 3 package\n    - Added an `Enum` instance for `Metadata`\n    - Removed the
  `old_base` flag\n\n* v0.5.0, 2010-09-08\n    - Moved extensions to Network.MPD.Commands.Extensions\n
  \     These might be removed in a later version\n    - Non-blocking `idle`\n    -
  The API is closer to the MPD spec, by untangling functionality\n    - Better MPD
  API coverage\n    - Improved parser implementation, now runs in constant space\n
  \   - Constructors of the `Subsystem` type have been renamed\n    - Passwords can
  be changed using `setPassword`\n    - The connection handle can be accessed via
  `getHandle`\n    - The version of the MPD server is available via `getVersion`\n
  \   - Added support for connecting via unix sockets\n\n* v0.4.2, 2010-08-31\n    -
  Only depend on QuickCheck when building the test target\n\n* v0.4.1, 2010-03-26\n
  \   - Fix building test and coverage targets\n\n* v0.4.0, 2010-03-26\n    - New
  maintainer: Joachim Fasting \\<joachim.fasting@gmail.com\\>\n    - Support QuickCheck
  2\n    - Better MPD api support\n      Should be mostly compatible with mpd 0.16\n

  by `show` of command parameters.\n    - Tidied up `Query` interface.\n    - Moved
  StringConn out of Network.MPD to the tests directory.\n\n* v0.2.1, 2008-04-14\n
  \   - Cleaned up libmpd.cabal.\n\n* v0.2.0, 2008-04-14\n    - A connection stub
