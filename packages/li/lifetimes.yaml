description: |
  Haskell library for flexible RAII-style resource management.

  This package provides a superset of the functionality supported by
  [resourcet][1]; in addition to allowing for early early release,
  it also provides move semantics: lifetimes are first class values
  and hierarchical, and resources can be moved between them after
  allocation.
