  # The not so great automatic Haskell licensor

  [![][2]](https://www.stackage.org/lts/package/licensor)
  [![][3]](https://www.stackage.org/nightly/package/licensor)

  Licensor is a program that generates a report of the dependencies and
  transitive dependencies of a Haskell project and their licenses.

  NOTE: Currently, [Stack](https://haskellstack.org/) and a `stack.yaml` file are
  required.

  ## Description

  Choosing a license for a software project or determining whether a
  particular dependency can be added to a project can be projects
  themselves. Unless starting from scratch, programmers should consider
  the licenses of the dependencies and transitive dependencies of their
  projects to make informed decisions and avoid license compatibility
  issues.

  Of course, this is just a starting point. "Beyond (...) general
  observations, it is difficult, if not impossible, to provide precise
  guidance about what licenses may or may not be compatible with each
  other. (...) Programmers who are considering combining code governed
  by two or more different licenses should proceed cautiously" (Andrew
  M. St. Laurent).

  ## Disclaimer

  Licensor is not a lawyer and does not provide legal advice.

  For more information about licenses and license compatibility issues,
  read the text of the licenses or consult with a lawyer before making
  any decision.

  ## Related programs

  Licensor is not the only license compatibility helper for Haskell:

  - Licensor uses a Cabal library and Stack program approach for
    detecting licenses and listing dependencies, respectively. For a
    Cabal library and program approach, consider using
    the [cabal-dependency-licenses][rp-01] program or the [cabal-plan][rp-02]
    utility.

  [rp-02]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-plan

  ## Installation and usage

  To install Licensor, use Cabal:

  ```
  $ cabal update && cabal install licensor
  ```

  Then, run the `licensor` executable inside a Haskell project:

  ```
  $ licensor
  ```

  To see the license report for Licensor, clone the repository:

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/jpvillaisaza/licensor
  ```

  And run `licensor` inside the project:

  ```
  $ cd licensor/ && licensor
  ```

  Or build and run `licensor` inside the project:

  ```
  $ cd licensor/ && stack build --exec licensor
  ```

  To generate a report including license files for all dependencies,
  use the `--licenses` option and redirect the output to a file:

  ```
  $ licensor --quiet --licenses > licenses.md
  ```

  See [licenses.md](licenses.md) for an example.

  NOTE: This is currently using the Hackage API, which doesn't require
  building any package, but could probably be improved to use the
  installed packages if present.

  For more information, run `licensor --help`:

  ```
  usage: licensor
    -q, -s  --quiet, --silent  Quiet/silent mode
            --licenses         Fetch license files
    -h      --help             Display help message
    -V      --version          Print version information
  ```

  ## Notes

  ### Dependencies

  Licensor uses the Stack program to list dependencies for a Haskell
  project. A future enhancement could be to use the Stack library.

  ### Licenses and license detection

  Licensor uses the Cabal library to detect the license of a Haskell
  project and its dependencies (including transitive dependencies). To
  do so, it uses the license field in the package description. A future
  enhancement could be to use both the license and licence file fields
  in the package description.

  Cabal provides an enumeration of common open source and free software
  licenses. These are the licenses that appear in the reports generated
  by Licensor:
