description: ! 'The @linearscan@ library is an implementation -- in Coq, extracted
  to

  Haskell -- of a register allocation algorithm developed by Christian Wimmer.

  It is described in detail in his Masters thesis, which can be found at

  <http://www.christianwimmer.at/Publications/Wimmer04a/Wimmer04a.pdf>.  A

  Java implementation of this same algorithm, by that author, is used in

  Oracle''s Graal project. It has also been implemented in C++ by Mozilla.


  This version of the algorithm was written and verified in Coq, containing

  over 231 proved lemmas, at over 10K LOC. It was funded as a research project

  by BAE Systems (<http://www.baesystems.com>), to be used in an in-house

  compiler written in Haskell.


  In order for the Coq code to be usable from Haskell, it is first extracted

  from Coq as a Haskell library, during which many of Coq''s fundamental types

  are mapped directly onto counterparts in the Haskell Prelude.


  Note that not every conceivable property of this library has been proven.

  For some of the lower layers this is true, because the algebraic constraints

  on these components could be exhaustively described in the context of their

  use. However, higher-level components represent a great variety of use

  cases, and not every one of these cases has been proven correct. This

  represents an ongoing effort, with the hope that proofs will entirely

  replace the necessity for ad hoc unit testing, and that at some point we can

  know that any allocation produced by this library must either fail, or be

  mathematically sound. In the absence of some complete coverage, this version

  of the library provides an optional, runtime verifier to confirm

  expectations of correctness, since it is easier to prove the validity of

  generated data, than of how it was generated.


  This library''s sole entry point is the function ''LinearScan.allocate'', which

  takes a list of basic blocks, and a functional characterization of those

  blocks, and produces a new list, with register allocations applied to their

  component operations.'
