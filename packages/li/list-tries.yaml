changelog: |
  # list-tries-0.6.7 (2020-05-12)
  * Updated dependencies and code for GHC 8.8 and 8.10.

  # list-tries-0.6.6 (2018-11-20)
  * Updated dependencies and code for GHC 8.6.1, thanks as usual to Mikhail
    Glushenkov.

  # list-tries-0.6.5 (2018-03-20)
  * Updated dependencies and code for GHC 8.4.1 and QuickCheck-2.11,
    thanks again to Mikhail Glushenkov.

  # list-tries-0.6.4 (2017-05-27)
  * Updated dependencies for GHC 8.2.1 (release candidate 2) and
    binary-0.9, thanks to Mikhail Glushenkov for helping with this.
  * Also a code change due to a newly problematic type inference.

  # list-tries-0.6.3 (2016-07-18)
  * Dependency update to allow dlist-0.8.

  # list-tries-0.6.2 (2016-06-28)
  * Updated dependencies for GHC 8.0.1.
  * Added Semigroup instances, bringing in a new dependency on semigroups
    on pre-8.0 GHC versions.

  # list-tries-0.6.1 (2015-04-03)
  * Fixed build on base < 4.8.

  # list-tries-0.6.0 (2015-03-28)
  * Updated dependencies for GHC 7.10.
  * Fixed library vs. test executable dlist dependency mismatch.
  * Renamed `Map.toList` to `toListKV` to avoid conflicts with the new
    `Foldable` class. Also renamed `Map.fromList` and `Map.fromListWith`
    to `fromListKV` and `fromListKVWith` to match. Thanks to davean for
    the patch.
  * Added Cabal source-repository metadata, pointing to GitHub.

  # list-tries-0.5.2 (2014-03-20)
  * Updated dependencies, for GHC 7.8 and other new packages.

  # list-tries-0.5.1 (2013-05-10)
  * Fix cabal build.
  * Minor documentation clarification.
  * Update `binary` dependency.

  # list-tries-0.5 (2013-05-09)
  * Added the `lookupPrefix` and `deleteSuffixes` functions, of which especially
    the former was an embarrassing omission:

          lookupPrefix   :: [k] -> trie map k a -> trie map k a
          deleteSuffixes :: [k] -> trie map k a -> trie map k a

  * Fixed the documentation headers to refer to 's' instead of 'k' as what we
    use for the length of the given key.
  * Fixed documentation of 'deletePrefix': its complexity is O(s), not O(m).
  * Some dependency updates.

  # list-tries-0.4.3 (2012-10-18)
  * Dependency updates for GHC 7.6 and otherwise.

  # list-tries-0.4.2 (2012-05-23)
  * Dependency updates for GHC 7.4, thanks to Anders Kaseorg.

  # list-tries-0.4.1 (2011-03-17)
  * Dependency update and Cabalization of the test executable, thanks to JP
    Moresmau.

  # list-tries-0.4 (2010-09-11)
  * Fixed documentation of the `deletePrefix` function: if the given key is not
    a prefix of any key, an empty, not unchanged, map/set is returned. Thanks to
    Brian Bloniarz for the bug report.
  * Fixed bug in the Patricia version of `deletePrefix` causing it to not delete
    anything if the prefix to be deleted was a proper prefix of the common
    prefix.
  * Changed `children` to return the map as-is instead of converting it into a
    list first:

          children :: Trie trie st map k => trie map k a -> CMap trie map k a

  * Added the `children1` function as a single-level equivalent of `children`,
    more directly reflecting the structure of the non-Patricia tries. Requested
    by Brian Bloniarz.

          children1 :: Trie trie st map k => trie map k a -> CMap trie map k a

  # list-tries-0.3 (2010-09-09)
  * Fixed strictness of the strict versions of the following
    non-Patricia functions: `insert`, `adjust`, `alter`, `union`,
    `difference`, `intersection`, `mapInKeys`; as well as the Patricia
    versions of `insert` and `adjust`. Thanks to Brian Bloniarz for the
    bug report.
  * Applied the static argument transformation throughout, improving
    performance.
  * Dropped support for containers < 0.3; GHC 6.12 has been out long
    enough, and support for older versions is too crippled to make it
    worthwhile.

  # list-tries-0.2 (2010-04-06)
  * Dependency update, nothing more.

  # list-tries-0.1 (2009-07-05)
  * All tries are now instances of `Binary`, thanks to Gregory Crosswhite. Adds a
    dependency on the `binary` library as well as the following two methods to
    the `Map` class in `Base.Map`:

          serializeToList     :: m k a -> [(k,a)]
          deserializeFromList :: [(k,a)] -> m k a

  # list-tries-0.0 (2009-04-21)
  * Initial release.
