  # linenoise

  A lightweight readline-replacement library for Haskell based on the `linenoise` library. (Not production ready!)
  See the [demo app](https://github.com/ejconlon/haskell-linenoise/blob/master/app/Main.hs) for usage, or see the [climb](https://github.com/ejconlon/climb) library for higher-level building blocks for GHCi-like REPLs with colon-commands.

  ## Differences from alternatives

  * `haskeline`
    * This uses FFI to a minimal C library vs pure Haskell
    * This uses standard MTL/Unlift typeclasses vs custom ones.
    * This does not require the use of a specific monad transformer.
  * `readline`
    * This offers a `MonadIO/MonadUnliftIO` interface vs raw `IO`.
    * This vendors and statically links its underlying library to simplify the build process.

  ## License and attribution

  This library includes the source code and license for `linenoise` in `cbits`.
  It is a fork of an older [library](https://github.com/sdiehl/haskell-linenoise) with all licensing and
  attribution preserved.

  ## Development workflow

  This project uses `stack` to build.

  The `Makefile` has a bunch of relevant phony targets for a development workflow including

  * `build` - Build the library and demo
  * `download` - Update vendored `linenoise`
  * `demo` - Run the demo app
  * `deps` - Install dev tools
  * `lint` - Lint with `hlint`
  * `format` - Format with `stylish-haskell`
  * `docs` - Generate docs

  In addition, there are targets starting with `ci` that are invoked in various CI phases.
