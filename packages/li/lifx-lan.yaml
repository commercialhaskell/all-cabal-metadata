  # Revision history for lifx-lan

  ## 0.8 -- 25-02-2023
  - Various minor improvements to MTL interfaces.
  - Update to latest products list

  ## 0.7.1 -- 21-10-2022
  - Handle invalid UTF-8 in light label.
  - Ensure discovery exits successfully when zero devices are wanted.

  ## 0.7 -- 2022-02-20
  - Drop support for GHC < 9.2.
      - If anyone is stuck on an older version of GHC and needs recent features of `lifx-lan` then please let me know. It would be reasonably easy to create a branch for it.
  - Don't provide field selector functions for any types. Using `OverloadedRecordDot` in client code is recommended. We still export `unLifxT` as a normal function, for backward compatibility.
  - Move much of the implementation detail of `LifxT` to `Lifx.Lan.Internal`.
  - Add `Lifx.Lan.Mock.Terminal` module for testing programs without a physical LIFX device.
  - Add `sendMessageAndWait` function.
  - Use `Text` rather than `ByteString` for `label` field of `LightState`.
  - Rename `productId` field of `Product` to `id`.
  - Update to latest products list.

  ## 0.6.2 -- 2022-02-02
  - Update to latest products list.

  ## 0.6.1 -- 2022-02-01
  - Update to latest products list.

  ## 0.6 -- 2021-12-23
  - Refactor to expose lower-level product lookup functionality via `Lifx.Internal.ProductInfoMap`.
  - To facilitate the above, modify `LifxError` slightly, with a new `ProductLookupError` type.

  ## 0.5.1 -- 2021-12-12
  - Implement `getProductInfo`.
  - Expose `LifxT` constructor.

  ## 0.5.0 -- 2021-08-01
  - Fix bug which was causing broadcasting not to work with messages that expect no response.

  ## 0.4.0 -- 2021-07-30
  - Use abstract Device type.
  - Use more types from standard libraries where appropriate:
      - PortNumber
      - NominalDiffTime
  - General cleanup and documentation improvements.

  ## 0.3.0 -- 2021-06-19
  - Implement message broadcasting and device discovery.

  ## 0.2.0 -- 2021-06-18
  - Enable querying state (colour or power level).
      - Various breaking changes to enable this.

  ## 0.1.0.2
  - Basic. Only supports setting power and colour.

  Haskell bindings to the [LIFX LAN API](https://lan.developer.lifx.com/docs).

  This library provides a reasonably high-level interface, but doesn't try to be *too* clever.
  For example, it doesn't check message delivery, and throws an error if a light takes too long to respond.
  Messages and response types map directly to the low-level API (with links provided in the documentation).

  It does not yet cover the full API, but PRs are very welcome and some functionality may be added on request.
