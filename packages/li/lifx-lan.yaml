  Haskell bindings to the [LIFX LAN API](https://lan.developer.lifx.com/docs).

  This library provides a reasonably high-level interface, but doesn't try to be *too* clever.
  For example, it doesn't check message delivery, and throws an error if a light takes too long to respond.
  Messages and response types map directly to the low-level API (with links provided in the documentation).

  It does not yet cover the full API, but PRs are very welcome and some functionality may be added on request.
