description: ! 'Bindings to the Coin/CBC integer linear programming solver

  ========


  This package provides bindings to the CBC library.

  These bindings work for simple programs, but might not be suitable for production
  use: see issues #7 and #8.


  In some cases, you may be better off pretty-printing the program with Numeric.Limp.Canon.Pretty
  in the limp package, writing the resulting program to file, and passing it to the
  external program.

  I hope to update this library to solve via the external program soon.
