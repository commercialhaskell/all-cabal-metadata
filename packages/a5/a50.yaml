description: "a50 is a tool for comparing genome assemblies, providing a bit more\ninformation
  than the usual numeric statistics, like N50.  For a quick\noverview of the options,
  use 'a50 --help'.\n\n\n  General usage\n  -------------\n\nTo compare assemblies,
  you need two or more fasta-formatted files\ncontaining contigs.  Running 'a50' with
  the files as arguments\nproduces a plot with one curve per input.  On the x-axis
  are the\ncontigs, ordered by size, and on the y-axis is the corresponding\ncumulative
  size.  Generally, a better assembly has a steeper curve\n(big contigs) which ends
  early (few contigs) near the y-value\ncorresponding to the expected genome size.\n\nThe
  plot is generated using 'gnuplot', so the gnuplot executable must\nbe in your $PATH.
  \ You can pass various information to gnuplot on the\ncommandline, specifically
  you can use -f to specify output format\n('terminal' in gnuplot lingo), -o to specify
  an output file, and -e to\nproduce horizontal lines, e.g. at the expected genome
  size.\n\nFor example:\n\n        a50 -t pdf -o asm.pdf asm1.fasta asm2.fasta -e
  8e+8\n\nwill plot the assemblies given in asm1.fasta and asm2.fasta against an\nexpected
  genome size of 800Mb in PDF format to the file asm.pdf.  If\nno output or format
  is specified, gnuplot will display the graph in a\nwindow.  If an output file, but
  no format is specified, a50 will try\nto determine the format from the file name
  extension.\n\n\n  Using EST or transcripts as a reference\n  ---------------------------------------\n\nA
  similar way to compare assemblies is to measure the gene coverage of\neach contig.
  \ To do this, you need to have the genes available,\ntypically in the form of raw
  or assembled ESTs.  By specifying a set\nof transcripts using the -E option, e.g:\n\n
  \       a50 asm.fasta asm2.fasta -E ests.fasta\n\nwill plot curves with contigs
  of the assemblies ordered by size along\nthe x-axis as before, but the y-value will
  be the total amount of\ntranscript data mapped to the contigs.\n\nThe mapping process
  runs BLAT, and stores the resulting PSL files in a\ntempdir, typically /tmp, but
  overriden with the $TMPDIR variable or\nspecified with -T.  Only the best hit for
  each EST is retained, so\nexons in other contigs are not counted.\n \n\n  Comparison
  to other measures\n  ----------------------------\n\nYou can read various other
  measures off the graph fairly easily.\nTotal assembly size is the y-value at which
  the curve ends, and the\nnumber of contigs in the assembly is the corresponding
  x-value.  An\nassembly with greater average contig size will end to the left and/or\nabove
  of an assembly with shorter average contigs.  N50 is the slope\nof the graph at
  the y-value corresponding to half the genome size.\n"
