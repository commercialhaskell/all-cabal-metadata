  ## Version 1.0.0.1 "Fight like a Pacifist" (2024-03-21)

  Developing this project has been a long, strange trip. I've taken clues and
  inspiration from so many different places, and the history of my in-the-moment
  thinking on these topics is not well-preserved. But I do have a few specific
  acknowledgments in mind.

  First of all, I'd like to thank Lois T Clark for teaching me how to fight like
  a pacifist. I'd like to thank Joe Taylor (K1JT) for WSPR and the WSJT suite of
  amateur radio protocols. I'd like to thank the State of Indiana for providing me
  with a world-class public education. These lessons directly inspired the goals
  and methodologies of this project.

  I'd like to thank Mike Dunn and Katalin Bimbo for trying to teach me relevance
  logic. While I still have no formal understanding of this topic, thinking about
  relevance was absolutely indispensable during this long development cycle.
  It helped me see through my own dubious ideas and justifications, it helped me
  modulate the goals and methodologies of this project, and it helped me make
  real progress on identifying plausibly-desirable design properties. In short,
  it took me to a design that I am so much happier with than I imagined at the
  outset of this project.

  I'd like to thank David Doiron for introducing me to signals and the theory of
  communication via optics, and Yuri Goldfeld and the Indiana Academy, especially
  the classes of 1998 and 1999 for so very inadvertently helping me piece together
  some of clues that lead me to this result.

  I'd like to thank Guo-Qiang Zhang and George Voutsadakis for teaching me about
  automata and the theory of computation, and to David Singer for introducing me
  to number theory, RSA cryptography, and digital identity.

  Finally, I'd like to thank the developers of HMAC, SHA256, PBKDF2, HKDF, and
  bcrypt for paving the way, Steve "sc00bz" Thomas and Soatok for sharing their
  valuable insights into cryptography with me, and Obsidian Systems for giving me
  opportunities to develop my skills in cryptography.
