description: "These modules provide an algebraic data type for atoms and proteins.\nThe
  data is expected to come from Protein Data Bank .pdb files. \nThe parser will interpret
  ATOM and HETATM record types.\n\nWhen implementing the parser over a large number
  of files:\n\n1. Compile your code. \n2. Use mapM_ in your main loop to ensure computations
  are done sequentially, otherwise you'll likely see a stack overflow.\n   There are
  certainly other solutions to memory management, depending on the sorts of computations
  that you're hoping to do.\n   If mapM_ doesn't suit your goals, you may want to
  explore seq and deepSeq.\n\n\nAt the moment, all vector operations are conducted
  by Vectors.hs. Be warned that\nthis is an unsafe module (it makes no effort to check
  vector lengths, etc. In our case everything is three dimensional, so this isn't
  a problem. Vectors.hs is a module that could benefit from a great deal of expansion.
  Matrix operations are hopefully coming soon.  \n"
