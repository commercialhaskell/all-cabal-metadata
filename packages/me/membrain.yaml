  This package implements type-safe memory units. It pursues the following goals:

  1. Focus on correctness.
  2. Low amount of boilerplate should be required to use the library.

  The ideas behind this package are described in the following blog post:

   * [Insane in the Membrain](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/membrain)

  The library is built around the following data type:

  ```haskell
  newtype Memory (mem :: Nat) = Memory
      { unMemory :: Natural
      }
  ```

  This data type stores every memory internally as bits. However, unit multiplier
  is stored as type-level natural number. This approach allows to represent
  different units and implement instances for them with low amount of boilerplate.

  `membrain` implements various useful functions to work with `Memory`:

  1. Smart constructors.
  2. Conversion functions.
  3. Pretty displaying.
  4. Dependently-typed parsing.
  5. Numeric functions.
  6. Type-safe wrappers around functions from `base`.
