description: |-
  @mealy@ provides support for computing statistics (such as an average or a standard deviation)
  as current state. Usage is to supply a decay function representing the relative weights of recent values versus older ones, in the manner of exponentially-weighted averages. The library attempts to be polymorphic in the statistic which can be combined in applicative style.

  == Usage

  >>> import Mealy

  >>> fold ((,) <$> ma 0.9 <*> std 0.9) [1..100]
