description: |-
  mediawiki2latex converts MediaWiki markup to LaTeX, PDF, EPUB and ODT.
  So it provides and export from MediaWiki to LaTeX.
  It works with any project running MediaWiki, especially Wikipedia and Wikibooks.
  Please note, that the program requieres certain run time dependencies. Those
  cannot be expressed in cabal and thus won't be installed when installing from hackage.
  So we strongly recommend to use the binaries included in debian as well as ubuntu or
  to use the binary version for windows provided on the sourcefogre project page.
