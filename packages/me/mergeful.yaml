  # Changelog

  ## [0.3.0.0] - 2022-06-19

  ### Added

  * `autodocodec` support

  ### Changed

  * Fixed a bug in which the `ValueSyncResponse` serialised conflicting values to JSON strangely.
  * Fixed a bug in which the `ItemSyncResponseConflict` and `ItemSyncResponseConflict` serialised conflicting values to JSON strangely.

  ## [0.2.0.0] - 2020-05-21

  ## Added

  * processServerSyncCustom and related
  * mergeSyncResponseCustom and related

  ### Changed

  * Another parameter: the client id so that you can use an sql id as the client id.
    This likely means that none of your code that works with mergeful-0.1 will compile anymore
    but it is easy to fix by adding the right parameter.

  ## [0.1.0.0] - 2019-09-23

  ### Changed

  * Compatibility with validity-containers >=0.5
