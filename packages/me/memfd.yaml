description: |
  "memfd" (**mem**ory **f**ile **d**escriptor) lets us open pseudo-"files" that
  are not actually stored in the "real" file system. This feature is only
  available on Linux.

  Such a file is described as an "anonymous file". It behaves like a regular file,
  and so can be modified, truncated, memory-mapped, and so on. However, unlike a
  regular file, it lives in RAM and has a volatile backing storage. Once all
  references to the file are dropped, it is automatically released.

  The recommended way to import this library is:

  ```haskell
  import qualified Memfd
  ```

  There is one central function:

  ```haskell
  create :: CreateOptions -> IO Fd
  ```

  [Fd](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/System-Posix-Types.html#t:Fd)
  stands for "file descriptor". Here are some things you can do with a file descriptor:

  - [Set the file size](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unix/docs/System-Posix-Files.html#v:setFdSize)
  - [Map the file](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/shared-memory/docs/MMAP.html#v:mmap)
    into your process's memory space
  - [Send the file descriptor](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/network/docs/Network-Socket.html#v:sendFd)
    over a Unix-domain socket to share the memory with another process
  - [Close the file](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unix/docs/System-Posix-IO.html#v:closeFd)
    and allow its contents to get garbage collected by the operating system
