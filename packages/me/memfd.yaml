description: |
  "memfd" (**mem**ory **f**ile **d**escriptor) memfd lets us open memory-only
  files that are not linked into a directory and are not backed by persistent
  storage.
  Such a file is described as an "anonymous file".
  It behaves like a regular file, and so can be modified, truncated,
  memory-mapped, and so on.
  However, unlike a regular file, it lives in RAM and has a volatile backing storage.
  Once all references to the file are dropped, it is automatically released.

  This feature is only available on Linux.

  The recommended way to import this library is:

  ```haskell
  import qualified Memfd
  ```

  There is one central function:

  ```haskell
  create :: CreateOptions -> IO Fd
  ```

  [Fd](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/System-Posix-Types.html#t:Fd)
  stands for "file descriptor". Here are some things you can do with a file descriptor:

  - [Set the file size](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unix/docs/System-Posix-Files.html#v:setFdSize)
  - [Map the file](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/shared-memory/docs/MMAP.html#v:mmap)
    into your process's memory space
  - [Send the file descriptor](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/network/docs/Network-Socket.html#v:sendFd)
    over a Unix-domain socket to share the memory with another process
  - [Close the file](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unix/docs/System-Posix-IO.html#v:closeFd)
    and allow its contents to get garbage collected by the operating system
