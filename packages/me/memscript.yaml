description: "# memscript\nCommand line utility for memorizing scriptures or any other
  text\n\n\nDescription: \"memscript <filename>\"\n\n  Run memscript with a UTF-8
  (or ASCII since ASCII is a subset of UTF8) \n  plain text file.  Try to exactly
  guess the text line by line.  If\n  your guess is wrong it will show you a diff
  like output comparing\n  your guess and the original verse.  This will repeat until
  you get\n  all the verses right.\n  \n  For the test data I included four beloved
  Psalms (1,23,121,127)\n  from the Old Testament, each in Revised Korean Version
  (RKV) and\n  New International Version (NIV), which I happened to have had to\n
  \ memorize.  You can use it for any other text you'd want to memorize,\n  such as
  your favorite poems, quotes, or whatsoever.\n  \n  No craft or ticks, really simple
  and straightforward utility but\n  serves well for the purpose.  I used readline
  because that was\n  the only sane way I know of handling multibyte inputs.\n\n\n"
