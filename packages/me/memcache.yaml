  # 0.3.0.1 - January 17th, 2021

  * Fix cabal file to have correct tag for github

  # 0.3.0.0 - January 17th, 2021

  * Bump package dependencies for newer GHC/back/network.
  * Update code to work with newer dependencies.

  # 0.2.0.1 - November 2nd, 2016

  * Fix compatability with latest `data-default-class`
  * Add new ReqRaw type for external clients to implement custom requests. Quite
    a hack right now, so behind a WARNING pragma.

  # 0.2.0.0 - May 27th, 2016

  * Big design change to reduce code duplication (`Protocol` module gone).
  * Remove `Options` type - just fixed configuration for now.
  * Design change also allows proper retry handling on operation failure - we
    retry an operation against the same server, but after N consecutive failures,
    we mark the server as dead and don't try using it again until M seconds has
    passed.
  * Simplify exception hierachy - just one type `MemcacheError` now for
  * Remove `defaultOptions` and `defaultServerSpec`, will revist usefulness.
    exceptions.
  * Remove many `Typeable` instances.
  * Support better testing with a mock Memcached server.
  * Fix bug in socket handling - detected EOF properly.
  * Greatly improve documentation.
  * Use `data-default-class` for defaults of servers and options.

  # 0.1.0.1 - February 26th, 2016

  * Consistent usage of 'memcached' instead of 'memcache'.
  * Document `Database.Memcache.Client`.
  * Add inline pragmas in appropriate places.
  * Fix bug handling fragmented IP packets (Alfredo Di Napoli).

  # 0.1.0.0 - May 18th, 2015

  * First proper release (although still lots of rough edges!).
  * Filled out `Data.Memcache.Client` to a complete API.
  * Integrated cluster and authentication handling.
  * Better error and exception handling.
  * Fix compilation under GHC 7.10.

  # 0.0.1 - May 5th, 2015

  * Initial (incomplete) support for a cluster of memcached servers.
  * Fixed compilation under GHC 7.4.

  # 0.0.0 - August 23rd, 2013

  * Initial release. Support for a single server.

  A client library for a memcached cluster.

  It supports the binary memcached protocol and SASL authentication. No support
  for the ASCII protocol is provided. It supports connecting to a single, or a
  cluster of memcached servers. When connecting to a cluser, consistent hashing
  is used for routing requests to the appropriate server.

  Complete coverage of the memcached protocol is provided except for multi-get
  and other pipelined operations.

  ## Licensing

  This library is BSD-licensed.

  ## Tools

  This library also includes a few tools for manipulating and experimenting with
  memcached servers.

  * `OpGen` -- A load generator for memcached. Doesn't collect timing statistics,
    other tools like [mutilate](https://github.com/leverich/mutilate) already do
    that very well. This tool is useful in conjunction with mutilate.
  * `Loader` -- A tool to load random data of a certain size into a memcached
    server. Useful for priming a server for testing.

  ## Architecture Notes

  We're relying on `Data.Pool` for thread safety right now, which is fine but is
  a blocking API in that when we grab a socket (`withResource`) we are blocking
  any other requests being sent over that connection until we get a response.
  That is, we can't pipeline.

  Now, use of multiple connections through the pool abstraction is an easy way to
  solve this and perhaps the right approach. But, could also implement own pool
  abstraction that allowed pipelining. This wouldn't be a pool abstraction so
  much as just round-robbining over multiple connections for performance.

  Either way, a pool is fine for now.

  ## Other clients

  * [C: libmemcached](http://libmemcached.org/libMemcached.html)
  * [Java: SpyMemcached](http://code.google.com/p/spymemcached/)
  * [Ruby: Dalli](https://github.com/mperham/dalli)
