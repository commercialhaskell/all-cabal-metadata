  # Changelog for mergeless

  ## [0.4.0.0] - 2022-06-19

  ### Added

  * Autodocodec support

  ### Changed

  * Made the json encoding of item sync types more sparse and forward-compatible.

  ## [0.3.0.0] - 2020-05-21

  ### Added

  * mergeSyncResponseCustom
  * emptySyncResponse: in case you want to do the sync response creation yourself

  ### Changed

  * Another parameter: the ClientId, so that you can use an sqlid as your client id
    This likely means that none of your code from mergeless-0.2 still compiles but it's easy to fix.

  ## [0.2.0.1] - 2020-02-13

  * Fixed the benchmarks

  ## [0.2.0.0] - 2020-02-12

  * Got rid of the UTCTimes. The client should take care of that.
