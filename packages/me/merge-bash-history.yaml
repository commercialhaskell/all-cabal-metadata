  # merge-bash-history

  Utility to be used with unison (http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/) to merge `.bash_history` file accross multiple machines.

  # Installation

  Clone the repository

  git clone https://github.com/j1r1k/merge-bash-history.git
  ```

  Install using stack
  ```
  cd merge-bash-history
  stack install

  # Example configuration in unison preferences file

  Assuming you have root set to your home directory and `merge-bash-history` is in your $PATH

  Add following to your unsion .prf file

  ```
  merge = Name .bash_history -> merge-bash-history CURRENT1 CURRENT2 > NEW
  backupcurrent = Name .bash_history
  ```

  # Manual usage

  ```
  merge-bash-history [INPUT-FILE1] [INPUT-FILE2] > [MERGED-FILE]
  ```
