description: "= mediawiki - Accessing MediaWiki from Haskell =\r\n\r\n'mediawiki'
  is a Haskell package providing a comprehensive binding to\r\nthe programmatic interface
  to MediaWiki (aka, 'the MediaWiki API') -\r\n\r\n  http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API\r\n\r\nThe
  binding is allegedly complete (2008-11-17), letting you write\r\napplications in
  Haskell that accesses and (if enabled by target Wiki)\r\nmanipulate content on MediaWiki
  pages.\r\n\r\n= Getting started =\r\n\r\nFor some code samples showing you how to
  get started using this\r\nAPI binding, have a look in the examples/ directory. \r\n\r\n=
  Building and installing =\r\n\r\nThis package is provided in Cabal form, so only
  thing you need to\r\ndo to get going is:\r\n\r\n  foo% runghc Setup configure\r\n
  \ foo% runghc Setup build \r\n  foo% runghc Setup install\r\n\r\nThe package depends
  on a bunch of other packages though, so you\r\nneed to have them built&installed,
  as well. They are:\r\n\r\n  * HTTP: http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/HTTP\r\n
  \ * xml: http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/xml\r\n  * mime:
  http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/mime\r\n  * utf8-string:
  http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/utf8-string\r\n\r\n=
  Feedback / question =\r\n\r\nPlease send them to sof@forkIO.com , and I'll try to
  respond to them\r\nas best/quickly as possible.\r\n"
