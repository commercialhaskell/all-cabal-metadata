description: ! "# mega-sdist\n\nThis is a utility written to address the specific
  needs in maintaining\nHaskell \"mega-repos,\" or Git repositories containing multiple
  Cabal\nprojects. It is intended to ease the process of deciding which\npackages
  need to be released and tagging those releases appropriately.\n\nIt provides the
  following functionality:\n\n* Detect when local code has changed from what's on
  Hackage\n    * Note that, due to Hackage revisions, sometimes this logic isn't\n
  \     perfect\n* Detect when a version number needs to be updated\n* Dump the difference
  between the Hackage version of your package and\n  the local version\n\nTo install
  it... well, listen. This tool is intended for people\nauthoring Haskell packages.
  Odds are, you already know how to do\nthis. And if you don't know, this probably
  isn't a tool that will help\nyou. Anyway, in order to install it, first\n[install
  Stack](https://haskell-lang.org/get-started) and then run\n`stack install mega-sdist`,
  or just `stack install` inside this\nrepository.\n\n## Opinionated tool\n\nThis
  utility is highly opinionated in some ways, e.g.:\n\n* It only supports one style
  of Git tag name:\n  `packagename-version`. This may look weird in non-mega-repos,
  where\n  `v1.2.3` looks better than `foo-1.2.3`, but for mega-repos the\n  former
  doesn't make sense. It also requires tag signing.\n* It depends on Stack for both
  discovering all of your local packages,\n  and for uploading to Hackage.\n\nIf you're
  OK with these opinions, keep reading for usage.\n\n## Have I changed anything?\n\nLet's
  say I'm working on the\n[monad-unlift megarepo](https://github.com/fpco/monad-unlift)
  (chosen\nas an example of a relatively small repo). I've merged some PRs\nrecently,
  or at least think I have. But I don't remember which of the\nindividual packages
  within the repo this affected. Instead of looking\nat the commit history like some
  caveman, I'll typically do:\n\n```\n$ git pull # make sure I have all latest changes\n$
  mega-sdist\n```\n\nThe `mega-sdist` command will:\n\n* Build tarballs for all local
  packages\n* Check what the latest versions of my packages on Hackage are\n* Do a
  full `diff` on these two things and see if anything's changed\n\nAt the time of
  writing, here's the output from this repo:\n\n```\nThe following packages from Hackage
  have not changed:\nmonad-unlift-0.2.0\n\nThe following packages require a version
  bump:\nmonad-unlift-ref-0.2.1\n```\n\nWhat this means is:\n\n* The `monad-unlift`
  package I have locally is at version `0.2.0`. And\n  it perfectly matches that version
  on Hackage. No actions necessary.\n* The `monad-unlift-ref` package I have locally
  is at version\n  `0.2.1`. And it doesn't match the code on Hackage. Therefore, if
  I\n  wanted to run `stack upload monad-unlift-ref` successfully, I'd need\n  to
  bump the version number.\n\n## What did I change?\n\nWell, again, if I wanted to
  see what changed, I could run (again, like\na caveman):\n\n```\n$ git diff monad-unlift-ref/0.2.1
  -- monad-unlift-ref\n```\n\nBut that's long! `mega-sidst`'s got your back. Just
  run:\n\n```\n$ mega-sdist monad-unlift-ref --get-diffs\n```\n\nThis will print out
  the difference between the tarball uploaded to\nHackage and what you have locally.
  Besides my tongue-in-cheek comment\nabove, this is also useful if, for some reason,
  you either don't have\nor don't trust the tags in your Git repo.\n\nOne other thing:
  this diff is currently based on the pristine tarball\nfrom Hackage, ignoring cabal
  file revisions. So the difference may be\nslightly different from what you'd get
  from `stack unpack\nmonad-unlift-ref-0.2.1`. But `¯\\_(ツ)_/¯` that's revisions for
  you.\n\nThe default behavior of `mega-sdist` is to look at all packages\nspecified
  in your `stack.yaml`. Targets can be any directory. And\n`mega-sdist` will automatically
  look at packages in any\n_subdirectory_, so that `mega-sdist .` is the same as `mega-sdist`
  at\nthe root of your repo\\*.\n\n\\* Assuming all of your packages are actually
  _in_ your repo, but only\ncrazy people would do otherwise.\n\n## Preparing a new
  release\n\nOK, now I continue working on my project, and I've:\n\n* Made some changes
  to `monad-unlift`\n* Updated the cabal file's version number\n    * And of course
  I also updated the `ChangeLog.md`, I'm not some\n      monster\n\nFrom the root
  of my repo, I run:\n\n```\n$ mega-sdist monad-unlift\n```\n\nOr, equivalently, from
  inside the `monad-unlift` subdirectory I run:\n\n```\n$ mega-sdist .\n```\n\nEither
  way, I get:\n\n```\nThe following new packages exist locally:\nmonad-unlift-0.2.1\n\nNo
  version bumps required, good to go!\n```\n\nThis tells me that my package has local
  changes, _and_ the version\nnumber has been updated, so that `stack upload monad-unlift`
  will\nwork. Neato! Now, you _could_ just run `stack upload ...`, but here's\nwhat
  I usually do. First, I'll review the changes I'm about to upload\nand make sure
  there are no surprises:\n\n```\n$ mega-sdist --get-diffs .\n\nThe following new
  packages exist locally:\nmonad-unlift-0.2.1\ndiff -r old/monad-unlift-0.2.0/ChangeLog.md
  new/monad-unlift-0.2.1/ChangeLog.md\n0a1,4\n> ## 0.2.1\n>\n> * Silly changes\n>\ndiff
  -r old/monad-unlift-0.2.0/Control/Monad/Trans/Unlift.hs new/monad-unlift-0.2.1/Control/Monad/Trans/Unlift.hs\n51a52,54\n>\n>
  -- I just need some space\n>\ndiff -r old/monad-unlift-0.2.0/monad-unlift.cabal
  new/monad-unlift-0.2.1/monad-unlift.cabal\n2c2\n< version:             0.2.0\n---\n>
  version:             0.2.1\n\nNo version bumps required, good to go!\n```\n\nOK,
  that's what I wanted. Time to release. Next, I'm going to use\n`mega-sdist` to tag
  the release:\n\n```\n$ mega-sdist --gittag .\n```\n\nFrom the root of my repo, this
  would notice that `monad-unlift-ref`\nstill requires a version bump, and refuse
  to proceed. But inside the\n`monad-unlift` directory, it notices that all necessary
  version bumps\nare done, and happily tags:\n\n```\n$ mega-sdist --gittag .\nThe
  following new packages exist locally:\nmonad-unlift-0.2.1\n\nNo version bumps required,
  good to go!\nRaw command: git tag -s monad-unlift-0.2.1 -m \"Release: monad-unlift-0.2.1\"\n```\n\nAnd
  suddenly I notice something new:\n\n```\n$ ls tarballs/\nmonad-unlift-0.2.1.tar.gz\n```\n\nNeat,
  `mega-sdist` left behind tarballs I can upload! To do so, I run:\n\n```\n$ stack
  upload tarballs/*\n```\n\nNote that this will work whether I'm trying to upload
  just one\npackage, or all of the updated packages in my repo. Finally, I need to\npush
  the new tags to Github (or wherever):\n\n```\n$ git push --tags\n```\n\nAnd in fact,
  this upload sequence is so common that I have a shell\nalias set up:\n\n```\n$ alias
  upload\nalias upload='mega-sdist --gittag . && stack upload tarballs/* && git push
  --tags'\n```\n\nSo there you have it: convenient little utility to help manage repos\nwith
  lots of packages in them.\n"
