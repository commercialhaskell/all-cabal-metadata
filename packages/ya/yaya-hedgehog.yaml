  # Changelog

  This file documents all notable changes to this package.

  The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
  and this project adheres to the [Haskell Package Versioning Policy](https://pvp.haskell.org/).

  ## 0.2.1.3 – 2024–03–11

  ### Added

  - The tests for `yaya` were previously in their own `yaya-test` package, but that has been folded into this package. Ideally, the tests would live in the `yaya` package, but Cabal doesn’t play well with circular dependencies between packages (even if the component dependencies aren’t circular).
