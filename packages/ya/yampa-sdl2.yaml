description: ! "# YampaSDL2\n\nYampaSDL2 is basically a headstart for the FRP library
  [Yampa](https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/Yampa) and SDL2. All the boilerplate
  which is normally necessary for these two libraries to work together is already
  taken care of. In the end, all that remains is a high-level interface specifically
  tailored to Yampa which should get you going in no time.\n\n![Screenshot](./screenshot.png)\n\nScreenshot
  of some drawn shapes.\n\n**My primary Goals:**\n- As little setup as possible\n-
  Easy to use (some feedback would be appreciated)\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- [ ] Display
  Shapes\n  - [x] Rectangle\n  - [x] Circle\n  - [x] Triangle\n  - [ ] Polygon\n-
  [x] Display Images\n- [x] Animations\n- [x] Handle Input\n- [ ] Play sound\n\n**This
  library is still work in progress**\n\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nyampa-sdl2
  uses the C-libraries\n- _sdl2_\n- _sdl2-gfx_\n\nConsequently, you need to have these
  two libraries installed on your computer.\n\n### Installation\n\nyampa-sdl2 is now
  on hackage! Adding yampa-sdl2 to your dependencies and executing the following should
  do the trick.\n\n```bash\nstack update\nstack solver --update-config\nstack build\n```\n\n##
  How to use\n\nHead over to the [wiki](https://github.com/Simre1/yampa-sdl2/wiki).\n\n##
