description: ! "# YampaSDL2\n\nYampaSDL2 is basically a headstart for the FRP library
  [Yampa](https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/Yampa) and SDL2. All the boilerplate
  which is normally necessary for these two libraries to work together is already
  taken care of. In the end, all that remains is a high-level interface specifically
  tailored to Yampa which should get you going in no time.\n\n![Screenshot](./screenshot.png)\n\nScreenshot
