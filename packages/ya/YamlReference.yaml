description: |-
  This package contains \"the\" reference YAML syntax parser
  ("Text.Yaml.Reference"), generated directly from the YAML
  specifications, as well as sample program (@yaml2yeast@)
  that allows accessing it from the command line, converting
  YAML files to YEAST tokens. This is intended to be more of
  an \"executable specification\" for YAML rather than an
  actual basis for YAML tool chains. That said, it is
  possible to build interesting tools on top of it, such as
  the @yeast2html@ YAML syntax visualizer (contained in this
  package), pretty printers, etc. This is a streaming parser
  that will \"immediately\" begin to generate output.
  Updated to be compatible with the final Apr 1, 2009 YAML
  1.2 spec.
