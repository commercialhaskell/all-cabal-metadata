description: "# 2048 game clone using Yampa FRP library\n\nAfter trying to grasp the
  idea of FRP (mostly concentrating on Yampa library) I\nhave finally found myself
  understanding it enough to write something simple.\n\n![yampa-2048 using Gloss](http://ksaveljev.github.io/2048.gif)\n\nThis
  project is based on some code by other people. I wasn't interested in\nimplementing
  the logic of 2048 myself or drawing to Gloss window from scratch.\nAs a result this
  repository contains some chunks of the code written by other\npeople:\n\n[Josh Kirklin](https://github.com/ScrambledEggsOnToast)
  and his [excellent\nimplementation of 2048 in Elm](https://github.com/ScrambledEggsOnToast/2048-elm)\n
  provided me with the game logic.\n\n[Maia Werbos](https://github.com/tigrennatenn)
  and her [great implementation of\n2048 using Gloss](https://github.com/tigrennatenn/2048haskell)
  provided me\nwith the rendering chunk of code.\n\nI was able to come up with my
  solution after reading the code by \n[Keera Studios](https://github.com/keera-studios)
  and their [amazing Haskanoid \nproject](https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/haskanoid)\n\nRunning:\n\n
  \   cabal sandbox init\n    cabal install --dependencies-only\n    cabal run\n\nThe
  gameplay is pretty simple. Nothing fancy. Try to survive for as long as\npossible.\n\nThings
  I would like to change but probably won't:\n- Gloss lacks the ability to style the
  font, therefore those numbers don't look\n  nice but as long as works it seems to
  be ok\n- I wanted the game to exit upon the Esc button press but didn't bother to\n
  \ investigate why it is not closing or how to do it\n"
