description: |-
  This program serves as a demonstration of the functions of the SG library
  (to be found on Hackage:
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/SG>)) by
  visualising it with OpenGL.  It also serves as a sort of informal test
  suite for the SG library.  Documentation is available at
  the top of the main module's source code.
