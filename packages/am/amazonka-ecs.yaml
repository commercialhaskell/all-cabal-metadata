  ## Version


  `1.4.4`



  ## Description


  Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container
  management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers
  on a cluster of EC2 instances. Amazon ECS lets you launch and stop container-enabled
  applications with simple API calls, allows you to get the state of your cluster
  from a centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features
  like security groups, Amazon EBS volumes, and IAM roles.


  You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster
  based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability requirements.
  Amazon EC2 Container Service eliminates the need for you to operate your own cluster
  management and configuration management systems or worry about scaling your management
  infrastructure.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-ecs)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

  > _Note:_ this library is an auto-generated Haskell package. Please see `amazonka-gen`
