  ## Version


  `1.4.1`



  ## Description


  Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and

  the applications you run on AWS in real-time. You can use CloudWatch to

  collect and track metrics, which are the variables you want to measure

  for your resources and applications.


  CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically make changes to

  the resources you are monitoring based on rules that you define. For

  example, you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your

  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and then use this

  data to determine whether you should launch additional instances to

  handle increased load. You can also use this data to stop under-used

  instances to save money.


  In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with AWS, you

  can monitor your own custom metrics. With CloudWatch, you gain

  system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application

  performance, and operational health.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-cloudwatch)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).
