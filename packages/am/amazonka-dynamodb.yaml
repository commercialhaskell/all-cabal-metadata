  Description\n\nAmazon DynamoDB\n\nThis is the Amazon DynamoDB API Reference. This
  guide provides\ndescriptions of the low-level DynamoDB API.\n\nThis guide is intended
  for use with the following DynamoDB\ndocumentation:\n\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/gettingstartedguide/
  Amazon DynamoDB Getting Started Guide>\n    - provides hands-on exercises that help
  you learn the basics of\n    working with DynamoDB. /If you are new to DynamoDB,
  we recommend\n    that you begin with the Getting Started Guide./\n\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/
  Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide>\n    - contains detailed information about DynamoDB
  concepts, usage, and\n    best practices.\n\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/dynamodbstreams/latest/APIReference/
  Amazon DynamoDB Streams API Reference>\n    - provides descriptions and samples
  of the DynamoDB Streams API.\n    (For more information, see\n    <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html
  Capturing Table Activity with DynamoDB Streams>\n    in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer
  Guide.)\n\nInstead of making the requests to the low-level DynamoDB API directly\nfrom
  your application, we recommend that you use the AWS Software\nDevelopment Kits (SDKs).
  The easy-to-use libraries in the AWS SDKs make\nit unnecessary to call the low-level
  DynamoDB API directly from your\napplication. The libraries take care of request
  authentication,\nserialization, and connection management. For more information,
  see\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/UsingAWSSDK.html
  Using the AWS SDKs with DynamoDB>\nin the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.\n\nIf
  you decide to code against the low-level DynamoDB API directly, you\nwill need to
  write the necessary code to authenticate your requests. For\nmore information on
  signing your requests, see\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/API.html
  Using the DynamoDB API>\nin the /Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide/.\n\nThe following
  are short descriptions of each low-level API action,\norganized by function.\n\n__Managing
  Tables__\n\n-   /CreateTable/ - Creates a table with user-specified provisioned\n
  \   throughput settings. You must define a primary key for the table -\n    either
  a simple primary key (partition key), or a composite primary\n    key (partition
  key and sort key). Optionally, you can create one or\n    more secondary indexes,
  which provide fast data access using non-key\n    attributes.\n\n-   /DescribeTable/
  - Returns metadata for a table, such as table size,\n    status, and index information.\n\n-
  \  /UpdateTable/ - Modifies the provisioned throughput settings for a\n    table.
  Optionally, you can modify the provisioned throughput\n    settings for global secondary
  indexes on the table.\n\n-   /ListTables/ - Returns a list of all tables associated
  with the\n    current AWS account and endpoint.\n\n-   /DeleteTable/ - Deletes a
  table and all of its indexes.\n\nFor conceptual information about managing tables,
  see\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithTables.html
  Working with Tables>\nin the /Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide/.\n\n__Reading Data__\n\n-
  \  /GetItem/ - Returns a set of attributes for the item that has a\n    given primary
  key. By default, /GetItem/ performs an eventually\n    consistent read; however,
  applications can request a strongly\n    consistent read instead.\n\n-   /BatchGetItem/
  - Performs multiple /GetItem/ requests for data items\n    using their primary keys,
  from one table or multiple tables. The\n    response from /BatchGetItem/ has a size
  limit of 16 MB and returns a\n    maximum of 100 items. Both eventually consistent
  and strongly\n    consistent reads can be used.\n\n-   /Query/ - Returns one or
  more items from a table or a secondary\n    index. You must provide a specific value
  for the partition key. You\n    can narrow the scope of the query using comparison
  operators against\n    a sort key value, or on the index key. /Query/ supports either\n
  \   eventual or strong consistency. A single response has a size limit\n    of 1
  MB.\n\n-   /Scan/ - Reads every item in a table; the result set is eventually\n
  \   consistent. You can limit the number of items returned by filtering\n    the
  data attributes, using conditional expressions. /Scan/ can be\n    used to enable
  ad-hoc querying of a table against non-key\n    attributes; however, since this
  is a full table scan without using\n    an index, /Scan/ should not be used for
  any application query use\n    case that requires predictable performance.\n\nFor
  conceptual information about reading data, see\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithItems.html
  Working with Items>\nand\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/QueryAndScan.html
  Query and Scan Operations>\nin the /Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide/.\n\n__Modifying
  Data__\n\n-   /PutItem/ - Creates a new item, or replaces an existing item with
  a\n    new item (including all the attributes). By default, if an item in\n    the
  table already exists with the same primary key, the new item\n    completely replaces
  the existing item. You can use conditional\n    operators to replace an item only
  if its attribute values match\n    certain conditions, or to insert a new item only
  if that item\n    doesn\\'t already exist.\n\n-   /UpdateItem/ - Modifies the attributes
  of an existing item. You can\n    also use conditional operators to perform an update
  only if the\n    item\\'s attribute values match certain conditions.\n\n-   /DeleteItem/
  - Deletes an item in a table by primary key. You can\n    use conditional operators
  to perform a delete an item only if the\n    item\\'s attribute values match certain
  conditions.\n\n-   /BatchWriteItem/ - Performs multiple /PutItem/ and /DeleteItem/\n
  \   requests across multiple tables in a single request. A failure of\n    any request(s)
  in the batch will not cause the entire\n    /BatchWriteItem/ operation to fail.
  Supports batches of up to 25\n    items to put or delete, with a maximum total request
  size of 16 MB.\n\nFor conceptual information about modifying data, see\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithItems.html

  is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-dynamodb)\nand
  the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).\n\nThe types from
  this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),\nwhich
  provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse
  of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the
  amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into
  more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any
  of the major lens libraries\n[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or
  [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).\n\n## Contribute\n\nFor
