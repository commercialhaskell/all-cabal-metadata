  ## Version


  `1.4.3`



  ## Description


  Amazon Cognito Sync


  Amazon Cognito Sync provides an AWS service and client library that enable cross-device
  syncing of application-related user data. High-level client libraries are available
  for both iOS and Android. You can use these libraries to persist data locally so
  that it\''s available even if the device is offline. Developer credentials don\''t
  need to be stored on the mobile device to access the service. You can use Amazon
  Cognito to obtain a normalized user ID and credentials. User data is persisted in
  a dataset that can store up to 1 MB of key-value pairs, and you can have up to 20
  datasets per user identity.


  With Amazon Cognito Sync, the data stored for each identity is accessible only to
  credentials assigned to that identity. In order to use the Cognito Sync service,
  you need to make API calls using credentials retrieved with <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognitoidentity/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html
  Amazon Cognito Identity service>.


  If you want to use Cognito Sync in an Android or iOS application, you will probably
  want to make API calls via the AWS Mobile SDK. To learn more, see the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-sync.html
  Developer Guide for Android> and the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/cognito-sync.html
  Developer Guide for iOS>.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-cognito-sync)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).
