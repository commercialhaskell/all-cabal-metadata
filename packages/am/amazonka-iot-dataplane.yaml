  ## Version


  `1.4.3`



  ## Description


  AWS IoT


  AWS IoT-Data enables secure, bi-directional communication between Internet-connected
  things (such as sensors, actuators, embedded devices, or smart appliances) and the
  AWS cloud. It implements a broker for applications and things to publish messages
  over HTTP (Publish) and retrieve, update, and delete thing shadows. A thing shadow
  is a persistent representation of your things and their state in the AWS cloud.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-iot-dataplane)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).
