  ## Version


  `1.4.2`



  ## Description


  AWS Import\/Export Service AWS Import\/Export accelerates transferring

  large amounts of data between the AWS cloud and portable storage devices

  that you mail to us. AWS Import\/Export transfers data directly onto and

  off of your storage devices using Amazon\''s high-speed internal network

  and bypassing the Internet. For large data sets, AWS Import\/Export is

  often faster than Internet transfer and more cost effective than

  upgrading your connectivity.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-importexport)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

  > _Note:_ this library is an auto-generated Haskell package. Please see `amazonka-gen`
