  ## Version


  `1.4.0`



  ## Description


  Amazon Route 53 is a scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It

  provides secure and reliable routing to your infrastructure that uses

  Amazon Web Services (AWS) products, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud

  (Amazon EC2), Elastic Load Balancing, or Amazon Simple Storage Service

  (Amazon S3). You can also use Amazon Route 53 to route users to your

  infrastructure outside of AWS.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-route53)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

  > _Note:_ this library is an auto-generated Haskell package. Please see `amazonka-gen`
  for more information.
