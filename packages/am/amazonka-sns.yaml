  `1.4.3`



  ## Description


  Amazon Simple Notification Service


  Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that enables you
  to build distributed web-enabled applications. Applications can use Amazon SNS to
  easily push real-time notification messages to interested subscribers over multiple
  delivery protocols. For more information about this product see <http://aws.amazon.com/sns/
  http:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/sns>. For detailed information about Amazon SNS features
  and their associated API calls, see the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/
  Amazon SNS Developer Guide>.


  We also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SNS from your preferred programming
  language. The SDKs contain functionality that automatically takes care of tasks
  such as: cryptographically signing your service requests, retrying requests, and
  handling error responses. For a list of available SDKs, go to <http://aws.amazon.com/tools/
  Tools for Amazon Web Services>.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-sns)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

  > _Note:_ this library is an auto-generated Haskell package. Please see `amazonka-gen`
