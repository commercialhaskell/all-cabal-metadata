  [Contribute](#contribute)\n* [Licence](#licence)\n\n\n## Version\n\n`1.4.0`\n\n\n##
  Description\n\nAWS Storage Gateway Service\n\nAWS Storage Gateway is the service
  that connects an on-premises software\nappliance with cloud-based storage to provide
  seamless and secure\nintegration between an organization\\'s on-premises IT environment
  and\nAWS\\'s storage infrastructure. The service enables you to securely\nupload
  data to the AWS cloud for cost effective backup and rapid\ndisaster recovery.\n\nUse
  the following links to get started using the /AWS Storage Gateway\nService API Reference/:\n\n-
  \  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewayHTTPRequestsHeaders.html
  AWS Storage Gateway Required Request Headers>:\n    Describes the required headers
  that you must send with every POST\n    request to AWS Storage Gateway.\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewaySigningRequests.html
  Signing Requests>:\n    AWS Storage Gateway requires that you authenticate every
  request you\n    send; this topic describes how sign such a request.\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/APIErrorResponses.html
  Error Responses>:\n    Provides reference information about AWS Storage Gateway
  errors.\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewayAPIOperations.html
  Operations in AWS Storage Gateway>:\n    Contains detailed descriptions of all AWS
  Storage Gateway\n    operations, their request parameters, response elements, possible\n
  \   errors, and examples of requests and responses.\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/index.html?rande.html
  AWS Storage Gateway Regions and Endpoints>:\n    Provides a list of each of the
  regions and endpoints available for\n    use with AWS Storage Gateway.\n\nAWS Storage
  Gateway resource IDs are in uppercase. When you use these\nresource IDs with the
  Amazon EC2 API, EC2 expects resource IDs in\nlowercase. You must change your resource
  ID to lowercase to use it with\nthe EC2 API. For example, in Storage Gateway the
  ID for a volume might\nbe vol-1122AABB. When you use this ID with the EC2 API, you
  must change\nit to vol-1122aabb. Otherwise, the EC2 API might not behave as expected.\n\nDocumentation
  is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-storagegateway)\nand
  the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).\n\nThe types from
  this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),\nwhich
  provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse
  of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the
  amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into
  more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any
  of the major lens libraries\n[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or
  [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).\n\n## Contribute\n\nFor
  any problems, comments, or feedback please create an issue [here on GitHub](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/issues).\n\n>
  _Note:_ this library is an auto-generated Haskell package. Please see `amazonka-gen`
  for more information.\n\n\n## Licence\n\n`amazonka-storagegateway` is released under
  the [Mozilla Public License Version 2.0](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/).\n\nParts
  of the code are derived from AWS service descriptions, licensed under Apache 2.0.\nSource
