  ## Version

  `1.6.1`


  ## Description

  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-discovery)
  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).

  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),
  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information, sending requests,
  and receiving responses.

  Lenses are used for constructing and manipulating types,
  due to the depth of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

  See [Network.AWS.Discovery](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-discovery/docs/Network-AWS-Discovery.html)
  or [the AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/) to get started.
