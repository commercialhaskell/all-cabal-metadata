  Description\n\nAWS Support\n\nThe AWS Support API reference is intended for programmers
  who need\ndetailed information about the AWS Support operations and data types.\nThis
  service enables you to manage your AWS Support cases\nprogrammatically. It uses
  HTTP methods that return results in JSON\nformat.\n\nThe AWS Support service also
  exposes a set of\n<https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/ Trusted
  Advisor>\nfeatures. You can retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get\ncheck
  results, specify checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of\nchecks.\n\nThe
  following list describes the AWS Support case management operations:\n\n-   __Service
  names, issue categories, and available severity levels.__\n    The < DescribeServices>
  and < DescribeSeverityLevels> operations\n    return AWS service names, service
  codes, service categories, and\n    problem severity levels. You use these values
  when you call the\n    < CreateCase> operation.\n-   __Case creation, case details,
  and case resolution.__ The\n    < CreateCase>, < DescribeCases>, < DescribeAttachment>,
  and\n    < ResolveCase> operations create AWS Support cases, retrieve\n    information
  about cases, and resolve cases.\n-   __Case communication.__ The < DescribeCommunications>,\n
  \   < AddCommunicationToCase>, and < AddAttachmentsToSet> operations\n    retrieve
  and add communications and attachments to AWS Support\n    cases.\n\nThe following
  list describes the operations available from the AWS\nSupport service for Trusted
  Advisor:\n\n-   < DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks> returns the list of checks that
  run\n    against your AWS resources.\n-   Using the @CheckId@ for a specific check
  returned by\n    < DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks>, you can call\n    < DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckResult>
  to obtain the results for the\n    check you specified.\n-   < DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckSummaries>
  returns summarized results\n    for one or more Trusted Advisor checks.\n-   < RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck>
  requests that Trusted Advisor rerun a\n    specified check.\n-   < DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses>
  reports the refresh\n    status of one or more checks.\n\nFor authentication of
  requests, AWS Support uses\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html
  Signature Version 4 Signing Process>.\n\nSee\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/Welcome.html
  About the AWS Support API>\nin the /AWS Support User Guide/ for information about
  how to use this\nservice to create and manage your support cases, and how to call
  Trusted\nAdvisor for results of checks on your resources.\n\nDocumentation is available
  via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-support)\nand the [AWS
  API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).\n\nThe types from this library
  are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),\nwhich
  provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse
  of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the
  amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into
  more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any
  of the major lens libraries\n[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or
  [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).\n\n## Contribute\n\nFor
  any problems, comments, or feedback please create an issue [here on GitHub](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/issues).\n\n>
  _Note:_ this library is an auto-generated Haskell package. Please see `amazonka-gen`
  for more information.\n\n\n## Licence\n\n`amazonka-support` is released under the
