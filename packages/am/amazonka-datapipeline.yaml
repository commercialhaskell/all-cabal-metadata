  ## Version


  `1.4.0`



  ## Description


  AWS Data Pipeline configures and manages a data-driven workflow called a

  pipeline. AWS Data Pipeline handles the details of scheduling and

  ensuring that data dependencies are met so that your application can

  focus on processing the data.


  AWS Data Pipeline provides a JAR implementation of a task runner called

  AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner. AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner provides

  logic for common data management scenarios, such as performing database

  queries and running data analysis using Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon

  EMR). You can use AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner as your task runner, or

  you can write your own task runner to provide custom data management.


  AWS Data Pipeline implements two main sets of functionality. Use the

  first set to create a pipeline and define data sources, schedules,

  dependencies, and the transforms to be performed on the data. Use the

  second set in your task runner application to receive the next task

  ready for processing. The logic for performing the task, such as

  querying the data, running data analysis, or converting the data from

  one format to another, is contained within the task runner. The task

  runner performs the task assigned to it by the web service, reporting

  progress to the web service as it does so. When the task is done, the

  task runner reports the final success or failure of the task to the web

  service.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-datapipeline)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).
