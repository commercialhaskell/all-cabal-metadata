  ## Version


  `1.4.1`



  ## Description


  Elastic Load Balancing


  Elastic Load Balancing distributes incoming traffic across your EC2

  instances.


  For information about the features of Elastic Load Balancing, see

  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/elastic-load-balancing.html
  What Is Elastic Load Balancing?>

  in the /Elastic Load Balancing Developer Guide/.


  For information about the AWS regions supported by Elastic Load

  Balancing, see

  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elb_region Regions and
  Endpoints - Elastic Load Balancing>

  in the /Amazon Web Services General Reference/.


  All Elastic Load Balancing operations are /idempotent/, which means that

  they complete at most one time. If you repeat an operation, it succeeds

  with a 200 OK response code.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-elb)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

  > _Note:_ this library is an auto-generated Haskell package. Please see `amazonka-gen`
