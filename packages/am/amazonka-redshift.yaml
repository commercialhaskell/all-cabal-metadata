  ## Description


  Amazon Redshift __Overview__


  This is an interface reference for Amazon Redshift. It contains documentation for
  one of the programming or command line interfaces you can use to manage Amazon Redshift
  clusters. Note that Amazon Redshift is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces
  may require techniques, such as polling or asynchronous callback handlers, to determine
  when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate
  whether a change is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during
  the next maintenance window. For a summary of the Amazon Redshift cluster management
  interfaces, go to <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/using-aws-sdk.html
  Using the Amazon Redshift Management Interfaces>.


  Amazon Redshift manages all the work of setting up, operating, and scaling a data
  warehouse: provisioning capacity, monitoring and backing up the cluster, and applying
  patches and upgrades to the Amazon Redshift engine. You can focus on using your
  data to acquire new insights for your business and customers.


  If you are a first-time user of Amazon Redshift, we recommend that you begin by
  reading the The <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/getting-started.html
  Amazon Redshift Getting Started Guide>


  If you are a database developer, the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/welcome.html
  Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide> explains how to design, build, query,
  and maintain the databases that make up your data warehouse.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-redshift)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).
