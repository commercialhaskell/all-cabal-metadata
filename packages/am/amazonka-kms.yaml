  Description\n\nAWS Key Management Service\n\nAWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
  is an encryption and key management\nweb service. This guide describes the AWS KMS
  operations that you can\ncall programmatically. For general information about AWS
  KMS, see the\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/ AWS Key Management
  Service Developer Guide>.\n\nAWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample
  code for various\nprogramming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android,\netc.).
  The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access\nto AWS KMS and
  other AWS services. For example, the SDKs take care of\ntasks such as signing requests
  (see below), managing errors, and\nretrying requests automatically. For more information
  about the AWS\nSDKs, including how to download and install them, see\n<http://aws.amazon.com/tools/
  Tools for Amazon Web Services>.\n\nWe recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make
  programmatic API calls to\nAWS KMS.\n\nClients must support TLS (Transport Layer
  Security) 1.0. We recommend\nTLS 1.2. Clients must also support cipher suites with
  Perfect Forward\nSecrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic
  Curve\nEphemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and\nlater
  support these modes.\n\n__Signing Requests__\n\nRequests must be signed by using
  an access key ID and a secret access\nkey. We strongly recommend that you /do not/
  use your AWS account access\nkey ID and secret key for everyday work with AWS KMS.
  Instead, use the\naccess key ID and secret access key for an IAM user, or you can
  use the\nAWS Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials\nthat
  you can use to sign requests.\n\nAll AWS KMS operations require\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html
  Signature Version 4>.\n\n__Logging API Requests__\n\nAWS KMS supports AWS CloudTrail,
  a service that logs AWS API calls and\nrelated events for your AWS account and delivers
  them to an Amazon S3\nbucket that you specify. By using the information collected
  by\nCloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to AWS KMS, who\nmade
  the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about\nCloudTrail, including
  how to turn it on and find your log files, see the\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/
  AWS CloudTrail User Guide>.\n\n__Additional Resources__\n\nFor more information
  about credentials and request signing, see the\nfollowing:\n\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html
  AWS Security Credentials>\n    - This topic provides general information about the
  types of\n    credentials used for accessing AWS.\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/
  AWS Security Token Service>\n    - This guide describes how to create and use temporary
  security\n    credentials.\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html
  Signing AWS API Requests>\n    - This set of topics walks you through the process
  of signing a\n    request using an access key ID and a secret access key.\n\n__Commonly
  Used APIs__\n\nOf the APIs discussed in this guide, the following will prove the
  most\nuseful for most applications. You will likely perform actions other than\nthese,
  such as creating keys and assigning policies, by using the\nconsole.\n\n-   < Encrypt>\n-
  \  < Decrypt>\n-   < GenerateDataKey>\n-   < GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext>\n\nDocumentation
  is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-kms)\nand
  the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).\n\nThe types from
  this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),\nwhich
  provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse
  of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the
  amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into
  more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any
  of the major lens libraries\n[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or
  [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).\n\n## Contribute\n\nFor
  any problems, comments, or feedback please create an issue [here on GitHub](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/issues).\n\n>
  _Note:_ this library is an auto-generated Haskell package. Please see `amazonka-gen`
  for more information.\n\n\n## Licence\n\n`amazonka-kms` is released under the [Mozilla
  Public License Version 2.0](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/).\n\nParts of the code are
