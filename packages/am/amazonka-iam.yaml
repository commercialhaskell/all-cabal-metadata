  Version\n\n`1.4.1`\n\n\n## Description\n\nAWS Identity and Access Management\n\nAWS
  Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that you can\nuse to manage
  users and user permissions under your AWS account. This\nguide provides descriptions
  of IAM actions that you can call\nprogrammatically. For general information about
  IAM, see\n<http://aws.amazon.com/iam/ AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)>.\nFor
  the user guide for IAM, see\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/ Using
  IAM>.\n\nAWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various\nprogramming
  languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android,\netc.). The SDKs provide
  a convenient way to create programmatic access\nto IAM and AWS. For example, the
  SDKs take care of tasks such as\ncryptographically signing requests (see below),
  managing errors, and\nretrying requests automatically. For information about the
  AWS SDKs,\nincluding how to download and install them, see the\n<http://aws.amazon.com/tools/
  Tools for Amazon Web Services> page.\n\nWe recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to
  make programmatic API calls to\nIAM. However, you can also use the IAM Query API
  to make direct calls to\nthe IAM web service. To learn more about the IAM Query
  API, see\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html
  Making Query Requests>\nin the /Using IAM/ guide. IAM supports GET and POST requests
  for all\nactions. That is, the API does not require you to use GET for some\nactions
  and POST for others. However, GET requests are subject to the\nlimitation size of
  a URL. Therefore, for operations that require larger\nsizes, use a POST request.\n\n__Signing
  Requests__\n\nRequests must be signed using an access key ID and a secret access
  key.\nWe strongly recommend that you do not use your AWS account access key ID\nand
  secret access key for everyday work with IAM. You can use the access\nkey ID and
  secret access key for an IAM user or you can use the AWS\nSecurity Token Service
  to generate temporary security credentials and\nuse those to sign requests.\n\nTo
  sign requests, we recommend that you use\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html
  Signature Version 4>.\nIf you have an existing application that uses Signature Version
  2, you\ndo not have to update it to use Signature Version 4. However, some\noperations
  now require Signature Version 4. The documentation for\noperations that require
  version 4 indicate this requirement.\n\n__Additional Resources__\n\nFor more information,
  see the following:\n\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html
  AWS Security Credentials>.\n    This topic provides general information about the
  types of\n    credentials used for accessing AWS.\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAMBestPractices.html
  IAM Best Practices>.\n    This topic presents a list of suggestions for using the
  IAM service\n    to help secure your AWS resources.\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html
  Signing AWS API Requests>.\n    This set of topics walk you through the process
  of signing a request\n    using an access key ID and secret access key.\n\nDocumentation
  is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-iam)\nand
  the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).\n\nThe types from
  this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),\nwhich
  provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse
  of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the
  amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into
  more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any
  of the major lens libraries\n[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or
  [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).\n\n## Contribute\n\nFor
  any problems, comments, or feedback please create an issue [here on GitHub](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/issues).\n\n>
  _Note:_ this library is an auto-generated Haskell package. Please see `amazonka-gen`
  for more information.\n\n\n## Licence\n\n`amazonka-iam` is released under the [Mozilla
