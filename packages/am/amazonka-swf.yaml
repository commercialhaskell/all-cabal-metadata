  ## Version


  `1.4.4`



  ## Description


  Amazon Simple Workflow Service


  The Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) makes it easy to build applications
  that use Amazon\''s cloud to coordinate work across distributed components. In Amazon
  SWF, a /task/ represents a logical unit of work that is performed by a component
  of your workflow. Coordinating tasks in a workflow involves managing intertask dependencies,
  scheduling, and concurrency in accordance with the logical flow of the application.


  Amazon SWF gives you full control over implementing tasks and coordinating them
  without worrying about underlying complexities such as tracking their progress and
  maintaining their state.


  This documentation serves as reference only. For a broader overview of the Amazon
  SWF programming model, see the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/
  Amazon SWF Developer Guide>.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-swf)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).
