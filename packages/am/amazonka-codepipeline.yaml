  Description\n\nAWS CodePipeline __Overview__\n\nThis is the AWS CodePipeline API
  Reference. This guide provides\ndescriptions of the actions and data types for AWS
  CodePipeline. Some\nfunctionality for your pipeline is only configurable through
  the API.\nFor additional information, see the\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html
  AWS CodePipeline User Guide>.\n\nYou can use the AWS CodePipeline API to work with
  pipelines, stages,\nactions, gates, and transitions, as described below.\n\n/Pipelines/
  are models of automated release processes. Each pipeline is\nuniquely named, and
  consists of actions, gates, and stages.\n\nYou can work with pipelines by calling:\n\n-
  \  < CreatePipeline>, which creates a uniquely-named pipeline.\n-   < DeletePipeline>,
  which deletes the specified pipeline.\n-   < GetPipeline>, which returns information
  about a pipeline\n    structure.\n-   < GetPipelineState>, which returns information
  about the current\n    state of the stages and actions of a pipeline.\n-   < ListPipelines>,
  which gets a summary of all of the pipelines\n    associated with your account.\n-
  \  < StartPipelineExecution>, which runs the the most recent revision\n    of an
  artifact through the pipeline.\n-   < UpdatePipeline>, which updates a pipeline
  with edits or changes to\n    the structure of the pipeline.\n\nPipelines include
  /stages/, which are which are logical groupings of\ngates and actions. Each stage
  contains one or more actions that must\ncomplete before the next stage begins. A
  stage will result in success or\nfailure. If a stage fails, then the pipeline stops
  at that stage and\nwill remain stopped until either a new version of an artifact
  appears in\nthe source location, or a user takes action to re-run the most recent\nartifact
  through the pipeline. You can call < GetPipelineState>, which\ndisplays the status
  of a pipeline, including the status of stages in the\npipeline, or < GetPipeline>,
  which returns the entire structure of the\npipeline, including the stages of that
  pipeline. For more information\nabout the structure of stages and actions, also
  refer to the\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/pipeline-structure.html
  AWS CodePipeline Pipeline Structure Reference>.\n\nPipeline stages include /actions/,
  which are categorized into categories\nsuch as source or build actions performed
  within a stage of a pipeline.\nFor example, you can use a source action to import
  artifacts into a\npipeline from a source such as Amazon S3. Like stages, you do
  not work\nwith actions directly in most cases, but you do define and interact with\nactions
  when working with pipeline operations such as < CreatePipeline>\nand < GetPipelineState>.\n\nPipelines
  also include /transitions/, which allow the transition of\nartifacts from one stage
  to the next in a pipeline after the actions in\none stage complete.\n\nYou can work
  with transitions by calling:\n\n-   < DisableStageTransition>, which prevents artifacts
  from\n    transitioning to the next stage in a pipeline.\n-   < EnableStageTransition>,
  which enables transition of artifacts\n    between stages in a pipeline.\n\n__Using
  the API to integrate with AWS CodePipeline__\n\nFor third-party integrators or developers
  who want to create their own\nintegrations with AWS CodePipeline, the expected sequence
  varies from\nthe standard API user. In order to integrate with AWS CodePipeline,\ndevelopers
  will need to work with the following items:\n\n-   Jobs, which are instances of
  an action. For example, a job for a\n    source action might import a revision of
  an artifact from a source.\n\n    You can work with jobs by calling:\n\n    -   <
  AcknowledgeJob>, which confirms whether a job worker has\n        received the specified
  job,\n    -   < GetJobDetails>, which returns the details of a job,\n    -   < PollForJobs>,
  which determines whether there are any jobs to\n        act upon,\n    -   < PutJobFailureResult>,
  which provides details of a job failure,\n        and\n    -   < PutJobSuccessResult>,
  which provides details of a job success.\n-   Third party jobs, which are instances
  of an action created by a\n    partner action and integrated into AWS CodePipeline.
  Partner actions\n    are created by members of the AWS Partner Network.\n\n    You
  can work with third party jobs by calling:\n\n    -   < AcknowledgeThirdPartyJob>,
  which confirms whether a job worker\n        has received the specified job,\n    -
  \  < GetThirdPartyJobDetails>, which requests the details of a job\n        for
  a partner action,\n    -   < PollForThirdPartyJobs>, which determines whether there
  are any\n        jobs to act upon,\n    -   < PutThirdPartyJobFailureResult>, which
  provides details of a\n        job failure, and\n    -   < PutThirdPartyJobSuccessResult>,
  which provides details of a\n        job success.\n\nDocumentation is available
  via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-codepipeline)\nand the
  [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).\n\nThe types from this
  library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),\nwhich
  provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse
  of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the
  amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into
  more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any
  of the major lens libraries\n[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or
  [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).\n\n## Contribute\n\nFor
