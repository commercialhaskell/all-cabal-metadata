  ## Version


  `1.4.4`



  ## Description


  AWS Elastic Beanstalk


  AWS Elastic Beanstalk makes it easy for you to create, deploy, and manage scalable,
  fault-tolerant applications running on the Amazon Web Services cloud.


  For more information about this product, go to the <http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/
  AWS Elastic Beanstalk> details page. The location of the latest AWS Elastic Beanstalk
  WSDL is <http://elasticbeanstalk.s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2010-12-01/AWSElasticBeanstalk.wsdl>.
  To install the Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development Environment
  (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools that enable you to access the API, go to
  <https://aws.amazon.com/tools/ Tools for Amazon Web Services>.


  __Endpoints__


  For a list of region-specific endpoints that AWS Elastic Beanstalk supports, go
  to <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elasticbeanstalk_region
  Regions and Endpoints> in the /Amazon Web Services Glossary/.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-elasticbeanstalk)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).


  ## Contribute


  For any problems, comments, or feedback please create an issue [here on GitHub](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/issues).


  > _Note:_ this library is an auto-generated Haskell package. Please see `amazonka-gen`
  for more information.
