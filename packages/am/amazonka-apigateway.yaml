  ## Version


  `1.4.0`



  ## Description


  Amazon API Gateway


  Amazon API Gateway helps developers deliver robust, secure and scalable

  mobile and web application backends. Amazon API Gateway allows

  developers to securely connect mobile and web applications to APIs that

  run on AWS Lambda, Amazon EC2, or other publicly addressable web

  services that are hosted outside of AWS.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-apigateway)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).
