  # Revision history for lens-process

  ## 0.3.0.0

  Final design - this will not change unless `System.Process` significantly changes.

  - `System.Process.Lens.CommandSpec` is renamed to `System.Process.Lens.CmdSpec` to be more flush with the data names
  - documentation improvements all around
  - Type signatures of combinators `inheriting`, `piping`, `handling` and `nostreaming` have had their unnecessary constraints dropped
  - `microlens-process` is now in lockstep featurewise

  ## 0.2.0.0

  The module formerly known as `Internal.hs` is now called `ProcessHandler.hs`

  the `CreateProcess` optics have changed to avoid name clashes with `System.IO (stdin, stderr, stdout)`,
  instead opting for the post-fixed underscore.

  Added doctest suite.


  ## 0.1.0.0

  Decided agains the internal module, narrowing scope

  ## 0.0.5.0

  Expanded the zoo, better docs

  ## 0.0.4.0

  Added 'Internal' module providing convenient handlers for the output of a `createProcess` call.

  Added some spurious deps for future work on `process`

  ## 0.0.3.0

  ## 0.0.2.0

  Widened bounds, fixed up some documentation, added few combinators

  ## 0.0.1.0

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  # lens-process

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/lens-process.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-process)
  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/emilypi/lens-process.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/emilypi/lens-process)

  This package is intended to be on the lighter side, with few dependencies aside from `lens`. For full disclosure, this is the minimal dependency graph of `lens-process`:

  ### Motivation

  `lens-process` provides optics for the [process](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/process) package. These optics provide convenient lenses, traversals, and prisms, as well as classy variants for significant classifiable portions of the library for convenience. In addition, we provide some combinators for working with `CreateProcess` types. The intention of this package is to create a well-typed optical layer for `process`, reflecting the shape of certain types of commands at the type level.
