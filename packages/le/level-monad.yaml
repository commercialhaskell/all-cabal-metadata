  Non-Determinism Monad for Level-Wise Search
  ===========================================

  This Haskell library provides an implementation of the MonadPlus type
  class that enumerates the levels of the search space using
  breadth-first search or iterativ deepening.

  A search space is formed by calls to `return` and `mplus` yielding a
  search tree with solutions in its leaves. For example, in the monadic
  action

      return 1 `mplus` ((return 2 `mplus` return 3) `mplus` return 4)

  the result 1 is in the second level, 4 in the third, and the results 2
  and 3 are in the forth level. This is apparent from the following
  representation of this monadic action:

                 `mplus`
               /         \
         return 1          `mplus`
                         /         \
                     `mplus`      return 4
                   /         \
               return 2    return 3

  However, the implementation does not build this tree structure as a
  data term but constructs its levels directly.

  The library provides an operation to get the list of levels from a
  non-deterministic computation. The nth element in this list contains
  the results of the computation that are found on the nth level of the
  computation.
