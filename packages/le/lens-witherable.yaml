  Integrate witherable and lens.

  Based on the ideas from https://chrispenner.ca/posts/witherable-optics
  but with a more combinator-based approach to restore full
  compatibility with lens combinators like `set` and
  `over`. Additionally, this approach gets rid of `Maybe` wrappers in
  results that are always `Just`.

  This library is based on a variant of `Traversal`s with the type
  `forall f. Applicative f => ((a-> Withering f b) -> s -> f t)`. Note
  that this type is absolutely not an optic due to the `Withering`
  wrapper, but it's really close. It composes on either side with lenses
  and traversals with `(.)` and that composition maintains the filtering
  type. No type alias is provided for this type because type aliases
  containing a `forall` cause problems with subsumption.

  The core tool for creating values with these types is

  ```haskell
  withered
      :: (Applicative f, Witherable t)
      => (a -> Withering f b) -> t a -> f (t b)
  ```

  One tool for working with the types is

  ```haskell
  mapMaybeOf
      :: ((a -> Withering Identity b) -> s -> Identity t)
      -> (a -> Maybe b) -> s -> t
  ```

  These can be used like such

  ```haskell
  ghci> let z = M.fromList [('a', ["1", "2", "3"]), ('b', ["4", "Alpaca", "6"])]

  ghci> z & mapMaybeOf (traverse . withered) (readMaybe :: String -> Maybe Int)
  fromList [('a',[1,2,3]),('b',[4,6])]

  ghci> z & mapMaybeOf (withered . traverse) (readMaybe :: String -> Maybe Int)
  fromList [('a',[1,2,3])]
  ```

  As those results demonstrate, the location of the `withered`
  combinator controls where the pruning stops. It functions as a kind of
  catch combinator in this sense.

  Of course, `filterOf` is provided as well

  ```haskell
  filterOf
      :: ((a -> Withering Identity a) -> s -> Identity s)
      -> (a -> Bool) -> s -> s
  ```

  ```haskell
  ghci> [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] & filterOf (traverse . withered) even
  [[2],[4,6]]
  ```

  Traversals that might fail can be combined with the `decayed`
  combinator to cause them to completely remove a value that they
  otherwise would ignore

  ```haskell
  ghci> [('a', Right 1), ('b', Left 2), ('c', Left 3)] & filterOf (withered . _2 . _Left) even
  [('a',Right 1),('b',Left 2)]

  ghci> [('a', Right 1), ('b', Left 2), ('c', Left 3)] & filterOf (withered . _2 . (_Left `failing` decayed)) even
  [('b',Left 2)]
  ```

  In the first case, the `'a'` value is returned because the filter
  doesn't find any non-even values under the `Right` value when it's
  looking under the `_Left` prism. In the second case, the failure of
  the `_Left` prism results in falling back on `decayed` to remove the
  branch.

  Compatibility with normal lens operations can be restored with
  `unwithered`. This can be especially useful when combined with
  `guarded`, which acts somewhat like lens's `filtered` but it prunes
  the structure up to the next `withered`.

  ```haskell
  unwithered :: Functor f => (a -> f b) -> a -> Withering f b

  guarded
      :: Applicative f
      => (a -> Bool) -> (a -> Withering f b)
      -> a -> Withering f b
  ```

  ```haskell
  ghci> [[1,2],[],[1,3,9],[],[],[6,4,7],[]] & withered . guarded (not . null) . unwithered . traverse +~ 10
  [[11,12],[11,13,19],[16,14,17]]
  ```

  Note that pruning out the empty lists happens in-line with the
  modification of the other elements. An additional combinator is
  provided combining `withered` and `unwithered` for when you want to
  change the pruning depth

  ```haskell
  rewithered
      :: (Applicative f, Witherable t)
      => (a -> Withering f b) -> t a -> Withering f (t b)
  ```

  ```haskell
  ghci> [[1,2],[],[1,3,9],[],[],[6,4,7],[]] & (withered . guarded (not . null) . rewithered . guarded even . unwithered) +~ 10
  [[12],[],[16,14]]
  ```

  In that example, the first `guarded` strips out null lists in the
  input. The `rewithered` descends into the sublists and sets each of
  them as the catch point for later pruning. The second `guarded` strips
  out all non-even entries in each list. The `unwithered` restores
  compatibility with lens combinators like `(+~)`, which is used to
  modify every remaining focused value. Note the presence of the `[]` in
  the output list. The `guarded` combinator violates the lens laws in
  the same manner as `filtered`, where behavior might change with
  refactoring. This doesn't mean it's dangerous to use, merely that you
  have to pay attention to changes in behavior when refactoring chains
  involving it.
