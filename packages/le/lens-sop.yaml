  # Change log

  ## 0.3 - 2023-02-22

  This release modernizes the library a bit (breaking backwards compatibility):
  instead of providing interoperability with `fclabels`, it instead uses
  `optics-core`, and instead of using arrows, it uses monads.
basic-deps:
  optics-core: '>=0.4 && <0.5'
  base: '>=4.6 && <4.18'
  transformers: '>=0.3 && <0.7'
  generics-sop: '>=0.2.3 && <0.6'
all-versions:
- 0.1.0.0

- 0.1.0.2
- 0.2.0.0

description: |
  This library contains a definition of generalized lenses, along with SOP-style
  generic functions (based on
  @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generics-sop generics-sop>@)
  that compute lenses for a given record type. Generalized lenses for the
  SOP representation types are also provided.

  Furthermore, a generic function is provided that computes a lens from
  a given (string-based) path specification.
