changelog: |
  0.2.6 [2021.11.16]
  ------------------
  * Drop support for pre-8.0 versions of GHC.

  0.2.5 [2021.02.17]
  ------------------
  * Allow building with `lens-5.*`.
  * The build-type has been changed from `Custom` to `Simple`.
    To achieve this, the `doctests` test suite has been removed in favor of using
    [`cabal-docspec`](https://github.com/phadej/cabal-extras/tree/master/cabal-docspec)
    to run the doctests.

  0.2.4 [2019.09.13]
  ------------------
  * Remove the use of `cpp-options: -traditional`. This should be unnecessary
    on all versions of GHC that `lens` supports, as modern GHCs already use
    `-traditional` internally during preprocessing. More critically, the use
    of `cpp-options: -traditional` breaks profiling builds on GHC 8.8
    (see https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/17185).

  0.2.3 [2018.01.18]
  ------------------
  * Add an `Apply` context to the `Monoid` instance for `Effect`, allowing
    `lens-action` to build against `lens-4.16`.

  0.2.2
  -----
  * Add a library dependency for the `doctests` test suite

  0.2.1
  -----
  * Revamp `Setup.hs` to use `cabal-doctest`. This makes it build
    with `Cabal-2.0`, and makes the `doctest`s work with `cabal new-build` and
    sandboxes.

  0.2.0.2
  ---
  * Migrate to new `phantom` definition in `contravariant`

  0.2.0.1
  ---
  * Add `Control.Lens.Action.Type` to exposed-modules list.

  0.2
  ---
  * `profunctors-5` and `lens-4.10` support

  0.1.0.1
  ---
  * Add `Control.Lens.Action.Type` to exposed-modules list.

  0.1
  ----
  * Initial split from lens package
