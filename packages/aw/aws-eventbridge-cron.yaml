  # aws-eventbridge-cron

  Parse AWS EventBridge cron, rate, and one-time expressions and compute their
  future run times.

  Status: early preview. Expect small API tweaks before a `1.0.0` release.

  ## Features

  - Single entry point: `AWS.EventBridge.Cron` exports the `CronExprT` type,
    `parseCronText` parser, and `nextRunTimes` scheduler.
  - Full support for EventBridge-specific syntax such as `?` wildcards, `L`, `LW`,
    weekday ranges, and nth-weekday modifiers (`2#1`).
  - `rate(...)` and `at(...)` expressions share the same API, so callers do not
    need to branch on expression variants.
  - Extensive property-based test suite that mirrors the behaviour documented by
    AWS.

  ## Installation

  ```
  cabal install aws-eventbridge-cron
  ```

  Or add the package to your component:

  ```cabal
  build-depends:
      aws-eventbridge-cron >= 0.1 && < 0.2
  ```

  ## Quick Start

  ```haskell
  import AWS.EventBridge.Cron
  import Data.Time (UTCTime(..), fromGregorian)
  import Data.Time.LocalTime (TimeOfDay(..), timeOfDayToTime)

  base :: UTCTime
  base = UTCTime (fromGregorian 2025 11 16) (timeOfDayToTime (TimeOfDay 9 0 0))

  example :: Either String [UTCTime]
  example = do
    expr <- parseCronText "cron(0/15 9 ? NOV SUN 2025)"
    nextRunTimes expr base 4
  -- Right [2025-11-16 09:00:00 UTC, 2025-11-16 09:15:00 UTC, ...]
  ```

  The parser also accepts `rate(...)` and `at(...)` expressions:

  ```haskell
  rateExample :: Either String [UTCTime]
  rateExample = do
    expr <- parseCronText "rate(10 minutes)"
    nextRunTimes expr base 3

  atExample :: Either String [UTCTime]
  atExample = do
    expr <- parseCronText "at(2025-11-16T09:30:00)"
    nextRunTimes expr base 5
  ```

  ### Error Reporting

  Parser and evaluator failures return `Left String` with human-readable error
  messages:

  ```haskell
  Left "day-of-month and day-of-week fields must use '?' in exactly one position"
  ```

  The messages mirror the constraints enforced by EventBridge when you create
  scheduled rules.

  ## Design Notes

  - `CronExprT` is intentionally opaque. Construct values with `parseCronText` and
    feed them into `nextRunTimes`.
  - Scheduling honours the EventBridge rule that exactly one of day-of-month or
    day-of-week must be `?`.
  - Results are monotonic, capped at the requested limit, and never fall before
    the supplied base time.

  See `test/AWS/EventBridge/CronSpec.hs` for more examples and edge cases.

  ## Development

  ```bash
  cabal build
  cabal test
  cabal haddock --open
  ```

  ## Contributing

  Bug reports, suggestions, and pull requests are welcome. Please open an issue
  before large-scale changes so we can keep the API coherent.
