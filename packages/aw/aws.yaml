changelog: |+
  0.22 series
  -----------

  -   0.22
      - Support GHC 8.8
      - Support network-3
      - Support http-client 0.6+
      - S3: add etag to PutObjectResponse
      - Add IAM group manipulation methods

  0.21 series
  -----------

  -   0.21.1
      - S3: Add PutBucketVersioning command

  -   0.21
      - S3: Make user DisplayName field optional (used in "GetBucket"
        among other places)
      - Use HTTP.getGlobalManager from http-client-tls by default (more
        efficient, and we have a transitive dependency on the package
        anyways)

  0.20 series
  -----------

  -   0.20
      - Update to conduit 1.3 and http-conduit 2.3 (breaking API change
        due to removal of ResumableSource, which was used in public APIs)
      - S3: Fix to V2 string signing

  0.19 series
  -----------

  -   0.19
      - Experimental support for V4 signing
      - Add "eu-west-2" endpoint for some services
      - Loosen http-conduit bounds

  0.18 series
  -----------

  -   0.18
      -   Switch from cryptohash to cryptonite
      -   Loosen boundaries for http-types and conduit-extra

  0.17 series
  -----------

  -   0.17.1

  0.16 series
  -----------

  NOTES: 0.16 brings technically breaking changes, which should not affect
  most users. I recommend using smart constructors and {} matching syntax
  whenever possible when interacting with aws types.

  -   0.16
      -   S3: Add support for versioning
      -   S3: [breaking change] Move version ID from UploadPartResponse to
          CompleteMultipartUpload.

      -   DDB: Expose the new DynBool type
      -   S3: Add ETag fields to get/head object

      -   DDB: Support consistent reads in Scan requests

      -   CryptoHash update
  -   0.7.6.3

          response size limits.
      -   Put aws functions in ResourceT to be able to safely return
          Sources and streams.

              with S3.getObject.
      -   Updated dependencies:
          -   conduit 0.5 (as well as http-conduit 1.5 and
              xml-conduit 1.0).

  Introduction
  ============

  The `aws` package attempts to provide support for using Amazon Web
  Services like S3 (storage), SQS (queuing) and others to Haskell
  programmers. The ultimate goal is to support all Amazon Web Services.

  Installation
  ============

  Make sure you have a recent GHC installed, as well as cabal-install, and
  installation should be as easy as:

  ``` {.bash}
  $ cabal install aws
  ```

  If you prefer to install from source yourself, you should first get a
  clone of the `aws` repository, and install it from inside the source
  directory:

  ``` {.bash}
  $ git clone https://github.com/aristidb/aws.git
  $ cd aws
  $ cabal install
  ```

  Using aws
  =========

  Concepts and organisation
  -------------------------

  The aws package is organised into the general `Aws` module namespace,
  and subnamespaces like `Aws.S3` for each Amazon Web Service. Under each
  service namespace in turn, there are general support modules and and
  `Aws.<Service>.Commands.<Command>` module for each command. For easier
  usage, there are the "bundling" modules `Aws` (general support), and
  `Aws.<Service>`.

  The primary concept in aws is the *Transaction*, which corresponds to a
  single HTTP request to the Amazon Web Services. A transaction consists
  of a request and a response, which are associated together via the
  `Transaction` typeclass. Requests and responses are simple Haskell
  records, but for some requests there are convenience functions to fill
  in default values for many parameters.

  Example usage
  -------------

  To be able to access AWS resources, you should put your into a
  configuration file. (You don't have to store it in a file, but that's
  how we do it in this example.) Save the following in `$HOME/.aws-keys`.

  ``` {.example}
  default AccessKeyID SecretKey
  ```

  You do have to replace AccessKeyID and SecretKey with the Access Key ID
  and the Secret Key respectively, of course.

  Then, copy this example into a Haskell file, and run it with `runghc`
  (after installing aws):

  ``` {.haskell}
  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

  import qualified Aws
  import qualified Aws.S3 as S3
  import           Control.Monad.Trans.Resource
  import           Data.Conduit ((.|), runConduit)
  import           Data.Conduit.Binary (sinkFile)
  import           Network.HTTP.Conduit (newManager, tlsManagerSettings, responseBody)

  main :: IO ()
  main = do
    {- Set up AWS credentials and the default configuration. -}
    cfg <- Aws.baseConfiguration
    let s3cfg = Aws.defServiceConfig :: S3.S3Configuration Aws.NormalQuery

    {- Set up a ResourceT region with an available HTTP manager. -}
    mgr <- newManager tlsManagerSettings
    runResourceT $ do
      {- Create a request object with S3.getObject and run the request with pureAws. -}
      S3.GetObjectResponse { S3.gorResponse = rsp } <-
        Aws.pureAws cfg s3cfg mgr $
          S3.getObject "haskell-aws" "cloud-remote.pdf"

      {- Save the response to a file. -}
      runConduit $ responseBody rsp .| sinkFile "cloud-remote.pdf"
  ```

  You can also find this example in the source distribution in the
  `Examples/` folder.

  Frequently Asked Questions
  ==========================

  S3 questions
  ------------

  -   I get an error when I try to access my bucket with upper-case
      characters / a very long name.

      Those names are not compliant with DNS. You need to use path-style
      requests, by setting `s3RequestStyle` in the configuration to
      `PathStyle`. Note that such bucket names are only allowed in the US
      standard region, so your endpoint needs to be US standard.
