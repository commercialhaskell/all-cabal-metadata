  Takes an optional argument which is the number
  of threads (the default is three).  Give it the commands to run, one
  per line, through standard input.
  You may use blank lines to divide the commands into sections.  The
  commands in a section will not be started until all the commands in
  previous sections are complete.  Each section can be given its own
  thread count.
