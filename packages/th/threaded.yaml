  # threaded

  Aims to make managed, horizontal scaling easier - given some process that reads from a concurrent channel,
  writes to a concurrent channel, and returns when it's finished, then it should be horizontally scalable
  with respect to some thread identifier:

  ```haskell
  main :: IO ()
  main = do
    let mult inputs outputs = do
          -- get first input
          x <- atomically (readTChanRW inputs)
          -- get second input
          y <- atomically (readTChanRW inputs)
          let o :: Integer
              o = (x :: Integer) * (y :: Integer)

          -- write output
          atomically (writeTChanRW outputs o)
          -- return

    -- incoming messages for specific threads
    incoming <- writeOnly <$> atomically newTChanRW

    (mainThread, outgoing) <- threaded incoming mult

    echoingThread <- async $ forever $ do
      -- do something with each thread's output
      (k,o) <- atomically (readTChanRW outgoing)
      putStrLn $ show k ++ ": " ++ show o

    atomically $ writeTChanRW incoming ("one",1)
    atomically $ writeTChanRW incoming ("two",2)
    atomically $ writeTChanRW incoming ("three",3)
    atomically $ writeTChanRW incoming ("one",1)
    atomically $ writeTChanRW incoming ("two",2)
    atomically $ writeTChanRW incoming ("three",3)

    threadDelay 1000000

    cancel echoingThread
    cancel mainThread
  ```

  If the thread's identifier doesn't exist when sending an input, then the `threaded` manager will spark a new
  one. If it does exist, then it just plumbs it to its input channel. Once the process returns, the thread with
  that identifier is killed and garbage collected.
