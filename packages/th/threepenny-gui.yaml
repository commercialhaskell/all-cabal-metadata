  ## Changelog for the `threepenny-gui` package

  **0.9.1.0** – Maintenance and snapshot release

  * Add support for websockets over SSL.
  * Bump dependencies for compatibility with GHC 9.0.

  **0.9.0.0** – Maintenance and snapshot release

  * The events `contextmenu`, `mousedown`, `mousemove` and `mouseup` now return
    `Double` coordinates instead of `Int`s. This change reflects updates to the
    underlying browser APIs and the jQuery library. [#238][]

    Users who prefer to keep working with `Int` coordinates may use the added
    `roundCoordinates` compatibility function.

  * Bump dependencies to allow `aeson` 1.5.

  * Fix the spelling of the `refX` and `refY` SVG attributes.
    `refX` and `refY` are added to `Graphics.UI.Threepenny.SVG.Attributes`,
    the old lowercase versions are deprecated.
  * Invoke compatibility mode of IE11 for jQuery v3.2.1.
  * Compatibility with GHC-8.6.1

  * Exclude `websockets` 0.12.5.0 from dependencies.

  **0.8.2.3** – Maintenance release

  * Compatibility with GHC-8.4.1
  * Bump dependencies to allow `aeson` 1.3.0.0
  * Bump dependencies to allow `exceptions` 0.10.0
  * Bump dependencies to allow `snap-server` 1.1.0.0

  **0.8.2.1** — Maintenance release

  * Bump dependencies to allow `async` 2.2
  * Fix a compatibility issue with Cabal-2.0

  **0.8.2.0** — Snapshot release

  * Add `getCookies` function that retrieves the cookies sent with the HTTP request when the browser window connects (to the websocket). [#137][]
  * Allow Electron process to be accessed from JavaScript FFI. [#200][] This means that Threepenny is now more useful when used with the [Electron][] framework, see [doc/electron.md](doc/electron.md) for more information on that.
  * Bump dependencies to allow `file-embed` 0.0.10.1

    [electron]: https://electron.atom.io

  **0.8.1.0** — Snapshot release

  * Improve documentation and handling of call buffering (`CallBufferMode`). The default call buffer mode was documented incorrectly, it was  `BufferRun` and is now `FlushOften`. [#163][], [#191][], [#192][]
  * Add new default `CallBufferMode`: `FlushOften`. This mode is like `BufferRun`, but will flush the buffer at every `onEvent` as well, leading to less confusion when using the library in most circumstances. [#191][]
  * Add new `CallBufferMode`: `FlushPeriodically`. This mode is like `BufferRun`, but will flush the call buffer every 300ms if nonempty. [#192][]
  * Add support for [custom DOM events][customevent] (`CustomEvent`). [#196][]
  * Expose JavaScript FFI functions `toJSObject` and `liftJSWindow` in `Graphics.UI.Threepenny`. This is useful for linking the lifetime of JavaScript objects to the lifetime of `Element`. [#181][]
  * Use `jsLog` parameter to log exceptions. [#185][]
  * Update bundled jQuery to version 3.2.1. [#186][]

  **0.8.0.1** — Maintenance release

  * Bump dependencies for compatibility with GHC-8.2.1
  * Bump dependencies to allow `websockets` 0.12

  **0.8.0.0** — Snapshot release

  Graphics.UI.Threepenny

  * Fix `getElementById` to properly return `Nothing` when no element with the given `id` attribute is present. [#129][].
  * Bring back `loadFile` and `loadDirectory`. [#110][]
  * Add `MonadUI` typeclass for easier lifting in custom monad stacks. [#173][]

  JavaScript FFI

  * Implement batching / buffering for FFI calls. [#131][]. Several calls to the `runFunction` function may now buffer the JavaScript code and send it to the browser window in a single message at a later time. This improves performance considerably.
  * Clarify semantics for exceptions. See the file [`doc/javascript-ffi.md`](doc/javascript-ffi.md) for more.
      * The `UI` monad now supports exception handling by being an instance of the type classes `MonadThrow` and `MonadCatch`.
      * The function `callFunction` can now throw a `JavaScriptException` exception to the Haskell side.
      * The function `runFunction` now terminates the connection to the browser window whenever the JavaScript code within throws an exception.
  * Exceptions in the `UI` monad that are not handled are now printed properly for better debugging. [#145][]
  * Clarify semantics of the `disconnect` event. It is now triggered more reliably. [#133][].
  * Remove unnecessary client response when exporting event handlers. [#131][].
  * Add option `jsWindowReloadOnDisconnect` to reload the browser window [#130][] whenever the WebSocket connection is broken. This is useful for e.g. mobile devices, which tend to disconnect WebSocket connections very often.

  * Bump dependencies to allow `aeson` 0.11

  **0.6.0.5** — Maintenance release

  * Bump dependencies to allow `async` 2.1
  * Bump dependencies to allow `transformers` 0.5

  **0.6.0.4** — Maintenance release.

  * Elements that have become unreachable, for instance because they have been removed from the DOM and are no longer reachable in the Haskell code, will be garbage collected again. Fix [#109][], [#113][].
  * Adjust dependencies.
  * Add `<meta>` tag to indicate UTF8 encoding in html file. [#116][]

    [#113]: https://github.com/HeinrichApfelmus/threepenny-gui/issues/113
    [#109]: https://github.com/HeinrichApfelmus/threepenny-gui/issues/109
    [#116]: https://github.com/HeinrichApfelmus/threepenny-gui/issues/116

  **0.6.0.3** — Maintenance release.

  * Temporary fix for #109, which was causing event handlers to be discarded. Unfortunately, this means that elements are currently not garbage collected after they have been removed from the DOM tree.

  **0.6.0.2** — Maintenance release.

  * Remove unused direct dependencies, in particular
  ** attoparsec-enumerator
  ** utf8-string
  ** MonadCatchIO-transformers
  ** time

  **0.6.0.1** — Maintenance release.

  * The `ADDR` environment variable is now parsed correctly.
  * Now builds on GHC 7.8 and GHC 7.10
  * The example source code in the `samples` folder has been reorganized and consolidated.

  **0.6.0.0** — Snapshot release.

  * The internals of the JavaScript FFI has been reimplemented completely. A new module `Foreign.JavaScript` exports a bare JavaScript FFI in case you want to write a custom GUI framework. However, the module `Graphics.UI.Threepenny` is *not* compatible with it, even though it builds on top of it.
  * The fields of `Config` type for server configuration are now prefixed with `js` instead of `tp`. Example: `jsPort`, `jsStatic`.
  * The functions `loadFile` and `loadDirectory` have been *removed*, as I felt that the `jsStatic` option is sufficient for most use cases.

  **0.5.0.0** — Snapshot release.

  * Possibility to specify IP address to bind the server to.
  * FFI now supports callbacks into Haskell. Remove `callDeferredFunction` function.
  * `Graphics.UI.Threepenny.Canvas.SVG` for creating SVG elements and attributes.
  * 2D graphics API in `Graphics.UI.Threepenny.Canvas` is beginning to grow.
  * `Bool` is now correctly marshalled to JavaScript.
  * `Text` can now be marshalled to JavaScrtip.

  **0.4.2.0** — Maintenance release.

  * Dependency `bytestring >=0.9.2` is now implemented correctly.
  * Allow newer versions of `aeson` dependency.
  * Allow newer versions of `network`, `transformers` and `template-haskell` dependencies.
  * Helper scripts in the `samples` directory now assume that you use a cabal sandbox for development.
  * The `UI` monad is now an instance of the `Applicative` class.

  **0.4.1.0** — Maintenance release.

  * Dependency on `text` package now from version 0.11 to 1.1.*.
  * Dependency on `aeson` package replaces the former dependency on the `json` package.
  * Unicode characters are now transmitted correctly to the browser. #75, #62.

  # Threepenny-GUI

  ### What's this?

  Threepenny is a GUI framework written in Haskell that uses the web browser as a display. It's very easy to install. See the

    [**Project homepage**](http://wiki.haskell.org/Threepenny-gui)

  for more information on what it does and can do for you as a library user.

  ### Examples

  The library comes with many examples, which can be found in the [samples](samples#readme) folder. Follow the link for more information on how to run them.

  ### Desktop Apps

  Threepenny is mainly intended for writing GUI applications that run on the local network, and it relies on a web browser being installed. You can drop the latter requirement and integrate it a bit more tightly with you desktop environment by using the Electron framework. There is no fully automated support for this yet, but the documentation includes a [tutorial on how to use Electron with Threepenny](doc/electron.md).

  # Technical overview

  ### JavaScript FFI

  A program written with Threepenny is essentially a small web server that displays the user interface as a web page to any browser that connects to it.

  The web server displays a HTML page, which in turn establishes WebSocket connection with the server. The server uses this connection to send JavaScript code that is executed in the client. In the library, this appears as a JavaScript Foreign Function Interface (FFI). The documentation includes [more information on the design of the JavaScript FFI](doc/javascript-ffi.md).

  ### Latency

  The frequent communication between browser and server
  means that Threepenny is best used as a GUI server running on localhost. You can use it on your local network as well.

  If you want to reduce latency, the best option is to generate larger blocks of JavaScript
  code and run them on the client. Consider this approach similar to [a
  shading language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shading_language).
  You can import any JavaScript library and use it from the JavaScript FFI.

  If you don't want to write JavaScript, then you could choose a Haskell-like language like [PureScript](http://www.purescript.org), [Fay](https://github.com/faylang/fay/wiki). You can also directly compile Haskell to JavaScript with [Haste](https://github.com/valderman/haste-compiler) or [GHCJS](https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs).

  # Future ideas

  ### HTML rendering mode

  It might be nice in the case of search engines to merely generate a DOM and render it, so that search engines can read the pages.

  ### UI libraries

  [qooxdoo](http://qooxdoo.org/demo) — provides a feature-complete widget set. One could wrap this in a type-safe API from Threepenny and get a complete, stable UI framework for free. Most of the "immediate feedback" like dragging things here, switching tabs there, are taken care of by the framework. All that would be left would be to provide the domain configuration and business/presentation logic.

  There are plenty more like this, but this is the first that springs to
  mind that is good.
