  # Change Log

  All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

  ## [0.8.2] - 2020-09-29

  * Allow building with `template-haskell-2.17.0.0` (GHC 9.0).
  * Make `deriveLift` work for unlifted newtypes.

  ## [0.8.1] - 2019-12-06

  * Support GHC 8.10/`template-haskell-2.16`.
  * Derive implementations of `liftTyped` (in addition to `lift`) when using
    `template-haskell-2.16` or later.
  * Fix a bug in which derived `Lift` instances for data types containing
    `Addr#` would fail to typecheck.

  ## [0.8.0.1] - 2019-05-09

  * Support GHC 8.8/`template-haskell-2.15`.

  ## [0.8] - 2019-04-26

  * Remove `Lift ()`, `Ratio`, `Identity` and `Const ()` instances.
    These are now provided in [`th-lift-instances` package](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/th-lift-instances)
  - Use `TemplateHaskellQuotes` where available

  ## [0.7.11] - 2018-08-27

  * Support for GHC 8.6.

  ## [0.7.10] - 2018-02-01

  * Add support for data families

  ## [0.7.9] - 2018-02-01

  * `Lift` instances for `Identity` and `Const`.

  ## [0.7.8] - 2018-02-01

  * GHC 8.4 compatibility.

  ## [0.7.7] - 2015-04-19

  * GHC 8.2 compatibility.

  ## [0.7.6] - 2015-01-18

  * GHC 8.1 compatibility.

  ## [0.7.5] - 2015-11-19

  * Added `makeLift`, for cases when it's necessary to write the
    instance manually. (Thanks to Ryan Scott).
  * Support empty datatypes and unboxed types.

  ## [0.7] - 2014-12-07

  * Support GHC 7.9 and hopefully 7.10, thanks to Richard Eisenberg.
  * On versions of GHC that support role inference, don't constrain
    phantom type variables.
  * Get rid of some orphan instances when using GHC >= 7.9.

  ## [0.6] - 2013-12-09

  * Support GHC 7.8, thanks to Michael Snoyberg.
  * Support existentially quantified type variables in datatype
    declarations.
  * Handle exotic kinds properly.

  ## [0.5.2] - 2010-09-19

  * Support older GHCs and Cabal, thanks to Ben Millwood.

  ## [0.5] - 2010-08-05

  * Support for contexts in datatypes, thanks to Ben Millwood.
  * `deriveLiftWith` becomes `deriveLift'` and takes an `Info`
    structure rather than a custom reification function.
  * Add `deriveLiftMany` to derive many `Lift` instances in one go.

  ## [0.4] - 2010-08-02

  * Add support for newtypes and records syntax, thanks to a patch by
    Ben Millwood.
  * Add support for infix constructors.
  * `deriveLift` returns a list of declarations.
  * New `deriveLiftWith` function with custom reification, following
    a feature request by Jonas Duregård.

  ## [0.3] - 2010-03-24

  * Port to Template Haskell 2.4.
  * Maintainer is now Mathieu Boespflug.

  ## [0.2] - 2006-09-06

  Initial release by Ian Lynagh.

  Derive Template Haskell's @Lift@ class for datatypes using @TemplateHaskell@.
  The functionality in this package has largely been subsumed by the
  @DeriveLift@ language extension, which is available in GHC 8.0 and later
  versions. This package can still be useful as a uniform way to derive
  @Lift@ instances that is backwards-compatible with older GHCs.

  The following libraries are related:

  * The <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/th-orphans th-orphans> package
  provides instances for @template-haskell@ syntax types.

  * The <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/th-lift-instances th-lift-instances>
  package provides @Lift@ instances for types in @base@, @text@,
  @bytestring@, @vector@, etc. Some of these instances are only provided for
  old versions of their respective libraries, as the same @Lift@ instances
  are also present upstream on newer versions.
