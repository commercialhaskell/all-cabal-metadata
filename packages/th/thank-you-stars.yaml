  ===============

  [![GitHub Actions](https://github.com/y-taka-23/thank-you-stars/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/y-taka-23/thank-you-stars/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/thank-you-stars.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/thank-you-stars)

  A tool for starring GitHub repositories. It detects dependent libraries
  which are hosted on GitHub via `.cabal` files,
  and stars the repositories all at once.

  Setup
  -----

  The project is managed by Cabal, so you can install it simply:

  ```console
  $ git clone https://github.com/y-taka-23/thank-you-stars.git
  $ cd thank-you-stars
  $ cabal install --with-compiler ghc-8.10.7
  ```

  To star GitHub repositories, you have to get your personal access token.

  1. Open https://github.com/settings/tokens and press "Generate new token."
  1. Input the description and check only "public_repo" as a scope.
  1. Save the token as `$HOME/.thank-you-stars.json`:

  ```json
  {
      "token": "SET_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
  }
  ```

  Usage
  -----

  Run `thank-you-stars` in the root directory of your project.
  Then it scans all `.cabal` files under the current directory
  and metadata of the packages from the local Hackage DB,
  stars your dependent libraries if they are hosted on GitHub.

  ```console
  $ thank-you-stars
