description: ! '@Thrist@ is a list-like data structure (GADT)

  whose elements are values of a two-parameter

  datatype. The typing constraint ensures that

  the second type parameter of a former value

  unifies with the first type parameter of the

  latter.


  This threading of types is the foundation for

  thrists'' nice properties. E.g., paired with a

  suitable semantics, function composition $(.)$

  can be embedded.


  Technically a thrist is embodying the concept

  of a /free category/.


  Sub-modules demonstrate the power of the thrist

  idea by emulating some familiar data structures.
