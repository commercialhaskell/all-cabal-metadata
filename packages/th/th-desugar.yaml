changelog: ! "`th-desugar` release notes\n==========================\n\nVersion 1.9\n-----------\n*
  Suppose GHC 8.6.\n\n* Add support for `DerivingVia`. Correspondingly, there is now
  a\n  `DDerivStrategy` data type.\n\n* Add support for `QuantifiedConstraints`. Correspondingly,
  there is now a\n  `DForallPr` constructor in `DPred` to represent quantified constraint
  types.\n\n* Remove the `DStarT` constructor of `DType` in favor of `DConT ''Type`.\n
  \ Two utility functions have been added to `Language.Haskell.TH.Desugar` to\n  ease
  this transition:\n\n  * `isTypeKindName`: returns `True` if the argument `Name`
  is that\n    of `Type` or `★` (or `*`, to support older GHCs).\n  * `typeKindName`:
  the name of `Type` (on GHC 8.0 or later) or `*` (on older\n    GHCs).\n\n* `th-desugar`
  now desugars all data types to GADT syntax. The most significant\n  API-facing changes
  resulting from this new design are:\n\n  * The `DDataD`, `DDataFamilyD`, and `DDataFamInstD`
  constructors of `DDec`\n    now have `Maybe DKind` fields that either have `Just`
  an explicit return\n    kind (e.g., the `k -> Type -> Type` in `data Foo :: k ->
  Type -> Type`)\n    or `Nothing` (if lacking an explicit return kind).\n  * The
  `DCon` constructor previously had a field of type `Maybe DType`, since\n    there
  was a possibility it could be a GADT (with an explicit return type)\n    or non-GADT
  (without an explicit return type) constructor. Since all data\n    types are desugared
  to GADTs now, this field has been changed to be simply\n    a `DType`.\n  * The
  type signature of `dsCon` was previously:\n\n    ```haskell\n    dsCon :: DsMonad
  q => Con -> q [DCon]\n    ```\n\n    However, desugaring constructors now needs
  more information than before,\n    since GADT constructors have richer type signatures.
  Accordingly, the type\n    of `dsCon` is now:\n\n    ```haskell\n    dsCon :: DsMonad
  q\n          => [DTyVarBndr] -- ^ The universally quantified type variables\n                          --
  \  (used if desugaring a non-GADT constructor)\n          -> DType        -- ^ The
  original data declaration's type\n                          --   (used if desugaring
  a non-GADT constructor).\n          -> Con -> q [DCon]\n    ```\n\n    The `instance
  Desugar [Con] [DCon]` has also been removed, as the previous\n    implementation
  of `desugar` (`concatMapM dsCon`) no longer has enough\n    information to work.\n\n
  \ Some other utility functions have also been added as part of this change:\n\n
  \ * A `conExistentialTvbs` function has been introduced to determine the\n    existentially
  quantified type variables of a `DCon`. Note that this\n    function is not 100%
  accurate—refer to the documentation for\n    `conExistentialTvbs` for more information.\n\n
  \ * A `mkExtraDKindBinders` function has been introduced to turn a data type's\n
  \   return kind into explicit, fresh type variable binders.\n\n  * A `toposortTyVarsOf`
  function, which finds the free variables of a list of\n    `DType`s and returns
  them in a well scoped list that has been sorted in\n    reverse topological order.\n\n*
  `th-desugar` now desugars partial pattern matches in `do`-notation and\n  list/monad
  comprehensions to the appropriate invocation of `fail`.\n  (Previously, these were
  incorrectly desugared into `case` expressions with\n  incomplete patterns.)\n\n*
  Add a `mkDLamEFromDPats` function for constructing a `DLamE` expression using\n
  \ a list of `DPat` arguments and a `DExp` body.\n\n* Add an `unravel` function for
  decomposing a function type into its `forall`'d\n  type variables, its context,
  its argument types, and its result type.\n\n* Export a `substTyVarBndrs` function
  from `Language.Haskell.TH.Desugar.Subst`,\n  which substitutes over type variable
  binders in a capture-avoiding fashion.\n\n* `getDataD`, `dataConNameToDataName`,
  and `dataConNameToCon` from\n  `Language.Haskell.TH.Desugar.Reify` now look up local
  declarations. As a\n  result, the contexts in their type signatures have been strengthened
  from\n  `Quasi` to `DsMonad`.\n\n* Export a `dTyVarBndrToDType` function which converts
  a `DTyVarBndr` to a\n  `DType`, which preserves its kind.\n\n* Previously, `th-desugar`
  would silently accept illegal uses of record\n  construction with fields that did
  not belong to the constructor, such as\n  `Identity { notAField = \"wat\" }`. This
  is now an error.\n\nVersion 1.8\n-----------\n* Support GHC 8.4.\n\n* `substTy`
  now properly substitutes into kind signatures.\n\n* Expose `fvDType`, which computes
  the free variables of a `DType`.\n\n* Incorporate a `DDeclaredInfix` field into
  `DNormalC` to indicate if it is\n  a constructor that was declared infix.\n\n* Implement
  `lookupValueNameWithLocals`, `lookupTypeNameWithLocals`,\n  `mkDataNameWithLocals`,
  and `mkTypeNameWithLocals`, counterparts to\n  `lookupValueName`, `lookupTypeName`,
  `mkDataName`, and `mkTypeName` which\n  have access to local Template Haskell declarations.\n\n*
  Implement `reifyNameSpace` to determine a `Name`'s `NameSpace`.\n\n* Export `reifyFixityWithLocals`
  from `Language.Haskell.TH.Desugar`.\n\n* Export `matchTy` (among other goodies)
  from new module `Language.Haskell.TH.Subst`.\n  This function matches a type template
  against a target.\n\nVersion 1.7\n-----------\n* Support for TH's support for `TypeApplications`,
  thanks to @RyanGlScott.\n\n* Support for unboxed sums, thanks to @RyanGlScott.\n\n*
  Support for `COMPLETE` pragmas.\n\n* `getRecordSelectors` now requires a list of
  `DCon`s as an argument. This\n  makes it easier to return correct record selector
  bindings in the event that\n  a record selector appears in multiple constructors.
  (See\n  [goldfirere/singletons#180](https://github.com/goldfirere/singletons/issues/180)\n
  \ for an example of where the old behavior of `getRecordSelectors` went wrong.)\n\n*
  Better type family expansion (expanding an open type family with variables works
  now).\n\nVersion 1.6\n-----------\n* Work with GHC 8, with thanks to @christiaanb
  for getting this change going.\n  This means that several core datatypes have changed:
  partcularly, we now have\n  `DTypeFamilyHead` and fixities are now reified separately
  from other things.\n\n* `DKind` is merged with `DType`.\n\n* `Generic` instances
  for everything.\n\nVersion 1.5.5\n-------------\n\n* Fix issue #34. This means that
  desugaring (twice) is idempotent over\nexpressions, after the second time. That
  is, if you desugar an expression,\nsweeten it, desugar again, sweeten again, and
  then desugar a third time, you\nget the same result as when you desugared the second
  time. (The extra\nround-trip is necessary there to make the output smaller in certain
  common\ncases.)\n\nVersion 1.5.4.1\n---------------\n* Fix issue #32, concerning
  reification of classes with default methods.\n\nVersion 1.5.4\n-------------\n*
  Added `expandUnsoundly`\n\nVersion 1.5.3\n-------------\n* More `DsMonad` instances,
  thanks to David Fox.\n\nVersion 1.5.2\n-------------\n* Sweeten kinds more, too.\n\nVersion
  1.5.1\n-------------\n* Thanks to David Fox (@ddssff), sweetening now tries to use
  more of TH's `Type`\nconstructors.\n\n* Also thanks to David Fox, depend usefully
  on the th-orphans package.\n\nVersion 1.5\n-----------\n* There is now a facility
  to register a list of `Dec` that internal reification\n  should use when necessary.
  This avoids the user needing to break up their\n  definition across different top-level
  splices. See `withLocalDeclarations`.\n  This has a side effect of changing the
  `Quasi` typeclass constraint on many\n  functions to be the new `DsMonad` constraint.
  Happily, there are `DsMonad`\n  instances for `Q` and `IO`, the two normal inhabitants
  of `Quasi`.\n\n* \"Match flattening\" is implemented! The functions `scExp` and
  `scLetDec` remove\n  any nested pattern matches.\n\n* More is now exported from
  `Language.Haskell.TH.Desugar` for ease of use.\n\n* `expand` can now expand closed
  type families! It still requires that the\n  type to expand contain no type variables.\n\n*
  Support for standalone-deriving and default signatures in GHC 7.10.\n  This means
  that there are now two new constructors for `DDec`.\n\n* Support for `static` expressions,
  which are new in GHC 7.10.\n\nVersion 1.4.2\n-------------\n* `expand` functions
  now consider open type families, as long as the type\n   to be expanded has no free
  variables.\n\nVersion 1.4.1\n-------------\n* Added `Language.Haskell.TH.Desugar.Lift`,
  which provides `Lift` instances\nfor all of the th-desugar types, as well as several
  Template Haskell types.\n\n* Added `applyDExp` and `applyDType` as convenience functions.\n\nVersion
  1.4.0\n-------------\n* All `Dec`s can now be desugared, to the new `DDec` type.\n\n*
  Sweetening `Dec`s that do not exist in GHC 7.6.3- works on a \"best effort\" basis:\nclosed
  type families are sweetened to open ones, and role annotations are dropped.\n\n*
  `Info`s can now be desugared. Desugaring takes into account GHC bug #8884, which\nmeant
  that reifying poly-kinded type families in GHC 7.6.3- was subtly wrong.\n\n* There
  is a new function `flattenDValD` which takes a binding like\n  `let (a,b) = foo`
  and breaks it apart into separate assignments for `a` and `b`.\n\n* There is a new
  `Desugar` class with methods `desugar` and `sweeten`. See\nthe documentation in
  `Language.Haskell.TH.Desugar`.\n\n* Variable names that are distinct in desugared
  code are now guaranteed to\nhave distinct answers to `nameBase`.\n\n* Added a new
  function `getRecordSelectors` that extracts types and definitions\nof record selectors
  from a datatype definition.\n\nVersion 1.3.1\n-------------\n* Update cabal file
  to include testing files in sdist.\n\nVersion 1.3.0\n-------------\n* Update to
  work with `type Pred = Type` in GHC 7.9. This changed the\n`DPred` type for all
  GHC versions, though.\n\nVersion 1.2.0\n-------------\n* Generalized interface to
  allow any member of the `Qausi` class, instead of\n  just `Q`.\n\nVersion 1.1.1\n-------------\n*
  Made compatible with HEAD after change in role annotation syntax.\n\nVersion 1.1\n-----------\n*
  Added module `Language.Haskell.TH.Desugar.Expand`, which allows for expansion\n
  \ of type synonyms in desugared types.\n* Added `Show`, `Typeable`, and `Data` instances
  to desugared types.\n* Fixed bug where an as-pattern in a `let` statement was scoped
  incorrectly.\n* Changed signature of `dsPat` to be more specific to as-patterns;
  this allowed\n  for fixing the `let` scoping bug.\n* Created new functions `dsPatOverExp`
  and `dsPatsOverExp` to allow for easy\n  desugaring of patterns.\n* Changed signature
  of `dsLetDec` to return a list of `DLetDec`s.\n* Added `dsLetDecs` for convenience.
  Now, instead\n  of using `mapM dsLetDec`, you should use `dsLetDecs`.\n\nVersion
  1.0\n-----------\n\n* Initial release\n"

description: ! '`th-desugar` Package

  ====================


  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/th-desugar.svg)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/th-desugar)

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/goldfirere/th-desugar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/goldfirere/th-desugar)


  This package provides the `Language.Haskell.TH.Desugar` module, which desugars

  Template Haskell''s rich encoding of Haskell syntax into a simpler encoding.

  This desugaring discards surface syntax information (such as the use of infix

  operators) but retains the original meaning of the TH code. The intended use

  of this package is as a preprocessor for more advanced code manipulation

  tools. Note that the input to any of the `ds...` functions should be produced

  from a TH quote, using the syntax `[| ... |]`. If the input to these functions

  is a hand-coded TH syntax tree, the results may be unpredictable. In

  particular, it is likely that promoted datatypes will not work as expected.


  One explicit goal of this package is to reduce the burden of supporting multiple

  GHC / TH versions. Thus, the desugared language is the same across all GHC versions,

  and any inconsistencies are handled internally.


  The package was designed for use with the `singletons` package, so some design

  decisions are based on that use case, when more than one design choice was

  possible.


  I will try to keep this package up-to-date with respect to changes in GHC.
