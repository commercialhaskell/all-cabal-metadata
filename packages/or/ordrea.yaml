description: |-
  This is an FRP library with the following characteristics:

  * classical: it has first-class signals

  * synchronous: it has a clear notion of simultaneous events

  * higher-order: signals inside signals can be flattened
  to get a switching behavior

  * push-based: inactive events has zero runtime costs

  This package is in the alpha stage.
