  # orbits

  *For my uncle Zbys who watched the planets and stars.*

  -----

  Types and functions for dealing with Kepler orbits.

  The main data type is `Orbit`, which describes the path of a body in orbit.

  Note that in the Haskell source uppercase symbols such as Ω and M are written
  with a leading underscore.

  Implementation
  --------------

  This package makes use of the
  [`units`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/units) package to ensure that the
  implementation is correct regarding units of measure.
