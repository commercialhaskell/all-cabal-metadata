  # Changelog

  ## Unreleased

  This release sees the extension of this library to understand heading
  timestamps, TODOs, priorities, and `PROPERTIES` drawers.

  #### Added

  - A number of new timestamp types.
  - `Ord` instances for every type.
  - Functions `allDocTags` and `allSectionTags` for extracting unique `Set`s of
    recursive heading tags.

  #### Changed

  - **Breaking:** `Section` has several new fields involving timestamps and properties.
  - **Breaking:** The `Tags` variant has been removed from the `Words` type.

  #### Fixed

  - Heading tags are properly parsed.

  ## 1.1.1 (2021-04-04)

  #### Fixed

  - Widened `megaparsec` bounds.

  ## 1.1.0 (2020-03-13)

  If you're reading this from the future, everyone is being silly about the Corona
  Virus right now.

  #### Added

  - Support for heading tags, like `:foo:`.

  #### Changed

  - `OrgFile` now contains a raw `Map Text Text` for all metadata key-value pairs.

  #### Removed

  - The `Meta` type has been removed.

  ## 1.0.1 (2020-03-06)

  #### Fixed

  - Fixed broken test suite due to missing files.

  ## 1.0.0 (2020-03-05)

  #### Added

  - Initial version of all types, parsers, and pretty-printers.

  # org-mode

  `org-mode` is a library for parsing text in the [Emacs
  org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) format.

  ## Assumptions

  - File metadata like [In-buffer
    Settings](https://orgmode.org/manual/In_002dbuffer-Settings.html#In_002dbuffer-Settings)
    appears at the top of the file.
  - Special timestamps like `DEADLINE` always appear in the order `CLOSED`,
    `DEADLINE`, then `SCHEDULED` if present together.
  - If there are both a special timestamp and a regular timestamp present, the
    regular timestamp must appear on the next line (this is how Emacs itself
    inserts them).
