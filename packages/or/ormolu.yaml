changelog: |
  ## Ormolu 0.0.5.0

  * Grouping of statements in `do`-blocks is now preserved. [Issue
    74](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/74).

  * Grouping of TH splices is now preserved. [Issue
    507](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/507).

  * Comments on pragmas are now preserved. [Issue
    216](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/216).

  * Ormolu can now be enabled and disabled via special comments. [Issue
    435](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/435).

  * Added experimental support for simple CPP. [Issue
    415](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/415).

  * Added two new options `--start-line` and `--end-line` that allow us to
    select a region to format. [Issue
    516](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/516).

  * Fixed rendering of module headers in the presence of preceding comments or
    Haddocks. [Issue 561](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/561).

  ## Ormolu 0.0.4.0

  * When given several files to format, Ormolu does not stop on the first
    failure, but tries to format all the files. [Issue
    502](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/502).

  * Made rendering of pattern matches involving operators consistent with
    other cases of rendering of operators. [Issue
    500](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/500).

  * More compact rendering of type family injectivity constraints. [Issue
    482](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/482).

  * Improved rendering of the keyword `where` in class, data, and type family
    declarations. When headers of these declarations are multi-line `where` is
    now put on its own line. [Issue
    509](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/509).

  * Fixed the bug pertaining to rendering of arrow notation with multiline
    expressions. [Issue 513](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/513).

  * Made rendering of data type definitions, value-level applications, and
    application of types use the same style. Moreover, existential now doesn't
    cause the data constructor be unconditionally rendered in multiline
    layout. [Issue 427](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/427).

  * Records with a single data constructor are now formatted more compactly.
    [Issue 425](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/425).

  * Switched to `ghc-lib-parser-8.10.1`.

  * Implemented support for the new language extensions `ImportQualifiedPost`
    and `StandaloneKindSignatures`.

  ## Ormolu 0.0.3.1

  * Fixed rendering of record updates with the record dot preprocessor syntax
    [Issue 498](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/498).

  ## Ormolu 0.0.3.0

  * Fixed an issue related to unnecessary use of curly braces. [Issue
    473](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/473).

  * Fixed the issue with formatting multi-way if when it happens to be a
    function applied to arguments [Issue
    488](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/488). This changed the way
    multi-line if is formatted in general.

  * Added support for record dot pre-processor when used via the plugin.
    [Issue 486](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/486).

  * Stopped hanging record constructors and improved placing
    potentially-hanging consturctions in the presence of comments. [Issue
    447](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/447).

  * Fixed indentation in presence of type applications. [Issue
    493](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/493).

  * Class and instance declarations now do not have a blank line after
    `where`. Grouping of methods from the original input is also preserved
    with some normalizations. [Issue
    431](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/431).

  ## Ormolu 0.0.2.0

  * Switched to `ghc-lib-parser` instead of depending on the `ghc` package
    directly. This should allow us to use newest features of GHC while not
    necessarily depending on the newest version of the compiler. In addition
    to that Ormolu is now GHCJS-compatible.

  * Now unrecognized GHC options passed with `--ghc-opt` cause Ormolu to fail
    (exit code 7).

  * Fixed formatting of result type in closed type families. See [issue
    420](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/420).

  * Fixed a minor inconsistency between formatting of normal and foreign type
    signatures. See [issue 408](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/408).

  * Fixed a bug when comment before module header with Haddock was moved
    inside the export list. See [issue
    430](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/430).

  * Empty `forall`s are now correctly preserved. See [issue
    429](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/429).

  * Fixed [issue 446](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/446), which
    involved braces and operators.

  * When there are comments between preceding Haddock (pipe-style) and its
    corresponding declaration they are preserved like this in the output
    instead of being shifted. To be clear, this is not a very good idea to
    have comments in that position because the Haddock will end up not being
    associated with the declarations. Issues
    [440](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/440) and
    [448](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/448).

  * Implemented correct handling of shebangs. [Issue
    377](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/377).

  * Implemented correct handling of stack headers. [Issue
    393](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/393).

  * Sorting language pragmas cannot not change meaning of the input program
    anymore. [Issue 404](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/404).

  * Fixed formatting of applications where function is a complex expression.
    [Issue 444](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu/issues/444).

  Ormolu is a formatter for Haskell source code. The project was created with
  the following goals in mind:

  * Using GHC's own parser to avoid parsing problems caused by
    [`haskell-src-exts`][haskell-src-exts].
  * Let some whitespace be programmable. The layout of the input influences
    the layout choices in the output. This means that the choices between
    single-line/multi-line layouts in each particular situation are made by
    the user, not by an algorithm. This makes the implementation simpler and
    leaves some control to the user while still guaranteeing that the
    formatted code is stylistically consistent.
  * Writing code in such a way so it's easy to modify and maintain.
  * Implementing one “true” formatting style which admits no configuration.
  * That formatting style aims to result in minimal diffs while still
    remaining very close to “conventional” Haskell formatting people use.
  * Choose a style compatible with modern dialects of Haskell. As new Haskell
    extensions enter broad use, we may change the style to accomodate them.
  * Idempotence: formatting already formatted code doesn't change it.
  * Be well-tested and robust to the point that it can be used in large
    projects without exposing unfortunate, disappointing bugs here and there.

  ## Building

  The easiest way to build the project is with Nix:

  ```console
  $ nix-build -A ormolu
  ```

  Or with `cabal-install` from the Nix shell:

  ```console
  $ nix-shell --run "cabal new-build"
  ```

  Alternatively, `stack` could be used with a `stack.yaml` file as follows.

  ```console
  $ cat stack.yaml
  resolver: lts-14.3
  packages:
  - '.'

  $ stack build
  ```

  To use Ormolu directly from GitHub with Nix, this snippet may come in handy:

  ```nix
  # This overlay adds Ormolu straight from GitHub.
  self: super:

  let source = super.fetchFromGitHub {
        owner = "tweag";
        repo = "ormolu";
        rev = "de279d80122b287374d4ed87c7b630db1f157642"; # update as necessary
        sha256 = "0qrxfk62ww6b60ha9sqcgl4nb2n5fhf66a65wszjngwkybwlzmrv"; # as well
      };
      ormolu = import source { pkgs = self; };
  in {
    haskell = super.haskell // {
      packages = super.haskell.packages // {
        "${ormolu.ormoluCompiler}" = super.haskell.packages.${ormolu.ormoluCompiler}.override {
          overrides = ormolu.ormoluOverlay;
        };
      };
    };
  }
  ```

  ## Usage

  The following will print the formatted output to the standard output.

  ```console
  $ ormolu Module.hs
  ```

  Add `--mode inplace` to replace the contents of the input file with the
  formatted output.

  ```console
  $ ormolu --mode inplace Module.hs
  ```

  ## Magic comments

  Ormolu understands two magic comments:

  ```haskell
  {- ORMOLU_DISABLE -}
  ```

  and

  ```haskell
  {- ORMOLU_ENABLE -}
  ```

  This allows us to disable formatting selectively for code between these
  markers or disable it for the entire file. To achieve the latter, just put
  `{- ORMOLU_DISABLE -}` at the very top. Note that the source code should
  still be parseable even without the “excluded” part. Because of that the
  magic comments cannot be placed arbitrary, but should rather enclose
  independent top-level definitions.

  ## Current limitations

  * CPP support is experimental. CPP is virtually impossible to handle
    correctly, so we process them as a sort of unchangeable snippets. This
    works only in simple cases when CPP conditionals are self-contained. Use
    Ormolu with CPP at your own risk.
  * Input modules should be parsable by Haddock, which is a bit stricter
    criterion than just being valid Haskell modules.
  * Various minor idempotence issues, most of them are related to comments.

  ## Editor integration

  We know of the following editor integrations:

  * [Emacs][emacs-package]
  * [VS Code][vs-code-plugin]
  * vim: [neoformat][neoformat], [vim-ormolu][vim-ormolu]

  ## Running on Hackage

  It's possible to try Ormolu on arbitrary packages from Hackage. For that
  execute (from the root of the cloned repo):

  ```console
  $ nix-build -A hackage.<package>
  ```

  Then inspect `result/log.txt` for possible problems. The derivation will
  also contain formatted `.hs` files for inspection and original inputs with
  `.hs-original` extension (those are with CPP dropped, exactly what is fed
  into Ormolu).
