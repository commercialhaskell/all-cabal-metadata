  # Orthotope

  ## Disclaimer

  This is not an officially supported Google product.

  ## Summary

  This is a library for multi-dimensional arrays inspired by APL.

  ### See also
  The orthotope-hmatrix repo contains some more functionality.

  ## Multi-dimensional arrays

  Each array has a number of elements of the same type, and a *shape*. The shape
  can be described by a list of integers that gives the size for each of the
  dimensions. E.g. the array shape `[2,3]` is a 2x3 matrix (2 rows, 3
  columns), and the shape `[]` is a single value (a scalar).
  The number of dimensions is called the *rank* of the array.

  The shape may or may not be part of the type, depending on which version of the
  API you use.

  ## API variants

  The API comes in many variants, depending on how strongly typed it is and what
  the underlying storage is.

  ### Types

  *   `Dynamic`, the shape is not part of the type, but is checked at runtime.
      E.g., `Array Float` is an array of `Float` which can have any shape.

  *   `Ranked`, the rank of the array is part of the type, but the actual sizes of
      the dimensions are checked at runtime. E.g., `Array 2 Float` is the type of
      2-dimensional arrays (i.e., matrices) of `Float`.

  *   `Shaped`, the shape of the array is part of the type and is checked
      statically. E.g., `Array [2,3] Float` is the type of 2x3 arrays of `Float`.

  Converting between these types is cheap since they all share the same underlying
  trepresentation.

  ### Storage

  Each of the type variants has several storage variants, indicated by a suffix of
  the module names.

  *   `G` The generic array type where you can provide your own storage.

  *   `S` Uses `Data.Vector.Storable` for storage.

  *   `U` Uses `Data.Vector.Unboxed` for storage.

  *   ` ` (empty suffix) Uses `Data.Vector` for storage.

  Conversion between different storage types requires copying the data, so it is
  not a cheap operation.

  ## API

  The library API is mostly structural operations, i.e., operations that
  treat the elements in a uniform way.  For more algorithmic operations,
  e.g., matrix multiplication, we suggest using a different library,
  like `hmatrix`.

  ### Examples using `Dynamic`

  Some preliminaries:

  ```
  > import Data.Array.Dynamic
  > import Text.PrettyPrint.HughesPJClass
  > pp = putStrLn . prettyShow
  ```

  An easy way to create an array from a list is to use `fromList`;
  the first argument is the shape of the array.

  ```
  > m = fromList [2,3] [1..6]
  > m
  fromList [2,3] [1,2,3,4,5,6]
  > shapeL m
  [2,3]
  > rank m
  2
  > size m
  6
  ```

  Arrays can be pretty printed.  They are shown in the APL way:
  The innermost dimension on a line, the next dimension vertically,
  the next dimension vertically with an empty line in between, and so on.

  ```
  > pp m
  1 2 3
  4 5 6
  ```

  We can have an arbitrary number of dimensions.

  ```
  > s = fromList [] [42]
  > v = fromList [3] [7,8,9]
  > a = fromList [2,3,4] [1..24]
  > pp s
  42
  > pp v
  7 8 9
  > pp a
   1  2  3  4
   5  6  7  8
   9 10 11 12

  13 14 15 16
  17 18 19 20
  21 22 23 24
  ```

  Indexing into an array removes the outermost dimension of it by selecting a subarray with the given index.

  ```
  > pp $ index v 1
  8
  > shapeL $ index v 1
  []
  > pp $ index a 1
  13 14 15 16
  17 18 19 20
  21 22 23 24
  > pp $ a `index` 1 `index` 2 `index` 0
  21
  ```

  The `scalar` and `unScalar` functions can be used to convert an element to/from and array.
  ```
  > :type scalar 42
  scalar 42 :: Num a => Array a
  > :type index v 1
  index v 1 :: Num a => Array a
  > :type unScalar (index v 1)
  unScalar (index v 1) :: Num a => a
  ```

  The `constant` function makes an array with all identical elements.

  ```
  > pp $ constant [2,3] 8
  8 8 8
  8 8 8
  ```

  Arrays are also instances of `Functor`, `Foldable`, and `Traversable`.

  ```
  > pp $ fmap succ v
   8  9 10
  foldr (+) 0 a
  300
  ```

  The `transpose` operation can be used to rearrange the dimensions of an array.
  The first argument describes how to transpose.

  ```
  > shapeL a
  [2,3,4]
  > shapeL (transpose [1,0,2] a)
  [3,2,4]
  > pp $ transpose [1,0,2] a
   1  2  3  4
  13 14 15 16

   5  6  7  8
  17 18 19 20

   9 10 11 12
  21 22 23 24
  ```

  The `reshape` operation keeps the elements of an array,
  but changes its shape.

  ```
  > pp $ reshape [3,8] a
   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
   9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
  17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
  ```



  ### Similar examples using `Shaped`

  ```
  > import Data.Array.Shaped
  > :set -XDataKinds
  > :set -XTypeApplications
  ```

  The shape is now given by the type.

  ```
  > m :: Array [2,3] Integer; m = fromList [1..6]
  > m
  fromList @[2,3] [1,2,3,4,5,6]
  > shapeL m
  [2,3]
  > rank m
  2
  > size m
  6
  ```

  The type information can be given in different ways.

  ```
  > s :: Array '[] Integer; s = fromList [42]
  > v = fromList [7,8,9] :: Array '[3] Integer
  > m = fromList @[2,3,4] [1..24]
  ```

  There are also numeric instances for shaped arrays.
  They allow pointwise arithmetic on arrays with the same shape.
  Numeric constants are automatically of the right shape.

  ```
  > import Data.Array.Shaped.Instances
  > pp $ v * 2
  14 16 18
  > pp $ a + a
   2  4  6  8
  10 12 14 16
  18 20 22 24

  26 28 30 32
  34 36 38 40
  42 44 46 48
  ```

  What is value arguments for `Dynamic` arrays sometimes turn into type arguments
  for shaped arrays.

  ```
  > pp $ reshape @[3,8] a
   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
   9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
  17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
  ```
