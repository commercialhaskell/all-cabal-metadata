description: |-
  The Origami package consists of a coding pattern for transforming
  heterogenously typed data and Template Haskell macros to support
  the pattern.  It operates in the same problem space as SYB, but
  generates the boilerplate for the user.

  In the pattern, we focus on a specific set of types, the /fold/
  /family/.  For each constructor of each of those types, the user
  will define a function to "replace" the constructor when folding.

  These functions are collected together into a single record.  (Its
  declaration is generated for the user.)  Collecting the functions
  together forces the typing of all the functions to remain
  consistent and facilitates code reuse.

  For each datatype, a fold function is automatically generated that
  applies the fold record to values of that datatype.  It decomposes
  the value into parts according to its constructor, recursively
  applies the fold to the parts, then puts them back together using
  the replacement constructor function from the record.

  As with SYB, Origami lets the user think on a higher-level of
  abstraction about data transformation and relieves her from the
  need to write boilerplate.

  See the website for more information and examples.
