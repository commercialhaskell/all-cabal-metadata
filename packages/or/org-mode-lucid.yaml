  # Changelog

  ## 1.6.0 (2021-04-05)

  #### Added

  - `OrgStyle` now contains the field `bulma :: Bool` for adding
    [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) classes to certain elements.

  #### Changelog

  - Images are now wrapped in a `<figure>` element as well.

  ## 1.5.0 (2020-09-04)

  #### Added

  - `toc` function is now exposed for manually generating an article's associated
    Table of Contents.

  #### Changed

  - Tables of Contents are no longer automatically injected into the `Html`
    produced by the `html` and `body` functions.
  - The `tableOfContents` field of `OrgStyle` is no longer a `Maybe`. It must be
    provided, but can be given any value if you don't intend to call `toc`
    yourself.

  #### Removed

  - The `TOC` type had its `tocTitle :: Text` field removed.

  ## 1.4.0 (2020-07-13)

  #### Added

  - Headers and their contents can now be tweaked on the caller's end with the new
    `OrgStyle` field `sectionStyling`.

  #### Removed

  - The `hrBetweenSections` function has been removed. The same effect can be
    achieved with a custom `SectionStyling`:

  ```haskell
  section :: O.SectionStyling
  section depth h b = do
    h
    b
    when (depth == 1) $ hr_ []
  ```

  ## 1.3.0 (2020-03-24)

  #### Changed

  - `OrgStyle` has been given an extra field, `hrBetweenSections :: Bool`. If
    `True`, rendering will add a `<hr>` between top-level sections.
  - `defaultStyle` has been updated to reflect the above.

  ## 1.2.0 (2020-03-19)

  #### Changed

  - `OrgStyle` has been given an extra field, `separator` for defining what should
    appear between adjacent elements (e.g. spaces between words).
  - `defaultStyle` has been updated to reflect the above.

  ## 1.1.1 (2020-03-13)

  #### Fixed

  - Support for `org-mode-1.1`.

  ## 1.1.0 (2020-03-07)

  #### Changed

  - `OrgStyle` given a new field `highlighting` which allows one to inject
    customized rendering behaviour for Org source blocks. Combined with
    `skylighting-lucid`, this can be used for server-side syntax highlighting.
  - Inlined `<code>` tags resulting from org highlighting with `~~` now also have
    an `org-highlighting` class.

  ## 1.0.1 (2020-03-06)

  #### Fixed

  - A minor rendering bug involving parentheses in lists, tables, and headings.

  ## 1.0.0 (2020-03-05)

  #### Added

  - Initial version of all `Html` conversion functions.

  # ord-mode-lucid

  This is a child library of `org-mode` that allows its types to be converted into
  `Html` structures from the `lucid` library. This allows one to easily parse and
  embed Org content directly into a Lucid-based website.
