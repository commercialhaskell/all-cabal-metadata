synopsis: Krank checks issue tracker link status in your source code
changelog: |
  # Revision history for krank

  ## 0.2.3 -- 2021-07-18

  * #88 krank tries to test files listed by `git ls-files` or `find` by default.
  * #89 support `NO_COLOR`. https://no-color.org/.
  * README is rebranded so it is obvious that `krank` checks for issue tracker / PR links.

  ## 0.2.2 -- 2020-06-30

  * #84 fix build with `unordered-containers` 0.2.11.0
  * #81, new `--version` command line argument

  ## 0.2.1 -- 2020-05-02

  * #76 fix. ignore space in URL
  * Output now includes the issue title.

  ## 0.2.0 -- 2020-04-19

  * GHC 8.10 support
  * Output is more compact and more detailed.
  * Output is now colored (can be disabled with `--no-colors`).
  * Gitlab support. See `--issuetracker-gitlabhost` for host / api key pairs.
  * Huge performance improvement. Parsing a huge codebase should only be a matter
    of a few seconds.
  * Parallel request execution. Requests to the issue tracker host are not
    sequential anymore. This can dramatically reduce the runtime.
  * Ignore line. Add `krank:ignore-line` in your comments and the associated
    closed issue won't be seen as an error anymore.
  * Failure mode: `krank` will return non 0 exit code if an issue is closed (an
    not ignored).

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2019-10-21

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.
  * Support for Github issues tracking

  # Krank

  ![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/krank)

  Krank checks your code source comments for link to issue trackers, such as
  gitlab or github.

  Krank will then outputs a report of the status of theses issues, if they are
  closed or still open.

  # Why

  You are blocked on upstream ticket, there you write a nice comment in your code such as:

  ```python
  # blocked on upstream ticket https//github.com/Foo/Bar/issues/1234
  # This workaround should be removed once the upstream ticket is closed
  if workaround:
    pass
  ```

  And, this stays in your codebase for the next ten years, even if the upstream issue is closed.

  Now you can run `krank` on your codebase, and it will tells you that issue
  `#1234` in project `Foo/Bar` has been closed. Time to remove your workaround.

  # Usage

  Just launch the `krank` command, optionally with a list of files as arguments. It
  works on any kind of source code file and prints a report of
  informations found in the comments:

  ```bash
  $ krank

  default.nix:20:20: info:
    still Open: https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/2733

  foo.hs:67:11: error:
    now Closed: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6313
  ```

  `krank` will fail (i.e. non-zero exit code) in case of any error.

  Here `krank` is telling us that our source code links to github
  issues which are now closed. Time to remove some workarounds now that
  upstream issues are fixed!

  You can check `krank --help` for a list of options, such as
  configuring your API token for external services, such as github and
  gitlab.

  # Specific documentation

  [IssueTracker](docs/Checkers/IssueTracker.md) is listing Github and Gitlab
  issue linked in comment. Issues which are still Open will be listed as info and
  Closed *issues* are listed as *error*. Convenient to know when to remove
  workarounds.

  # Red herring

  If you want to ignore all krank checkers on a given line of code, add `krank:ignore-line` on this
  same line. Krank will then skip this line and not report anything on it

  # Misc

  - Krank is available on
    [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/krank), but you can
    also [build it manually](HACKING.md).
  - If you want to contribute or add a new checker, you can read the
    [Contributions guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) or [open an
    issue](https://github.com/guibou/krank/issues).
