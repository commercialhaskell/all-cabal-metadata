description: "# nvim-hs-ghcid\n\nGhcid integration plugin for [`nvim-hs`](https://github.com/neovimhaskell/nvim-hs).\n\nThis
  plugin fills the quickfix list with location of compiler errors and warnings. Warnings
  are only added to the quickfix list if no errors are present.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nI
  don't know if anyone uses this plugin, but I (saep) have not been using it for years.
  I usually compile it and test it shortly if it stops compiling on stackage, but
  that's about it. It can still be a useful template to write your own plugin as it
  is as complicated as it gets for a plugin.\n\nIf you want to have a development
  environment to program haskell in, try [haskell-language-server](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server)
  which handles different compiler versions and has far more features.\n\n# Installation\n\nYou
  need [stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack) for the automatic compilation
  and starting of the plugin to work.\n\nThen add the plugin and its dependency to
  your `neovim` config file (Example uses [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)):\n\n```viml\nPlug
  'neovimhaskell/nvim-hs.vim'\nPlug 'saep/nvim-hs-ghcid'\n```\n# Usage\n\n> :GhcidStart\n\nTo
  initialize a Ghcid session which will fill the quickfix list on errors/warnings.
  If you add a bang, it will not ask you for the configuration and uses the last saved
  configuration for the project or guesses a configuration.\n\n> :GhcidStop \n\nStop
  the Ghcid session for the project in which the current file resides.\n\n> :GhcidRestart\n\nSame
  as `:GhcidStop` followed by `:GhcidStart!`.\n"
