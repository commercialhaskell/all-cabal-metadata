synopsis: Haskell plugin backend for neovim
changelog: ! "# 0.0.7\n\n* Adjust handling of string sent by neovim in API generation.\n\n#
  0.0.6\n\n* Noteworthy new API functions for the user's convenience:\n\n  - `errOnInvalidResult`\n
  \ - `(:+)`\n\n* ansi-wl-pprint is used for pretty printing of various things now.
  Most\n  notably, the error type has been changed from `String` to `Doc`.\n  This
  is a breaking change, but it was kind of announced in the issues\n  list. In any
  case, uses of `err` can be fixed by enabling the\n  `OverloadedStrings` extension.
  Other breakages have to be fixed by hand.\n\n# 0.0.5\n\n* Documentation received
  some love.\n\n* A few renames of repurposed internals.\n\n# 0.0.3\n\n* Debugging
  facilities for ghci have been added. Check out the\n  `Neovim.Debug` module! These
  few functions are very valuable to debug your\n  code or even the code of nvim-hs
  itself.\n\n* Startup code now has a special `Neovim` environment which has access
  to\n  some of the internals that may or may not be useful. This change allowed\n
  \ the ConfigHelper plugin to be included as a normal, separable plugin.\n  Unfortunately,
  this potentially breaks the plugin startup code of some\n  existing plugins.\n\n*
  Neovim context is no longer a type synonym, but a newtype wrapper around\n  the
  previous type synonym with an added `ResourceT` wrapper. The functions\n  from `MonadReader`
  are now actually exported as those.\n\n  As a consequence, some of your code may
  break if you lack some specific\n  instances which were auto-derived before. Send
  a PR or open a ticket to\n  resolve this.\n\n* Add handling for some kind of variadic
  arguments handling.\n\n  A command or function will be passed `Nothing` as it's\n
  \ last arguments if the argument type is wrapped in `Maybe`\n  and the invocation
  on the side of neovim did not pass those\n  arguments.\n\n# 0.0.2\n\n* Add handling
  for special command options\n\n  This breaks code that used `command` or `command'`
  to export\n  functionality. You should replace the options with a list\n  of `CommandOptions`.\n\n
  \ An export like `$(command' foo) def { cmdSync = Async }` must be redefined\n  to
  `$(command' foo) [CmdSync Async]`.\n\n# 0.0.1\n\n* Usable prototype implementation\n"

  Neovim API for Haskell plugins as well as a plugin provider.

  This library and executable should provide a basis for developing

  plugins. This package should only contain broadly useful interfaces

  to write plugins for neovim in haskell. The design goal is to create

  an easy to use API that avoids most of the boilerplate while still retaining

  some sense of reliability and type safety. Since Template Haskell is used

  to generate the neovim bindings and to avoid some of the boilerplate

  handy work, some exotic operating systems and architectures may not work.

  # What do I have to expect if I were to use it now?


  Check the issue list here on github.


  # How do I start using this?


  All you need to know is inside the

  [Neovim](https://github.com/neovimhaskell/nvim-hs/blob/master/library/Neovim.hs)

  module ([hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/nvim-hs-0.0.5/docs/Neovim.html)).


  # Contributing


  Documentation, typo fixes and alike will almost always be merged.


  If you want to bring forward new features or convenience libraries

  for interacting with neovim, you should create an issue first. The features

  of this (cabal) project should be kept small as this helps

  reducing the development time. (For some tests it is

  necessary to issue `cabal install`, so any change to to a module can

  significantly increase the compilation time.)

  If your idea solves a general problem, feel free to open an issue in the

  library project of nvim-hs:

  [nvim-hs-contrib](https://github.com/neovimhaskell/nvim-hs-contrib)
