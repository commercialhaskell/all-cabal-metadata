  # nvfetcher

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/nvfetcher.svg?logo=haskell)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nvfetcher)
  [![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)
  [![nix](https://github.com/berberman/nvfetcher/actions/workflows/nix.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/berberman/nvfetcher/actions/workflows/nix.yml)

  nvfetcher is a tool to automate nix package updates. It's built on top of [shake](https://www.shakebuild.com/),
  integrating [nvchecker](https://github.com/lilydjwg/nvchecker).
  nvfetcher cli program accepts a TOML file as config, which defines a set of package sources to run.

  ## Overview

  For example, feeding the following configuration to`nvfetcher`:

  ```toml
  # nvfetcher.toml
  [feeluown-core]
  src.pypi = "feeluown"
  fetch.pypi = "feeluown"

  [qliveplayer]
  src.github = "IsoaSFlus/QLivePlayer"
  fetch.github = "IsoaSFlus/QLivePlayer"
  git.fetchSubmodules = true
  ```

  it can create `sources.nix` like:

  ```nix
  # sources.nix
  { fetchgit, fetchurl }:
  {
    feeluown-core = {
      pname = "feeluown-core";
      version = "3.7.7";
      src = fetchurl {
        sha256 = "06d3j39ff9znqxkhp9ly81lcgajkhg30hyqxy2809yn23xixg3x2";
        url = "https://pypi.io/packages/source/f/feeluown/feeluown-3.7.7.tar.gz";
      };
    };
    qliveplayer = {
      pname = "qliveplayer";
      version = "3.22.1";
      src = fetchgit {
        url = "https://github.com/IsoaSFlus/QLivePlayer";
        rev = "3.22.1";
        fetchSubmodules = true;
        deepClone = false;
        leaveDotGit = false;
        sha256 = "00zqg28q5xrbgql0kclgkhd15fc02qzsrvi0qg8lg3qf8a53v263";
      };
    };
  }
  ```

  We tell nvfetcher how to get the latest version number of packages and how to fetch their sources given version numbers,
  and nvfetcher will help us keep their version and prefetched SHA256 sums up-to-date, stored in `_sources/generated.nix`.
  Shake will handle necessary rebuilds as long as you keep `_sources` directory -- we check versions of packages during each run, but only prefetch them when needed.

  ### Live examples

  How to use the generated sources file? Here are several examples:

  * [DevOS](https://github.com/divnix/devos/tree/main/pkgs) - Packages are defined in TOML

  * My [flakes repo](https://github.com/berberman/flakes) - Packages are defined in eDSL

  * Nick Cao's [flakes repo](https://gitlab.com/NickCao/flakes/-/tree/master/pkgs) - Packages are defined in TOML

  ## Installation

  `nvfetcher` package is available in [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs), so you can try it with:

  ```
  $ nix-shell -p nvfetcher
  ```

  This repo also has flakes support:

  ```
  $ nix run github:berberman/nvfetcher
  ```

  To use it as a Haskell library, the package is available on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nvfetcher).
  If you want to use the Haskell library from flakes, there is also a shell `ghcWithNvfetcher`:

  ```
  $ nix develop github:berberman/nvfetcher#ghcWithNvfetcher
  $ runghc Main.hs
  ```

  where you can define packages in `Main.hs`. See [Haskell library](#Haskell-library) for details.

  ## Usage

  Basically, there are two ways to use nvfetcher, where the difference is how we provide package sources definitions to it.

  ### CLI

  To run nvfetcher as a CLI program, you'll need to provide package sources defined in TOML.

  ```
  Available options:
    --version                Show version
    --help                   Show this help text
    -o,--build-dir FILE      Directory that nvfetcher puts artifacts to
                             (default: "_sources")
    --commit-changes         `git commit` changes in this run (with shake db)
    -l,--changelog FILE      Dump version changes to a file
    -j NUM                   Number of threads (0: detected number of processors)
                             (default: 0)
    -r,--retry NUM           Times to retry of some rules (nvchecker, prefetch,
                             nix-instantiate, etc.) (default: 3)
    -t,--timing              Show build time
    -v,--verbose             Verbose mode
    TARGET                   Two targets are available: 1.build 2.clean
                             (default: "build")
    -c,--config FILE         Path to nvfetcher TOML config
                             (default: "nvfetcher.toml")
  ```

  Each *package* corresponds to a TOML table, whose name is encoded as table key, with
  two required fields and three optional fields in each table.
  You can find an example of the configuration file, see [`nvfetcher_example.toml`](nvfetcher_example.toml).

  #### Nvchecker

  Version source -- how do we track upstream version updates?
  * `src.github = owner/repo` - the latest github release
  * `src.github_tag = owner/repo` - the max github tag, usually used with list options (see below)
  * `src.pypi = pypi_name` - the latest pypi release
  * `src.git = git_url` (and an optional `src.branch = git_branch`) - **the latest commit** of a repo
  * `src.archpkg = archlinux_pkg_name` -- the latest version of an archlinux package
  * `src.aur = aur_pkg_name` -- the latest version of an aur package
  * `src.manual = v` -- a fixed version, which never updates
  * `src.repology = project:repo` -- the latest version from repology
  * `src.webpage = web_url` and `src.regex` -- a string in webpage that matches with regex
  * `src.httpheader = request_url` and `src.regex` -- a string in http header that matches with regex
  * `src.openvsx = publisher.ext_name` -- the latest version of a vscode extension from open vsx
  * `src.vsmarketplace = publisher.ext_name` -- the latest version of a vscode extension from vscode marketplace


  Optional list options for some version sources (`src.github_tag`, `src.webpage`, and `src.httpheader`),
  see the corresponding [nvchecker documentation](https://nvchecker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#list-options) for details.
  * `src.include_regex`
  * `src.exclude_regex`
  * `src.sort_version_key`
  * `src.ignored`


  Optional global options for all kinds of version sources,
  see the corresponding [nvchecker documentation](https://nvchecker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#global-options) for details. You can tweak obtained version number using this option, e.g. stripping the prefix `v` or transforming the result by regex.
  * `src.prefix`
  * `src.from_pattern`
  * `src.to_pattern`

  #### Nix fetcher

  How do we fetch the package source if we have the target version number?
  `$ver` is available in string, which will be set to the result of nvchecker.

  * `fetch.github = owner/repo`
  * `fetch.pypi = pypi_name`
  * `fetch.git = git_url`
  * `fetch.url = url`
  * `fetch.openvsx = publisher.ext_name`
  * `fetch.vsmarketplace = publisher.ext_name`


  Optional `nix-prefetch-git` config, which make sense only when the fetcher equals to `fetch.github` or `fetch.git`.
  They can exist simultanesouly.
    * `git.deepClone`
    * `git.fetchSubmodules`
    * `git.leaveDotGit`


  #### Extract src

  Optional *extract src* config, files are extracted into build directory, and then read by `readFile` in generated nix expr.
    * `extract = [ "file_1", "file_2", ...]` - file paths are relative to the source root

  #### Rust support

  `rustPlatform.buildRustPackage` now accepts an attribute [`cargoLock`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/doc/languages-frameworks/rust.section.md#importing-a-cargolock-file) to vendor dependencies from `Cargo.lock`,
  so we can use this instead TOFU `cargoSha256` for Rust packageing. `nvfetcher` supports automating this process,
  extracting the lock file to build and calculating `cargoLock.outputHashes`, as long as you set the config
  * `cargo_lock = cargo_lock_path` - relative to the source root

  #### Passthru

  *passthru* config, an additional set of attrs to be generated.

    * `passthru = { k1 = "v1", k2 = "v2", ... }`

  ### Haskell library

  nvfetcher itsetlf is a Haskell library as well, whereas the CLI program is just a trivial wrapper of the library.
  You can create a Haskell program depending on it directly, by using the `runNvFetcher` entry point.
  In this case, we can define packages in Haskell language, getting rid of TOML constraints.

  You can find an example of using nvfetcher in the library way, see [`Main_example.hs`](Main_example.hs).

  ## Documentation

  For details of the library, documentation of released versions is available on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nvfetcher),
  and of master is on our [github pages](https://nvfetcher.berberman.space).
