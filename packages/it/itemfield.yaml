description: |-
  This module provides a brick Widget that can be used with the brick
  package to handle situations where there are lots of items to
  represent to the user along with a corresponding state for each
  item.  One example of where the itemfield would be used is if there
  are too many elements to reasonably show in a List widget, if those
  elements are divided into groups, and if some status needs to be
  shown for each element.

  In addition, the user can use the cursor keys and space bar to mark
  one or more items (presumably so other code can get the list of
  marked elements and perform a state-changing operation).

  There are two example programs built when the examples flag is True
  (the default): bookcase and workreport.  Running these applications
  should give a better idea of what the itemfield widget is and how it
  can be used.
