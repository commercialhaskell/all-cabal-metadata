description: "\nhmidi: Haskell bindings to the OS level MIDI services\n=====================================================\n\nPartial
  implementation of the MIDI 1.0 standard to communicate with physical \nor virtual
  MIDI devices, eg. MIDI keyboards and synthesizers. \n\nSupported operating systems
  are MacOS and Windows. \nSee also the `alsa-midi` library for similar functionality
  under Linux. \n\nInstallation & Usage\n--------------------\n\nIt should install
  with `cabal` without problems on Mac OS X and Windows. \nLinux is not supported.
  \n\nAs usual, just run the command:\n\n    cabal install \n\nWhen using the library,
  you *have* to link against the threaded runtime\n(otherwise random crashes *will*
  occur); for example:\n\n    ghc --make -threaded -O monitor.hs\n\nExample applications\n--------------------\n\nThere
  are some example command line applications in the `examples` subdirectory:\n\n*
  `monitor.hs` - very basic MIDI monitor\n* `chords.hs` - convert NoteOn messages
  to simple chords\n* `playmidi.hs` - play simple `.mid` files on General MIDI compatible
  synths\n* `osx_host.hs` - create a MIDI host (as opposed to connecting to existing
  host). Only works on MacOs.\n\nYou can build them with `ghc --make -threaded` like
  above.\n\nDifferences between Windows and MacOS\n-------------------------------------\n\nWe
  tried to create a unified Haskell API, but there are still differences between\nthe
  Windows and Mac implementations. In particular, you cannot create MIDI hosts\non
  Windows.\n\n"
