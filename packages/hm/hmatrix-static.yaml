description: |-
  A thin, lightweight wrapper over hmatrix to support
  static checking of matrix and vector sizes (for instance,
  addition of different-sized vectors will be disallowed
  at compile-time).

  Objects whose sizes are not statically known are given
  the special size 'Unknown', which allows a syntactically
  cheap way to step down to the statically unchecked system
  of hmatrix. This is cheap in comparison to representing
  unknown sizes with exisential types, which forces pervasive
  continuation passing style.

  WARNING: when using the QuasiQuoting in this package,
  be aware of infix expressions. See the note in
  "Data.Packed.Static.Syntax" for details.
