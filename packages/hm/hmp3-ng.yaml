  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/hmp3-ng.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hmp3-ng)
  ![Build status](https://github.com/galenhuntington/hmp3-ng/actions/workflows/haskell.yml/badge.svg)

  ##  hmp3-ng

  The `hmp3` music player, written in Haskell, dates to 2005, and has a
  curses interface for use in a text terminal.  However, it has become
  abandonware: the last update was in June 2008, and it no longer builds
  with today’s Haskell and standard libraries.

  This repository is an effort to resurrect this software.

  The original Darcs repo has vanished from the Internet.  However, I
  have a copy I checked out in 2008 (to hack on!) with all the patches
  through version 1.5.1 (the latest is 1.5.2.1), and Hackage has tarballs
  for the later versions.

  *  I used [darcs-to-git](https://github.com/purcell/darcs-to-git) to
  port to Git.  I manually added commits for the two later published
  versions, which were only minor changes, mostly the automated
  regeneration of a `configure` file (now gone).

  *  The code has been updated to compile under recent GHC (currently
  8.6, 8.8, 8.10, 9.0, and 9.2) and libraries.  This required rewriting
  or entirely replacing large sections, mainly low-level optimizations.

  *  I added support for building with Stack.

  *  There is a public GitHub issue tracker, and a GitHub action to
  continuously test builds.

  *  I try to avoid “Not Invented Here” by using established,
  up-to-date packages from Hackage.  Much old code has now been
  “outsourced” and simplified.

  *  All C code is removed, replaced with libraries from Hackage.
  There is still some use of the FFI.

  *  Unicode is supported in titles and filenames, and Unicode glyphs
  are utilized in the interface.

  *  It is much more stable.  The app used to crash frequently and
  require restart, but I’ve had `hmp3-ng` running multiple times
  continuously for more than a year with heavy use without any problems.

  *  Several additions and changes have been made to the feature set
  and the UI.  A few of the key bindings have been modified per my
  preference.

  *  Work on other features and changes, and documentation, is ongoing.

  This is still a work in progress.  Let me know if there are problems.


  ##  Installation

  Either `cabal install` or `stack install` will build a binary.
  You will need to have `mpg321` installed, which is free software
  and widely available in package managers.  Alternatively, `mpg123`
  can be used by compiling with the `-DMPG123` option, but, while your
  mileage may vary, in my experience it doesn’t work as well.

  The build depends on the package `hscurses`, which in turn requires
  curses dev files.  In Ubuntu/Debian, for example, these can be
  obtained by installing `libncurses5-dev`.  You probably also need
  `libncursesw5-dev`.


  ##  Use

  The `hmp3` executable is invoked with a list of mp3 files or
  directories of mp3 files.  With no arguments, it will use the
  playlist from the last time it was run, which is stored in an XDG
  cache directory, usually `~/.cache/hmp3/playlist.db`.

  ```
  $ hmp3 ~/Music ~/Downloads/La-La.mp3
  $ hmp3
  ```

  Once running, `hmp3` is controlled by fairly intuitive key commands.
  `h` shows a help menu, and `q` quits.  `hmp3 -h` prints a simple help
  message with command line options.

  A color scheme can be specified by writing out a `Config { .. }`
  value in `~/.config/hmp3/style.conf` or the equivalent in your
  XDG config directory.  See `Style.hs` for the definition.  The `l`
  command hot-reloads this configuration.
