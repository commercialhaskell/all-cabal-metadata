description: "\n            hmp3 : an ncurses mp3 player written in Haskell\n          ---------------------------------------------------\n\nDependencies:\n
  \   mpg321    http://mpg321.sourceforge.net/\n\nBuilding:\n    $ chmod +x configure
  Setup.hs\n    $ ./Setup.hs configure --prefix=/home/dons\n    $ ./Setup.hs build\n
  \   $ ./Setup.hs install\n\nThis assumes you have Cabal installed. Cabal is installed
  by default\nwith newer GHCs. If your Cabal version is too old (v1.0 that comes with\nGHC
  6.4.1 is too old), or if you see:\n      dist/build/hmp3-tmp/cbits/utils.o: No such
  file or directory\nerrors, then you need to download a newer Cabal version first.\n\nUse:\n
  \   To populate a playlist, and start:\n\n    $ hmp3 ~/mp3/dir/\n     or\n    $
  hmp3 a.mp3 b.mp3\n\n    From then on this playlist is saved in ~/.hmp3db, and is
  reloaded\n    automatically, if you restart hmp3 with no arguments.\n\n    $ hmp3\n\n
  \   Type 'h' to display the help page. The other commands are explained\n    on
  the help screen, which can be accessed by typing 'h'. Quit with\n    'q'.\n\nConfiguration:\n\n
  \   Colours may be configured at runtime by editing the \"~/.hmp3\" file.\n    An
  example would be:\n\n        Config { \n                 hmp3_window      = (\"brightwhite\",
  \"black\")\n               , hmp3_helpscreen  = (\"black\",       \"cyan\")\n               ,
  hmp3_titlebar    = (\"green\",       \"blue\")\n               , hmp3_selected    =
  (\"brightwhite\", \"black\")\n               , hmp3_cursors     = (\"black\",       \"cyan\")\n
  \              , hmp3_combined    = (\"black\",       \"cyan\")\n               ,
  hmp3_warnings    = (\"brightwhite\", \"red\")\n               , hmp3_blockcursor
  = (\"black\",       \"darkred\")\n               , hmp3_progress    = (\"cyan\",
  \       \"white\")\n             }\n\n    After editing this file, hit 'l' to have
  the changes used by hmp3.\n\n    The keymaps are configurable by adding your own
  bindings to\n    Config.hs (as are the colours). Edit this file before compilation.\n\n
  \   Alternatively, you can switch between dark and light settings without\n    recompiling.
  If you have a light xterm, set HMP_HAS_LIGHT_BG=true in\n    your shell, and hmp3
  will use the light color settings by default.\n\nLimitations:\n    It only plays
  mp3 files (and variants supported by mpg{321,123}.\n    So no ogg files for now.
  This is on the todo list though.\n\n    It is possible to use mpg123, however it
  appears to be more error\n    prone, and less stable than mpg321.\n\nPlatforms and
  portability:\n    hmp3 has been confirmed to work on:\n        OpenBSD/x86\n        Linux/x86\n
  \       FreeBSD/x86\n        Linux/ppc\n        MacOSX/ppc\n        Irix/mips64\n\n
  \   * You need -threaded.\n\n    * On platforms without a native code generator,
  you should remove the\n    reference to -fasm in the hmp3.cabal file\n\nLicense:\n
