  Description:

  Hmpf is an MPD client designed to play music on a Home Theatre PC.
  The PC should have an infrared remote and VDU display.

  Hmpf allows a large music collection to be browsed with a standard remote.
  It also contains a LastFM client to update your listening history to the LastFM
  servers. Finally, as a last touch Hmpf is able to dynamically generate new entries
  for a playlist based on style of tracks already selected.

  Dependencies:

  Hmpf relies on a running MPD server, LIRC and LCDProc.

  Configuration:

  Hmpf is configured by a configuration file that is expected to be place at /etc/hmpf.conf
  Look at the sample configuration for more details.

  To Do:

  Hmpf works nicely for me and seems fairly robust. However, more documentation
  of the source files is required. The  code which manages the display also
  assumes a 2 x 16 display window. Finally, the way the input code is organised
  it is fairly specific to the LIRC configuration I have chosen for my reomte. If
  any interest is shown in the application I might rectify these shortcomings.


  Hope you enjoy it.
