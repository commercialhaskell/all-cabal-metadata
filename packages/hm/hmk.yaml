description: |-
  Clone of Plan9's mk command, said to have \"improved on make by
  removing all the vowels from the name\". Most features of mk
  are implemented, including basic meta-rules support and
  concurrent execution of jobs.

  The library exports a generic dependency graph traversal that
  can be used independently of the rest.

  The documentation is embedded in the literate Haskell source.

  /Note:/ the library portion is released to the /public domain/.
  Those source files that are not part of the library
  are released under GPLv3 or later.
