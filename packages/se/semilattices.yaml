description: ! '# `semilattices`


  This Haskell package defines typeclasses for join- and meet-semilattices, and for
  upper and lower bounds, and a variety of instances for each.



  ## Usage


  Semilattices are idempotent commutative semigroups, and come in two flavours: `Join`
  and `Meet`. This presentation of them doesn’t inherit from `Semigroup` however,
  since `Semigroup`s already exist and the relationships between the various classes
  here warrant their own operators.


  Join semilattices can be combined using the `\/` operator (pronounced “lub,” for
  “least upper bound”). Meet semilattices can be combined with the `/\` operator (pronounced
  “glb,” for “greatest lower bound”). They have opposite relationships to `Lower`
  and `Upper` bounds (which are optional; in general, there are more lower bounds
  than upper ones).



  ## Related work


  - [`lattices`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lattices) also offers join & meet
  semilattices, & their respective bounds. Relative to `lattices`, `semilattices`
  primarily offers a different class hierarchy, e.g. `Lower` & `Upper` do not have
  `Join` & `Meet` as superclasses. Relative to `semilattices`, `lattices` offers classes
  for lattices (both bounded and un-), partial orderings, a variety of operations
  for instances.
