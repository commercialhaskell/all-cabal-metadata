description: ! '# servant-http2-client


  This package provides a way to generate HTTP2 client code from

  [Servant](http://haskell-servant.github.io/) API descriptions.


  Please consider this package somewhat unstable. The author would appreciate

  feedbacks and benchmarks in real-world deployments.


  ## Usage


  The usage is pretty similar to `servant-client` but uses an HTTP2Client rather

  than a Manager. See also the section below to highlight differences between

  `servant-client` and `servant-http2-client`.


  HTTP2 uses a flow-control mechanism, which `http2-client` exposes but

  `servant-http2-client` hides: as a client you have nothing to do and

  DATA-credit is immediately sent to the server. This mechanism is easy for the

  user but effectively disables flow control at the application level. Further,

  this easy-to-use mechanism may have some slight overhead for sending many small

  control frames. Future version of the library will expose more control points

  (at an increased cost).


  You can find a full example at `./test/Spec.hs` .


  ## Differences with servant-client


  The client leverages `http2-client` and hence behave slightly differently from

  `servant-client`, which uses `http-client`. Most notably, HTTP/2 uses a single

  TCP connection for performing concurrent requests, whereas HTTP/1.x at best

  pipelines request sequentially over a same connection.


  The `servant-client` library uses a connection Manager to create new TCP

  connections or try re-using existing connections. This `servant-http2-client`

  makes no use of such a Manager. This difference is mostly important for

  load-balancing and unstable network environments. When targeting a

  load-balanced server, a `servant-http2-client` will always hit the same

  TCP-endpoint whereas a `servant-client` may hit different TCP-endpoint for each

  request. Also, after handling a connection error, a `servant-client` will open

  a new TCP connection without any decision from the programmer. Conversely, a

  broken `servant-http2-client` will be of no practical use and the programmer

  must create a new H2ClientEnv. A Manager abstraction may be added to

  `http2-client` later.


  The `servant-client` package offers Cookies handling, whereas

  `servant-http2-client` has no such feature. Please consider opening a

  pull-request for adding the support.


  Finally, it''s always good to remember that HTTP2 allows concurrent queries,

  that is, many API calls may fail when a single TCP connection dies out.
