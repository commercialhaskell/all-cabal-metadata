synopsis: Align and Zip type-classes from the common Semialign ancestor.
changelog: |
  # 1.1

  - Split `Semialign` into `Semialign` and `Zip`.
  - Rename old `Zip` into `Repeat`
  - i.e. current main hierarchy is
  - Remove `malign`, use `salign` or `alignWith mappend` where `Monoid` is necessary.
  - Add `Option` instances

  ```haskell
  instance Functor f => Semialign f where
      alignWith :: (These a b -> c) -> f a -> f b -> f c

  instance Semialign f => Align f where
      nil :: f a

  instance Semialign f => Zip f where
      zipWith :: (a -> b -> c) -> f a -> f b -> f c

  instance Zip f => Repeat f where
      repeat :: a -> f a
  ```

  This biased choice, that `Semialign` is a super-class of `Zip` is motivated by the fact that
  - There's no `Semialign`-like class anywhere else, yet
  - `Zip` and `Repeat` are `Apply` (from `semigroupoids`) and `Applicative` with slightly more laws. I
    If you need only `Repeat` class, and your type isn't `Aling`able, maybe using `Applicative` is enough?

description: |-
  The major use of @These@ of this is provided by the @align@ member of
  @Semialign@ class, representing a generalized notion of "zipping with padding"
  that combines structures without truncating to the size of the smaller input.

  It turns out that @zip@ operation fits well the @Semialign@ class,
  forming lattice-like structure.
