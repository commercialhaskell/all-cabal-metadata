  # Revision history for servant-github-webhook

  ## 0.4.2.0  -- 2019-08-21

  * Add some more Reflect instances

  ## 0.4.1.0  -- 2018-04-07

  * Include integration with github-webhooks package.
  * Code is adjusted for backwards-compatibility with GHC 7.10.
  * `HasServer` instances are updated for servant-0.13 or later, due to `hoistServerWithContext`.

  ## 0.4.0.0  -- 2018-02-03

  * Use constant-time equality to check signatures.
  * Add dynamic key capabilities.

  ## 0.3.2.0  -- 2017-12-25

  * Support GHC 8.2 / `base` 4.10.
  * Bump up version bound for `github` to 0.18.

  ## 0.3.1.0  -- 2017-08-06

  * Drop support for GHC <8.
  * Drop support for Servant <0.11.
  * Switch from Crypto package to cryptonite package.
  * Now servant-github-webhook builds with stack.

  ## 0.3.0.0  -- 2016-09-22

  * Pass reflected key index to the handler function for GitHubSignedReqBody.
    This allows for more generic handler functions, as they can determine
    programmatically which repository they are responding to.

  ## 0.2.0.1  -- 2016-09-13

  * Improve documentation (formatting and typos) and examples (remove unnecessary
    verbosity).

  ## 0.2.0.0  -- 2016-09-11

  * Generalize `GitHubSignedReqBody` combinator to `GitHubSignedReqBody''` to
    allow for configuring multiple signing keys, on a per-route basis.
  * Make `GitHubKey` take a function instead of simply an `IO` action.
  * Reexport `KProxy`, to make writing `Demote'` instances easier.

  ## 0.1.0.0  -- 2016-09-10

  Initial release.

  * Implement `GitHubSignedReqBody` combinator for automatic signature
    verification during routing.
  * Implement `GitHubEvent` combinator for dispatching to routes based on the
    webhook type.
  * Known issue: only one global `GitHubKey` can be used across all routes.

  This library facilitates writing Servant routes that can safely act as GitHub
  webhooks.

  Features:

    * Dispatching to routes based on the type of repository event.
    * Automatic verification of request signatures.
    * Route protection expressed in the type system, so webhook routes and
      regular routes cannot be confused.

  Why use servant-github-webhook?
  -------------------------------

  A webhook server needs to be publicly hosted. How can legitimate requests sent
  by GitHub be distinguished from (malicious) requests sent by other clients?

  When a webhook is configured on a repository, a *secret key* is added. This key
  is used by GitHub to compute a *signature* of the request body that it sends;
  this signature is included in the request headers. The routing combinators in
  servant-github-webhook compute the signature of the received request body using
  the same key, and check that the signature in the request headers matches. If
  it does, then the request is legitimate.
