  All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

  and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

  ## [0.3.2] - 2021-12-27
  - Add two new functions, `dijkstraAssoc` and `aStarAssoc`. These allow for the simultaneous
    computation of neighboring states and their costs. (Thank you to
    [nagydani](https://github.com/nagydani))

  ## [0.3.1] - 2010-08-19
  - Dependencies version bump

  ## [0.3.0] - 2017-11-29
  ### Added
  - Monadic versions of search algorithms and helper functions

  ## [0.2.0] - 2017-05-13
  ### Changed
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Simplified return type of `dijkstra` and `aStar`.
    - This should make these functions more ergonomic.
    - Introduced new `incrementalCosts` function to compensate.
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Replaced searches' `prunes` arguments with `pruning` combinator.
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Split searches' `next` arguments into multiple arguments for `dijkstra` and `aStar`.
    - This should make these functions more ergonomic.
  - `next` arguments now only require a way of generating `Foldable`s, instead of lists specifically.

  # search-algorithms
  Haskell library containing common graph search algorithms

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/devonhollowood/search-algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/devonhollowood/search-algorithms)

  Lots of problems can be modeled as graphs, but oftentimes one doesn't want to use an explicit graph structure to represent the problem. Maybe the graph would be too big (or is infinite), maybe making an explicit graph is unwieldy for the problem at hand, or maybe one just wants to generalize over graph implementations. That's where this library comes in: this is a collection of generalized search algorithms, so that one doesn't have to make the graphs explicit. In general, this means that one provides each search function with a function to generate neighboring states, possibly some functions to generate additional information for the search, a predicate which tells when the search is complete, and an initial state to start from. The result is a path from the initial state to a "solved" state, or `Nothing` if no such path is possible.

  ## Documentation
  Documentation is hosted on [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/search-algorithms).

  ## Acknowledgements
  This library shares a similar functionality with the [astar](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/astar) library (which I was unaware of when I released the first version of this library). `astar`'s interface has since influenced the development of this library's interface, and this library owes a debt of gratitude to `astar` for that reason.


  ## Examples
  ### Change-making problem
  ```haskell
  import Algorithm.Search (bfs)

  countChange target = bfs (add_one_coin `pruning` (> target)) (== target) 0
    where
      add_one_coin amt = map (+ amt) coins
      coins = [1, 5, 10, 25]

  -- countChange gives the subtotals along the way to the end:
  -- >>> countChange 67
  -- Just [1, 2, 7, 17, 42, 67]
  ```

  ### Simple directed acyclic graph:
  ```haskell
  import Algorithm.Search (dfs)
  import qualified Data.Map as Map

  graph = Map.fromList [
    (1, [2, 3]),
    (2, [4]),
    (3, [4]),
    (4, [])
    ]

  -- Run dfs on the graph:
  -- >>> dfs (graph Map.!) (== 4) 1
  -- Just [3,4]
  ```

  ### Using A* to find a path in an area with a wall:
  ```haskell
  import Algorithm.Search (aStar)

  taxicabNeighbors :: (Int, Int) -> [(Int, Int)]
  taxicabNeighbors (x, y) = [(x, y + 1), (x - 1, y), (x + 1, y), (x, y - 1)]

  isWall :: (Int, Int) -> Bool
  isWall (x, y) = x == 1 && (-2) <= y && y <= 1

  taxicabDistance :: (Int, Int) -> (Int, Int) -> Int
  taxicabDistance (x1, y1) (x2, y2) = abs (x2 - x1) + abs (y2 - y1)

  findPath :: (Int, Int) -> (Int, Int) -> Maybe (Int, [(Int, (Int, Int))])
  findPath start end =
    let next = taxicabNeighbors
        cost = taxicabDistance
        remaining = (taxicabDistance end)
    in aStar (next `pruning` isWall) cost remaining (== end) start

  -- findPath p1 p2 finds a path between p1 and p2, avoiding the wall
  -- >>> findPath (0, 0) (2, 0)
  -- Just (6,[(0,1),(0,2),(1,2),(2,2),(2,1),(2,0)])
  --
  -- This correctly goes up and around the wall
  ```
