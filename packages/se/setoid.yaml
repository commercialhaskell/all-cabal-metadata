description: "# Setoid\n\nA Haskell implementation of [setoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setoid)
  - a\nset equipped with an equivalence relation. Setoid is a useful data structure
  in\ncases where equivalence is chosen not to be equality. One can use it to\ninfluence
  the memberships of the elements more strictly, as opposed to sets, and\nrun computations
  on unions when conflicts between elements are found.\n\nFor more in-depth explanations
  and examples, please have a look at the\ndocumentation on hackage.\n\n### Copyright:\n*
