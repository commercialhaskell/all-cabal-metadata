description: "An example of code to \"securely\" remove a file from media by over-writing\r\nthe
  file several times with random data, and then erasing it.\r\n\r\nNote that this
  is just an example intended to show that one can write\r\nsystem utilities in Haskell
  instead of, say, C. It does not, for example,\r\nguarantee that the underlying OS/FS
  will be writing the random data over\r\nexactly the same blocks. (In hindsight,
  perhaps making this not be the best\r\nexample. Living and learning, here.)\r\n"
