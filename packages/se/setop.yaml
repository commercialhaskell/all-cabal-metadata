description: ! '* Setop: Perform set operations on files

  ** Rationale


  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)#Basic_operations][Set operations]]
  are a convenient solution to common problems:


  - create a list of tasks without duplicates (set union)

  - filter tasks done out of tasks to do (set difference)

  - find common elements in a database (set intersection)

  - and remove theses elements (set symmetric difference)


  Setop helps you run these set operations on your files.


  ** Usage


  Let''s introduce two line-separated files: =A.txt= and =B.txt=.


  =A.txt= contains all numbers from 0 to 5 included

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

  0

  1

  2

  3

  4

  5

  #+END_EXAMPLE


  =B.txt= contains all even numbers from 0 to 8 included

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

  0

  2

  4

  6

  8

  #+END_EXAMPLE


  *** Set Union (U/Union):


  #+BEGIN_SRC bash

  $ setop A.txt U B.txt

  0

  1

  2

  3

  4

  5

  6

  8

  #+END_SRC`


  *** Set Difference (D/Diff):


  #+BEGIN_SRC bash

  $ setop A.txt D B.txt

  1

  3

  5

  #+END_SRC`


  *** Set Intersection (I/Inter):


  #+BEGIN_SRC bash

  $ setop A.txt I B.txt

  0

  2

  4

  #+END_SRC`


  *** Set Symmetric Difference (J/Disj):


  #+BEGIN_SRC bash

  $ setop A.txt J B.txt

  1

  3

  5

  6

  8

  #+END_SRC`


  *** Reading A.txt from STDIN:


  #+BEGIN_SRC bash

  $ cat A.txt | setop STDIN Diff B.txt

  0

  2

  4

  #+END_SRC`


  *** Reading B.txt from STDIN:


  #+BEGIN_SRC bash

  $ cat B.txt | setop A.txt Disj STDIN

  1

  3

  5

  6

  8

  #+END_SRC`


  ** Notes


  - the resulting set is *sorted in ascending order*

  - some set operations are *not commutative* (e.g. A Diff B /= B Diff A)

  - Setop is based on [[https://github.com/pcapriotti/optparse-applicative][optparse-applicative]]
  and supports [[https://github.com/pcapriotti/optparse-applicative#bash-zsh-and-fish-completions][bash/fish/zsh
  completions]]
