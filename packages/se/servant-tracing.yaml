description: ! "# servant-tracing\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ChrisCoffey/haskell-opentracing-light.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ChrisCoffey/haskell-opentracing-light)\n\nThis
  repository is the minimum required for publishing trace data to Zipkin or Jaeger.
  It adheres to the [Open Tracing Standard] (https://github.com/opentracing/specification/blob/master/specification.md)
  but is not complete. See the documentation on Hackage for module-level details.\n\n\n###
  Using the library\n\nThe OpenTracing standard revolves around a single function,
  `recordSpan`. `recordSpan` is responsible for creating new spans (see the standard
  for the definition of a span) and ensuring child spans use the new id. In order
  to properly build this tree of calls library users must provide the necessary environment
  via a `MonadTracer` instance (see haddocks). Library users are responsible for defining
  their own publish loop. There is a default `Zipkin` publisher in `Tracing.Zipkin`
  which works with Jaeger & Zipkin, but the loop to drain the `spanBuffer` must be
  provided by the user.\n\n```\nfoo :: (MonadIO m, MonadTracer m) =>\n    Int\n    ->
  m String\nfoo str = recordSpan\n    Nothing\n    [Tag \"Ultimate Answer to Life,
  The Universe and Everything\", Tag 42]\n    \"Compute Ultimate Question\"\n    $
  pure \"Oops\"\n```\n\nThe code above logs a new span to the `spanBuffer`, where
  it will sit until published. If it turns out that `foo` is called from an active
  span, then it will be recorded as a child of said higher span.\n\n### Testing Locally
  with the Demo App\n\nYou can start up a compatible server for (Zipkin)[] or (Jaeger)[]
  via a standalone docker container. From there its a matter of seting the following
  environment variables:\n- *TRACING_ENDPOINT*: a `String` with the fully url to a
  running tracing server\n- *TRACING_SERVICE*: a `String` name for your service\n\n\n####
  Pending Features\n- Concurrent tracing support.\n- Thrift support\n- Additional
  clients\n- Pluggable samplers\n"
