description: ! 'This package presents a static library to enforce

  /Information-Flow Control/ (IFC) in Haskell.

  IFC allows untrusted code to manipulate sensitive

  data (i.e., secret information), while preserving its confidentiality.


  To illustrate the use case scenario for /SecLib/, let us consider two Haskell

  programmers , Alice and Bob, who do not trust each other. Image that Alice

  wishes to use Bob''s code to check the strength of Alice''s sensitive passwords.

  Clearly, Alice is concern that the passwords could be leaked if they are run

  with Bob''s code. How could Alice be sure that Bob''s code will preserve the

  confidentiality of Alice''s password? One option is to do code review---a very

  time consuming approach. Instead, Alice demands that Bob''s code uses the

  security monads provided by this library (i.e., ''Sec'' and ''SecIO''). Now, Alice

  only requires, by using the type-system, that Bob''s code is written using such

  monads. Importantly, Alice needs to use Safe Haskell to compile Bob''s

  untrusted code using the flags @-XSafe@. This package provides the files

  @Alice.hs@ and @Bob.hs@. The former calls into functions provided by the

  latter and the library guarantees that secrets are not unintentionally or

  maliciously leaked.


  The library is a modern and simplified version (updated to exploit the last

  GHC type-system features) of the work presented in

  /A Library for Light-weight Information-Flow Security in Haskell/ by

  Alejandro Russo, Koen Claessen and

  John Hughes. In Proc. of the ACM SIGPLAN 2008 Haskell Symposium. With respect

  to the version 1.0.0.0, this version has less side-effectful features (e.g.,

  no secure file handlers and sockets) as well as declassification combinators. However,

  it presents a simpler and more intuitive interface which can be easily

  extended to cover a rich-set of side-effects.'
