  # servant-xml

  Servant support for XML.

  Types with a `ToXml` instance will be automatically marshalled into XML
  and successfully returned by Servant endpoints.
  Types with a `FromXml` instance can be decoded from request bodies.

  In implementing these typeclass instances, you can use the primatives
  found in the `xmlbf` library.
