  Seonbi changelog
  ================

  Version 0.3.4
  -------------

  To be released.


  Version 0.3.3
  -------------

  Released on September 9, 2022.

   -  Updated the *Standard Korean Language Dictionary* data
      (*data/ko-kr-stdict.tsv*) to the revision 2022-09.
   -  Fixed a bug that Sino-Korean words are not phoneticized to Korean custom
      readings (習慣音) according to folk readings (俗音) and erroneous
      readings (訛音).  Now such words are phoneticized to the most usual readings
      according to *Standard Korean Language Dictionary*.  For example,
      *困難* is no more phoneticized to *곤난* but *곤란* instead. [[#22]]

  [#22]: https://github.com/dahlia/seonbi/issues/22


  Version 0.3.2
  -------------

  Released on August 11, 2022.

   -  HTTP API now allows any headers from cross-origin.  (Previously, it allowed
      only `Content-Type`.)
   -  HTTP API now respond with header `Vary: Origin` for more accurate cache
      control.


  Version 0.3.1
  -------------

  Released on November 27, 2021.

   -  Added prebuilt executable binaries for Apple Silicon (macos-arm64).


  Version 0.3.0
  -------------

  Released on November 18, 2021.

   -  Since this version, it requires GHC 8.8.* at least, and supports GHC 9.0.*
      at most.

   -  Now supports several content types besides HTML/XHTML.  The below list
      shows all supported content types:  [[#18]]

       -  `text/html` (previously non-XHTML mode)
       -  `application/xhtml+xml` (previously XHTML mode)
       -  `text/plain` (added)
       -  `text/markdown` (added)

      The below Haskell APIs changed:

       -  Added `Text.Seonbi.ContentTypes` module.
       -  Added `contentType` field for `Configuration m a`.
       -  Removed `xhtml` field for `Configuration m a` in favor of
          new `contentType` field for the same type.

      The below CLI options changed:

       -  Added `-t`/`--content-type` option with the default value `text/html`.
       -  Removed Removed `-x`/`--xhtml` option in favor of new
          `-t`/`--content-type` option.  In order to use XHTML mode, give it
          `-t application/xhtml+xml` option.

      The below HTTP APIs changed:

       -  Added a mandatory field `"content"` to requests.
       -  Deprecated the `"sourceHtml"` field of requests in favor of the new
          `"content"` field.
       -  Added an optional field `"contentType"` with the default value
          `"text/html"` to requests.
       -  Deprecated the `"xhtml"` field of requests in favor of the new
          `"contentType"` field.  The legacy field will be gone in the next
          minor release.
          In order to use XHTML mode, configure `"contentType"` field with
          `"application/xhtml+xml"`.
       -  Added `"content"` field to responses.
       -  Deprecated the `"resultHtml"` field of responses in favor of the new
          `"content"` field.  The legacy field is not provided for non-HTML
          types, and will be gone in the next minor release.
       -  Added `"contentType"` field to responses.
       -  Added `"warnings"` field to responses.

   -  Added `Text.Seonbi.Html.Lang` module.

   -  Some transformations inappropriate for non-Korean contents are no more
      applied to elements written in other languages than Korean.  The below
      functions respect elements `lang` attributes:  [[#10]]

       -  `Text.Seonbi.Hanja.phoneticizeHanja`
       -  `Text.Seonbi.Punctuation.normalizeStops`

   -  Removed several functions from `Text.Seonbi.Trie` module:

      anymore:

       -  `Generic a => Generic (Trie a)`
       -  `Binary a => Binary (Trie a)`
       -  `Generic1 Trie`

  Seonbi: SmartyPants for Korean language
  =======================================

  [![][releases-badge]][releases] [![][hackage-badge]][hackage] [![][dockerhub-badge]][dockerhub] [![][ci-status-badge]][ci]

  [![](https://dahlia.github.io/seonbi/showcase.svg)][demo web app]

  (TL;DR: See the [demo web app].)

  Seonbi (선비) is an HTML preprocessor that makes typographic adjustments
  to an HTML so that the result uses accurate punctuations according to
  the modern Korean orthography.
  (It's similar to what [SmartyPants] does for text written in English.)

  It also transforms `ko-Kore` text (國漢文混用; [Korean mixed script]) into
  `ko-Hang` text (한글전용; Hangul-only script).

  Seonbi provides a Haskell library, a CLI, and an HTTP API; any of them can
  perform the following transformations:

   -  All hanja words (e.g., `漢字`) into corresponding hangul-only words
      (e.g., `한자`)
   -  Straight quotes and apostrophes (`"` & `'`) into curly quotes HTML
      entities (`“`, `”`, `‘`, & `’`)
   -  Three consecutive periods (`...` or `。。。`) into an ellipsis entity (`…`)
   -  Classical (Chinese-style) stops (`。` & `、`) into modern (English-style)
      stops (`.` & `,`)
   -  Pairs of less-than and greater-than inequality symbols (`<` & `>`) into
      pairs of proper angle quotes (`〈` & `〉`)
   -  Pairs of two consecutive inequality symbols (`<<` & `>>`) into
      pairs of proper double angle quotes (`《` & `》`)
   -  A hyphen (`-`) or hangul vowel *eu* (`ㅡ`) surrounded by spaces, or
      two/three consecutive hyphens (`--` or `---`) into a proper em dash (`—`)
   -  A less-than inequality symbol followed by a hyphen or an equality
      symbol (`<-`, `<=`) into arrows to the left (`←`, `⇐`)
   -  A hyphen or an equality symbol followed by a greater-than inequality
      symbol (`->`, `=>`) into arrows to the right (`→`, `⇒`)
   -  A hyphen or an equality symbol wrapped by inequality symbols (`<->`, `<=>`)
      into bi-directional arrows (`↔`, `⇔`)

  Each transformations can be partially turned on and off, and some
  transformations have many options.

  All transformations work with both plain texts and rich text tree.
  In a similar way to SmartyPants, it does not modify characters within
  several sensitive HTML elements like `<pre>`/`<code>`/`<script>`/`<kbd>`.
  Chinese/Japanese stops or hanzi/kanji characters inside elements with
  `lang="zh"`/`lang="ja"`[^1] are never transformed.

  [^1]: Technically, only Korean contents and language-unspecified elements
        are transformed.  Elements having `lang` attribute with language tags
        referring to any Korean language are treated as Korean contents,
        e.g., `ko`, `ko-Hang`, `kor-KP`, `kor-Kore`.

  End-user apps
  -------------

  Technically, Seonbi is basically exposed as a software component,
  which is also known as API (application programming interface), to be used
  as a module of other softwares.

  However, as these official interfaces are not for humans but machines, it's
  not easy to use for end-users whom haven't experienced software
  programming.  For such end-users, here's the list of end-user apps:

   -  [Demo web app]: The official web app.  Not that mobile-friendly
      (usable though).
   -  [Seonbi Translator] (선비 번역기): An iOS shortcut made by
      [Heechan Bak] ([@channprj]).
   -  [seonbi-webapp]: Probably aims to replace the official web app.
      Made by Lee Dogeon ([@moreal]).
   -  [seonbi-ext]: A browser extension made by Lee Dogeon ([@moreal]).

  Installation
  ------------

  Seonbi provides official executable binaries for Linux (x86_64), macOS,
  and Windows (64-bit).  You can download them from the [releases] page.

  It is also distributed as a [Docker image][dockerhub]:

      $ echo '訓民正音' | docker run -i dahlia/seonbi:latest seonbi
      훈민정음

  If you want to use it as a Haskell library install the [seonbi][hackage] package
  using Stack or Cabal.


  CLI
  ---

  The `seonbi` command basically takes the input HTML as standard input, and
  then transforms it into the output HTML as standard output:

      seonbi < input.html > output.html

  You could pass a filename as an argument instead (and it is `-` by default):

      seonbi input.html > output.html

  There is `-o`/`--output` option as well:

      seonbi -o output.html input.html

  Although it automatically detects text encoding of the input file,
  you could explicitly specify `-e`/`--encoding`:

      seonbi -e euc-kr -o output.html input.html

  Although there are several style options, e.g., `-q`/`--quote`, `-c`/`--cite`,
  `-r`/`--render-hanja`, in most cases, giving `-p`/`--preset` is enough:

      echo '平壤 冷麵' | seonbi -p ko-kr  # 평양 냉면
      echo '平壤 冷麵' | seonbi -p ko-kp  # 평양 랭면

  Read `-h`/`--help` for details:

      seonbi --help


  HTTP API
  --------

  The `seonbi-api` command starts an HTTP server that takes `POST` requests
  with an HTML source with transformation options, and responds with
  a transformed result HTML.  You can decide a hostname and a port number
  with `-H`/`--host` and `-p`/`--port` options:

      seonbi-api -H 0.0.0.0 -p 3800

  The following is an example request:

      POST / HTTP/1.1
      Content-Type: application/json
      Host: localhost:3800

      {
        "preset": "ko-kr",
        "contentType": "text/html",
        "sourceHtml": "<p>하늘과 바람과 별과 詩</p>"
      }

  The HTTP API server would respond like this:

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Type: application/json
      Server: Seonbi/0.3.0

      {
        "success": true,
        "contentType": "text/html",
        "resultHtml": "<p>하늘과 바람과 별과 시</p>"
      }

  If a web app needs to use the HTTP API server, [CORS] should be configured
  through `--allow-origin`/`-o` option:

      seonbi-api -o https://example.com

  To learn more about parameters interactively, try the [demo web app].

  [CORS]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS


  Haskell API
  -----------

  All functions and types lie inside `Text.Seonbi` module and its submodules.
  The highest-level API is `Text.Seonbi.Facade` module.

  See also the [API docs] or [Hackage].

  [API docs]: https://dahlia.github.io/seonbi/docs/


  Deno API
  --------

  There is a simple client library for Deno as well.  See also
  the [scripts/deno/](scripts/deno/) directory.


  License
  -------

  Distributed under LGPL 2.1 or later.


  Etymology
  ---------

  *[Seonbi]* (선비) means a classical scholar during Joseon periods (14c–19c).
  Today there's a meme that calls a person who feels morally superior or has
  elitism *seonbi* in the Korean internet.  So *seonbi* and *smarty pants* have
  some things in common.
