changelog: |
  0.4.2: [2019.06.06]
  ----------
  * Add `Euclidean` typeclass.
  * Add `Mod2`, the integers modulo 2, along with its Semiring/Ring/Star
    instances.
  0.4.1: [2019.05.04]
  -------------------
  * Remove unlawful and useless `Ring` instance for `GHC.Natural.Natural`.
  * Correct behaviour/docs of Data.Semiring.(^)

  0.4: [2019.05.01]
  -----------------
  * Remove unlawful instances of `Ring` (thanks to @Bodigrim for noticing these)
  * Add `fromNatural` to `Semiring` typeclass (thanks @Bodigrim)
  * Remove Semiring/Ring instances for [] and Vector. (thanks @Bodigrim)
    These instances are better served by a dedicated polynomial package,
    which @Bodigrim has made at http://hackage.haskell.org/package/poly.
  * Add isZero/isOne predicates.

  0.3.1.2: [2019.04.02]

    to POSIX types. Thanks to @Bodigrim and @CarlEdman for
    reporting this.

  0.2.0.1: [2018.07.28]
  ---------------------
  * Add instances for `Op`, `Equivalence`, `Comparison`, and `Predicate` from Data.Functor.Contravariant (upcoming base 4.12.0.0)
  * docfix for (prod -> product, prod' -> product') change that occured in version 0.2.0.0.

  0.2.0.0: [2018.07.23]
  ---------------------
  * Fixed the `Semiring` instances of `Set`, `HashSet`, `Vector`, `Storable Vector`, `Unboxed Vector`.
  * Removed the `Semiring` instances of `Seq`, `Alt`, `Endo`.
  * Added comprehensive test suite that tests all `Semiring` instances defined in Data.Semiring
  * Added Free semiring (Data.Semiring.Free)
  * Added newtypes: `Add`, `Mul`
  * Bounds for containers: [0.3,0.6] -> [0.5.4,0.6.0.9]
  * Add semiring instance for `Proxy`
  * names changed: (prod -> product, prod' -> product')
  * sum' and product' now use foldl' instead of foldr'

  0.1.2: [2018.05.04]
  -------------------
  * `semirings` now builds back to
    GHC-7.4.1.
  * many doc fixes.

  0.1.1: [2018.04.20]
  -------------------
  * Remove unused `coerce-util` dependency.

  semirings
  ==========
  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/semirings.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/semirings) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chessai/semirings.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chessai/semirings)

  Haskellers are usually familiar with monoids and semigroups. A monoid has an appending operation `<>` or `mappend` and an identity element `mempty`. A semigroup has an append `<>`, but does not require an `mempty` element.

  A Semiring has two appending operations, 'plus' and 'times', and two respective identity elements, 'zero' and 'one'.

  More formally, A semiring R is a set equipped with two binary relations + and *, such that:

  - (R, +) is a commutative monoid with identity element 0:
    - (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
    - 0 + a = a + 0 = a
    - a + b = b + a
  - (R, *) is a monoid with identity element 1:
    - (a * b) * c = a * (b * c)
    - 1 * a = a * 1 = a
  - Multiplication left and right distributes over addition
    - a * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c)
    - (a + b) * c = (a * c) + (b * c)
  - Multiplication by '0' annihilates R:
    - 0 * a = a * 0 = 0

  *-semirings
  ===========

  A *-semiring (pron. "star-semiring") is any semiring with an additional operation 'star' (read as "asteration"), such that:

  - star a = 1 + a * star a = 1 + star a * a

  A derived operation called "aplus" can be defined in terms of star by:

  - star :: a -> a
  - star a = 1 + aplus a
  - aplus :: a -> a
  - aplus a = a * star a

  As such, a minimal instance of the typeclass 'Star' requires only 'star' or 'aplus' to be defined.

  use cases
  =========

  semirings themselves are useful as a way to express that a type that supports a commutative and associative operation.
  Some examples:

  - Numbers {Int, Integer, Word, Double, etc.}:
    - 'plus' is 'Prelude.+'
    - 'times' is 'Prelude.*'
    - 'zero' is 0.
    - 'one' is 1.
  - Booleans:
    - 'plus' is '||'
    - 'times' is '&&'
    - 'zero' is 'False'
    - 'one' is 'True'
  - Set:
    - 'plus' is 'union'
    - 'times' is 'intersection'
    - 'zero' is the empty Set.
    - 'one' is the singleton Set containing the 'one' element of the underlying type.
  - NFA:
    - 'plus' unions two NFAs.
    - 'times' appends two NFAs.
    - 'zero' is the NFA that acceptings nothing.
    - 'one' is the empty NFA.
  - DFA:
    - 'plus' unions two DFAs.
    - 'times' intersects two DFAs.
    - 'zero' is the DFA that accepts nothing.
    - 'one' is the DFA that accepts everything.

  *-semirings are useful in a number of applications; such as matrix algebra, regular expressions, kleene algebras, graph theory, tropical algebra, dataflow analysis, power series, and linear recurrence relations.
