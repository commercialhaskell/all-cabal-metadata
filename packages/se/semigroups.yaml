changelog: ! "0.18.5 [2018.07.02]\n-------------------\n* Use a more efficient `sconcat`
  for the `Semigroup` instances for strict and\n  lazy `ByteString`.\n\n0.18.4 [2018.01.29]\n-------------------\n*
  Backport `Semigroup` instances for `Data.Ord.Down` and strict `ST`, which were\n
  \ added in `base-4.11`.\n\n0.18.3\n------\n* Add `Semigroup` instance for `IO`,
  as well as for `Event` and `Lifetime` from\n  `GHC.Event`\n* Add `Eq1`, `Ord1`,
  `Read1`, and `Show1` instances for `NonEmpty`\n* Define `Generic` and `Generic1`
  instances back to GHC 7.2, and expose the\n  `Data.Semigroup.Generic` module on
  GHC 7.2\n\n0.18.2\n------\n* Depend on the `bytestring-builder` package to ensure
  `Semigroup` instances for bytestring `Builder` and `ShortByteString` are always
  defined\n* Allow building with `binary-0.8.3` and later\n\n0.18.1\n------\n* Add
  the missing instance for `Data.Binary.Builder.Builder`.\n\n0.18.0.1\n--------\n*
  Added support for `base-4.9`\n\n0.18\n--------\n* Removed the partial functions
  `words`, `unwords`, `lines`, `unlines`\n\n0.17.0.1\n--------\n* Fixed the `@since`
  annotations\n\n0.17\n----\n* Added `groupWith`, `groupAllWith`, `groupWith1`, `groupAllWith1`\n*
  Renamed `sortOn` to `sortWith` to match the \"Comprehensive comprehensions\" paper
  and `TransformListComp` extension.\n* Add `Semigroup` instances for `Alt`, `Void`,
  `Proxy` and `Tagged`\n* Add `Num` instances for `Min` and `Max`\n* Removed `times1p`
  in favor of `stimes`.\n\n0.16.2.2\n--------\n* Cleaned up imports to remove warnings
  on GHC 7.10.\n\n0.16.2.1\n--------\n* Restored the ability to build on GHC < 7.6.
  (`Generic1` deriving was only added in GHC 7.6)\n\n0.16.2\n------\n* Added `genericMappend`
  and supporting `GSemigroup` class for generically deriving Semigroup instances.\n*
  Added `Arg a b` which only compares for equality/order on its first argument, which
  can be used to compute `argmin` and `argmax`.\n* Add `Bifunctor` `Arg` instance
  to avoid orphans for GHC 7.10+.\n* Added missing `Data.Monoid.Generic` module to
  source control.\n\n0.16.1\n------\n* Added `Semigroup` instances for various Builder
  constructions in `text` and `bytestring` where available.\n* Added `MonadFix` and
  `MonadPlus` instances for `NonEmpty`.\n\n0.16.0.1\n--------\n* Bumped `deepseq`
  version bound for GHC 7.10 compatibility.\n\n0.16\n----\n* `times1p` and `timesN`
  are now reduced to accepting only a `Natural` argument. `Whole` doesn't exist in
  GHC 7.10's Numeric.Natural, and `nats` version 1 has removed support for the class.\n\n0.15.4\n------\n*
  Use `Data.Coerce.coerce` on GHC 7.8+ to reduce the number of eta-expansions in the
  resulting core.\n* Avoid conflict with pending `Foldable.length` in base.\n\n0.15.3\n------\n*
  `instance NFData a => NFData (NonEmpty a)`\n* Added `NFData` instances for the types
  in Data.Semigroup\n\n0.15.2\n------\n* Fixed a Trustworthiness problem for GHC 7.8+\n\n0.15.1\n------\n*
  Nathan van Doorn fixed a number of embarrassing bugs in the `Enum` instances.\n\n0.15\n----\n*
  `instance IsList NonEmpty`\n\n0.14\n----\n* Allow for manual removal of dependencies
  to support advanced sandbox users who explicitly want to avoid compiling certain
  dependencies\n  they know they aren't using.\n\n  We will fix bugs caused by any
  combination of these package flags, but the API of the package should be considered
  the default build\n  configuration with all of the package dependency flags enabled.\n\n*
  Will now build as full-fledged `Safe` Haskell if you configure with -f-hashable.\n\n*
  Added some missing `Generic`/`Generic`/`Hashable` instances\n\n0.13.0.1\n--------\n*
  `Generic` support requires `ghc-prim` on GHC 7.4.\n\n0.13\n----\n* Added instances
  for 'Generic', 'Foldable', 'Traversable', 'Enum', 'Functor', 'Hashable', 'Applicative',
  'Monad' and 'MonadFix'\n\n0.12.2\n------\n* Vastly widened the dependency bound
  on `text` and `bytestring`.\n\n0.12.1\n-------\n* Updated to support the new version
  of `text`.\n* Added `transpose`, `sortBy` and `sortWith`.\n\n0.12\n----\n* Added
  an instance for `Const r`.\n* Added `some1`\n\n0.11\n----\n* Added the missing instance
  for `HashSet`.\n\n0.10\n----\n* Added support for `unordered-containers`, `bytestring`
  and `text`.\n\n0.9.2\n-----\n* Added a `DefaultSignature` for `(<>)` in terms of
  `mappend`.\n\n\n0.9.1\n-----\n* Added `timesN`.\n\n0.9\n---\n* Moved `Numeric.Natural`
  to a separate `nats` package.\n"

  ==========


  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/semigroups.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/semigroups)
  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ekmett/semigroups.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ekmett/semigroups)


  Haskellers are usually familiar with monoids. A monoid has an appending operation
  `<>` or `mappend` and an identity element `mempty`. A Semigroup has an append `<>`,
  but does not require an `mempty` element. A Monoid can be made a Semigroup with
  just `instance Semigroup MyMonoid`


  More formally, a semigroup is an algebraic structure consisting of a set together
  with an associative binary operation. A semigroup generalizes a monoid in that there
  might not exist an identity element. It also (originally) generalized a group (a
  monoid with all inverses) to a type where every element did not have to have an
  inverse, thus the name semigroup.


  `Data.Semigroup` and `Data.List.NonEmpty` were added to `base` as of 4.9.0.0. This
  package now offers a backwards-compatible API and some tools for deriving semigroups
  with generics.
