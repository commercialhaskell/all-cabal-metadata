changelog: |
  0.19 [2019.05.10]
  -----------------
  * The `(<>)` method of the backported `Semigroup` class no longer has a default
    implementation in terms of `mappend`. This mirrors the `Data.Semigroup` API
    that was introduced in `base-4.9`. This is a breaking change for any
    `Semigroup` instances that are defined in tandem with versions of `base`
    older than 4.9.
  * Make the backported `Hashable Arg` instance reflect its respective variants
    in the `hashable` package. In `hashable-1.3`, the `Hashable Arg` instance
    only hashes the first argument, lest equal values have different hashes.
  * Backport the `Lift (NonEmpty a)` instance introduced in
    `template-haskell-2.15.0.0`.
  * `Data.List.NonEmpty` is now unconditionally `Trustworthy`.

  0.18.5 [2018.07.02]
  -------------------
  * Use a more efficient `sconcat` for the `Semigroup` instances for strict and
    lazy `ByteString`.

  0.18.4 [2018.01.29]
  -------------------
  * Backport `Semigroup` instances for `Data.Ord.Down` and strict `ST`, which were
    added in `base-4.11`.

  0.18.3
  ------
  * Add `Semigroup` instance for `IO`, as well as for `Event` and `Lifetime` from
    `GHC.Event`
  * Add `Eq1`, `Ord1`, `Read1`, and `Show1` instances for `NonEmpty`
  * Define `Generic` and `Generic1` instances back to GHC 7.2, and expose the
    `Data.Semigroup.Generic` module on GHC 7.2

  0.18.2
  ------
  * Depend on the `bytestring-builder` package to ensure `Semigroup` instances for bytestring `Builder` and `ShortByteString` are always defined
  * Allow building with `binary-0.8.3` and later

  0.18.1
  ------
  * Add the missing instance for `Data.Binary.Builder.Builder`.

  0.18.0.1
  --------
  * Added support for `base-4.9`

  0.18
  --------
  * Removed the partial functions `words`, `unwords`, `lines`, `unlines`

  0.17.0.1
  --------
  * Fixed the `@since` annotations

  0.17
  ----
  * Added `groupWith`, `groupAllWith`, `groupWith1`, `groupAllWith1`
  * Renamed `sortOn` to `sortWith` to match the "Comprehensive comprehensions" paper and `TransformListComp` extension.
  * Add `Semigroup` instances for `Alt`, `Void`, `Proxy` and `Tagged`
  * Add `Num` instances for `Min` and `Max`
  * Removed `times1p` in favor of `stimes`.

  0.16.2.2
  --------
  * Cleaned up imports to remove warnings on GHC 7.10.

  0.16.2.1
  --------
  * Restored the ability to build on GHC < 7.6. (`Generic1` deriving was only added in GHC 7.6)

  0.16.2
  ------
  * Added `genericMappend` and supporting `GSemigroup` class for generically deriving Semigroup instances.
  * Added `Arg a b` which only compares for equality/order on its first argument, which can be used to compute `argmin` and `argmax`.
  * Add `Bifunctor` `Arg` instance to avoid orphans for GHC 7.10+.
  * Added missing `Data.Monoid.Generic` module to source control.

  0.16.1
  ------
  * Added `Semigroup` instances for various Builder constructions in `text` and `bytestring` where available.
  * Added `MonadFix` and `MonadPlus` instances for `NonEmpty`.

  0.16.0.1
  --------
  * Bumped `deepseq` version bound for GHC 7.10 compatibility.

  0.16
  ----
  * `times1p` and `timesN` are now reduced to accepting only a `Natural` argument. `Whole` doesn't exist in GHC 7.10's Numeric.Natural, and `nats` version 1 has removed support for the class.

  0.15.4
  ------
  * Use `Data.Coerce.coerce` on GHC 7.8+ to reduce the number of eta-expansions in the resulting core.
  * Avoid conflict with pending `Foldable.length` in base.

  0.15.3
  ------
  * `instance NFData a => NFData (NonEmpty a)`
  * Added `NFData` instances for the types in Data.Semigroup

  0.15.2
  ------
  * Fixed a Trustworthiness problem for GHC 7.8+

  0.15.1
  ------
  * Nathan van Doorn fixed a number of embarrassing bugs in the `Enum` instances.

  0.15
  ----
  * `instance IsList NonEmpty`

  0.14
  ----
  * Allow for manual removal of dependencies to support advanced sandbox users who explicitly want to avoid compiling certain dependencies
    they know they aren't using.

    We will fix bugs caused by any combination of these package flags, but the API of the package should be considered the default build
    configuration with all of the package dependency flags enabled.

  * Will now build as full-fledged `Safe` Haskell if you configure with -f-hashable.

  * Added some missing `Generic`/`Generic`/`Hashable` instances

  0.13.0.1
  --------
  * `Generic` support requires `ghc-prim` on GHC 7.4.

  0.13
  ----
  * Added instances for 'Generic', 'Foldable', 'Traversable', 'Enum', 'Functor', 'Hashable', 'Applicative', 'Monad' and 'MonadFix'

  0.12.2
  ------
  * Vastly widened the dependency bound on `text` and `bytestring`.

  0.12.1
  -------
  * Updated to support the new version of `text`.
  * Added `transpose`, `sortBy` and `sortWith`.

  0.12
  ----
  * Added an instance for `Const r`.
  * Added `some1`

  0.11
  ----
  * Added the missing instance for `HashSet`.

  0.10
  ----
  * Added support for `unordered-containers`, `bytestring` and `text`.

  0.9.2
  -----
  * Added a `DefaultSignature` for `(<>)` in terms of `mappend`.


  0.9.1
  -----
  * Added `timesN`.

  0.9
  ---
  * Moved `Numeric.Natural` to a separate `nats` package.

  ==========

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/semigroups.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/semigroups) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ekmett/semigroups.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ekmett/semigroups)

  Haskellers are usually familiar with monoids. A monoid has an appending operation `<>` or `mappend` and an identity element `mempty`. A Semigroup has an append `<>`, but does not require an `mempty` element. A Monoid can be made a Semigroup with just `instance Semigroup MyMonoid`

  More formally, a semigroup is an algebraic structure consisting of a set together with an associative binary operation. A semigroup generalizes a monoid in that there might not exist an identity element. It also (originally) generalized a group (a monoid with all inverses) to a type where every element did not have to have an inverse, thus the name semigroup.

  `Data.Semigroup` and `Data.List.NonEmpty` were added to `base` as of 4.9.0.0. This package now offers a backwards-compatible API and some tools for deriving semigroups with generics.
