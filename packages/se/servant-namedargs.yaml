description: |
  This library provides combinators to add named arguments to servant endpoints. These combinators are all isomorphic to existing servant combinators\*, and so a type family `Transform` is also provided for converting namedargs combinators to and from default servant combinators. Following the pattern of servant itself, this library *only* adds the combinators and instances for link generation: for the instances to actually use them with servant-client and servant-server, look at servant-client-namedargs and servant-server-namedargs.

  \* NamedBody' is NOT isomorphic to ReqBody', because ReqBody' doesn't have a name. Conversions are still provided, but going from a NamedBody' to a ReqBody' will lose the associated name of the NamedBody', and going from a ReqBody' to a NamedBody' requires a default name which will be applied.
