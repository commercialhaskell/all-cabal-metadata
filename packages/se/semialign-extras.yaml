  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/qfpl/semialign-extras.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/qfpl/semialign-extras)

  The `Semialign` typeclass (from
  [`semialign`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/semialign)) lets us
  line up two structures of the same type. By combining this with the
  `Filterable` and `Witherable` typeclasses from the
  [`witherable`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/witherable)
  package, we can derive a number of useful diff/patch/merge-style
  operations.

  ## Scope of the Library

  `semialign-extras` aims to be a collection of interesting
  abstractions/operations that:

  1. Build on top of (at least) the `Semialign` typeclass, or related
     classes from the `semialign` universe; and

  2. Do not belong inside other packages in the `semialign` universe.

  PRs that serve these goals are most welcome.

  ### Rationale

  `semialign` has a very lean dependency footprint, and its authors
  intend to keep it that way. If your PR can work within the small
  dependency footprint of `semialign`, it probably should be offered up
  there first.

  `semialign-extras` already depends on `lens`, so the marginal cost of
  additional dependencies is likely to be small.
