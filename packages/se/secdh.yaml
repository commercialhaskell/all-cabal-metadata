description: |-
  SECDH stands for "Stack-Environment-Code-Dump-Heap", and is an
  abstract machine based on Landin's classic SECD machine for evaluation
  of lambda-calculus expressions. This machine adds a heap of suspension
  cells to the structure managed by the machine, allowing fully-lazy
  evaluation, similar to Haskell. The machine operates directly on the
  syntax tree, as Landin's machine does. The entire implementation,
  including parser, evaluator, and garbage collector, occupies just over
  1100 lines of code.
