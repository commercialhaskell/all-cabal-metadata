synopsis: A package with basic parsing utilities for several Bioinformatic data formats.
changelog: "V 1.1.4.1: First entry in the Changelog. Added Haddock documentation to
  all modules and prepare for releasing on Hackage.\n\nV 1.1.4.2: Exporting readVCFfromProd\n\nV
  1.1.5: Fixed VCF parser: Now breaks if lines end prematurely\n\nV 1.1.6: VCF parser
  now allows for truncated VCF files with no Format and Genotypes (sites-only VCF
  files)\n\nV 1.1.7: Added option to parse Bim file (slightly different layout to
  Eigenstrat Snp Format), and added genetic position and snpId to the EigenstratSnpEntry
  datastructure. This will cause breaking changes in code linking against this library.\n\nV
  1.1.8: Added more consumers for Bim and Eigenstrat Snp files\n\nV 1.1.8.1: Added
  Eq class to EigenstratInd and Sex\n\nV 1.1.8.2: Added Eq and Show classes to various
  FreqSum entities. Fixed writing function, added tests.\n\nV 1.1.8.3: Added tests
  for Fasta import. Succeed.\n\nV 1.2.0: Added tests for VCF, and several bugfixes.
  Now runs on LTS-14.1 with pipes-text as legacy dependency.\n\nV 1.3.0: Removed pipes-text,
  text and turtle dependencies and some more. Restructured all datatypes to use Bytestring
  instead of text. \n\nV 1.3.1: Moved test suite outside of the main library into
  the test source directory. Cleaner setup.\n\nV 1.3.2: Added testDat to Cabal file
  to make tests work off the tarball.\n\nV 1.3.2.1: Fixed a hard-coded absolute path
  in the test-suite.\n\nV 1.3.3: Added Pileup as new format. Changed all tests to
  Hspec.\n\nV 1.4.0: Added three features:\n* Chromosomes now include `X`, `Y` and
  `MT` (or `chrX`, `chrY`, `chrMT`), in that order after `chr22`. \n* SNP rsId information
  is now internallyincluded as an option in the FreqSum data format.\n* Pileup Format
  now also records strandorientation\n\nV 1.4.0.1: Added test file example.pileup
  to cabal extra-source-files to make tests work.\n\nV 1.4.1:\n* Added optional genetic
  position to FreqSumformat,\n* changed various internal strings toByteStrings and
  vice versa."

  Sequence-Formats is a Haskell package to provide file parsers and writers for some commonly, and less commonly used file formats in Bioinformatics, speficially population genetics.

  The library makes heavy use of the [pipes library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes) to provide Producers and Consumers for reading and writing files.
