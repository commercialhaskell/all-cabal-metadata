synopsis: A package with basic parsing utilities for several Bioinformatic data formats.
changelog: "V 1.5.1.2: added readPlink to export list of Plink module.\n\nV 1.5.1:
  minor updates for hackage\n\nV 1.5.0: Added Plink support.\n\nV 1.4.1:\n* Added
  optional genetic position to FreqSumformat,\n* changed various internal strings
  toByteStrings and vice versa.\n\nV 1.4.0.1: Added test file example.pileup to cabal
  extra-source-files to make tests work.\n\nV 1.4.0: Added three features:\n* Chromosomes
  now include `X`, `Y` and `MT` (or `chrX`, `chrY`, `chrMT`), in that order after
  `chr22`. \n* SNP rsId information is now internallyincluded as an option in the
  FreqSum data format.\n* Pileup Format now also records strandorientation\n\nV 1.3.3:
  Added Pileup as new format. Changed all tests to Hspec.\n\nV 1.3.2.1: Fixed a hard-coded
  absolute path in the test-suite.\n\nV 1.3.2: Added testDat to Cabal file to make
  tests work off the tarball.\n\nV 1.3.1: Moved test suite outside of the main library
  into the test source directory. Cleaner setup.\n\nV 1.3.0: Removed pipes-text, text
  and turtle dependencies and some more. Restructured all datatypes to use Bytestring
  instead of text. \n\nV 1.2.0: Added tests for VCF, and several bugfixes. Now runs
  on LTS-14.1 with pipes-text as legacy dependency.\n\nV 1.1.8.3: Added tests for
  Fasta import. Succeed.\n\nV 1.1.8.2: Added Eq and Show classes to various FreqSum
  entities. Fixed writing function, added tests.\nV 1.1.8.1: Added Eq class to EigenstratInd
  and Sex\nV 1.1.8: Added more consumers for Bim and Eigenstrat Snp files\nV 1.1.7:
  Added option to parse Bim file (slightly different layout to Eigenstrat Snp Format),
  and added genetic position and snpId to the EigenstratSnpEntry datastructure. This
  will cause breaking changes in code linking against this library.\nV 1.1.6: VCF
  parser now allows for truncated VCF files with no Format and Genotypes (sites-only
  VCF files)\nV 1.1.5: Fixed VCF parser: Now breaks if lines end prematurely\nV 1.1.4.2:
  Exporting readVCFfromProd\nV 1.1.4.1: First entry in the Changelog. Added Haddock
  documentation to all modules and prepare for releasing on Hackage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

  Sequence-Formats is a Haskell package to provide file parsers and writers for some commonly, and less commonly used file formats in Bioinformatics, speficially population genetics.

  The library makes heavy use of the [pipes library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes) to provide Producers and Consumers for reading and writing files.
