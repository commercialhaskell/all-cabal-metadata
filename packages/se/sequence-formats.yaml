synopsis: A package with basic parsing utilities for several Bioinformatic data formats.
changelog: "# Changelog\n\n- V 1.7.1: Made compatible with latest GHC\n- V 1.7.0:
  Bumped major version for breaking change (correct mistake from 1.6.7.0). Also correct
  lower pvp-bounds on hackage to be compatible with LTS-18.28.\n- V 1.6.7.0:\n    *
  Added an option to Plink output, which allows users to store the population mame
  in either the first or last column, or both\n    * Fixed a bug in the pileup-parser
  which failed at reference-skip symbols (\">\" and \"<\").\n- V 1.6.6.0: Added a
  minimal Bed parser and a bed-filter\n- V 1.6.5.0: Long chromosome names are now
  parsed correctly\n- V 1.6.4: Fixed a bug in Fasta parsing which would skip the first
  line if the header was minimal.\n- V 1.6.3: Pileup reference-base is read as upper
  case, even if it's not in the file.\n- V 1.6.2: Made compatible with GHC 9 (thanks
  to github user sjakobi)\n- V 1.6.0: Plink Output now supported.\n- V 1.5.1.4: Plink
  BIM parsing now automatically converts from Numbers (0,1,2,3,4) to Letters (N,A,C,T,G).\n-
  V 1.5.1.3: added possibility to parse allele names 01234 in bim files.\n- V 1.5.1.2:
  added readPlink to export list of Plink module.\n- V 1.5.1: minor updates for hackage\n-
  V 1.5.0: Added Plink support.\n- V 1.4.1:\n    * Added optional genetic position
  to FreqSumformat,\n    * changed various internal strings toByteStrings and vice
  versa.\n- V 1.4.0.1: Added test file example.pileup to cabal extra-source-files
  to make tests work.\n- V 1.4.0: Added three features:\n    * Chromosomes now include
  `X`, `Y` and `MT` (or `chrX`, `chrY`, `chrMT`), in that order after `chr22`. \n
  \   * SNP rsId information is now internallyincluded as an option in the FreqSum
  data format.\n    * Pileup Format now also records strandorientation\n- V 1.3.3:
  Added Pileup as new format. Changed all tests to Hspec.\n- V 1.3.2.1: Fixed a hard-coded
  absolute path in the test-suite.\n- V 1.3.2: Added testDat to Cabal file to make
  tests work off the tarball.\n- V 1.3.1: Moved test suite outside of the main library
  into the test source directory. Cleaner setup.\n- V 1.3.0: Removed pipes-text, text
  and turtle dependencies and some more. Restructured all datatypes to use Bytestring
  instead of text. \n- V 1.2.0: Added tests for VCF, and several bugfixes. Now runs
  on LTS-14.1 with pipes-text as legacy dependency.\n- V 1.1.8.3: Added tests for
  Fasta import. Succeed.\n- V 1.1.8.2: Added Eq and Show classes to various FreqSum
  entities. Fixed writing function, added tests.\n- V 1.1.8.1: Added Eq class to EigenstratInd
  and Sex\n- V 1.1.8: Added more consumers for Bim and Eigenstrat Snp files\n- V 1.1.7:
  Added option to parse Bim file (slightly different layout to Eigenstrat Snp Format),
  and added genetic position and snpId to the EigenstratSnpEntry datastructure. This
  will cause breaking changes in code linking against this library.\n- V 1.1.6: VCF
  parser now allows for truncated VCF files with no Format and Genotypes (sites-only
  VCF files)\n- V 1.1.5: Fixed VCF parser: Now breaks if lines end prematurely\n-
  V 1.1.4.2: Exporting readVCFfromProd\n- V 1.1.4.1: First entry in the Changelog.
  Added Haddock documentation to all modules and prepare for releasing on Hackage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

  Sequence-Formats is a Haskell package to provide file parsers and writers for some commonly, and less commonly used file formats in Bioinformatics, speficially population genetics.

  The library makes heavy use of the [pipes library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes) to provide Producers and Consumers for reading and writing files.
