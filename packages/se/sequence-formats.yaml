changelog: "# Changelog\n\n- V 1.11.0.2: exposed parseSex from Eigenstrat\n- V 1.11.0.1:
  Allowing missing alternative alleles when converting VCF to FreqSum, and improved
  error messaging.\n- V 1.11.0.0: Added support for writing of VCF files, including
  gzipping. Made some breaking API changes on top, for example\n  to make the FreqSum
  data representation safer with respect to Ploidy. Also replaced String types in
  Eigenstrat and Plink formats to ByteStrings for efficiency. We anyway don't support
  Unicode with the AttoParsec library.\n- V 1.10.0.0: Brought gzip-writing support
  for Eigenstrat and Plink files back to non-breaking API in `writeEigenstrat` and
  `writePlink`. Client code can safely update from 1.8.X to 1.10.0.0.\n- V 1.9.0.0:
  Added gzip-writing support for Eigenstrat and Plink files. This required a breaking
  change in `writeEigenstrat` and `writePlink`.\n- V 1.8.1.0: Added gzip-support (read-only
  for now) for Plink (bed and bim files) and VCF.\n- V 1.8.0.1: Allow reading arbitrary
  letters as reference base in Pileup format. Before only ACTG, N and M were allowed.\n
  \   Now all letters are allowed, as we found out that reference fasta files can
  contain more letters than just those and we\n    don't want to immediately stop
  parsing in that case.\n- V 1.8.0.0: Fixed a bug in the VCF parser that would not
  accept missing values in QUAL fields (even though the spec explicitly allows for
  it). This also changed the VCF row structure data type\n- V 1.7.1: Made compatible
  with latest GHC\n- V 1.7.0: Bumped major version for breaking change (correct mistake
  from 1.6.7.0). Also correct lower pvp-bounds on hackage to be compatible with LTS-18.28.\n-
  V 1.6.7.0:\n    * Added an option to Plink output, which allows users to store the
  population mame in either the first or last column, or both\n    * Fixed a bug in
  the pileup-parser which failed at reference-skip symbols (\">\" and \"<\").\n- V
  1.6.6.0: Added a minimal Bed parser and a bed-filter\n- V 1.6.5.0: Long chromosome
  names are now parsed correctly\n- V 1.6.4: Fixed a bug in Fasta parsing which would
  skip the first line if the header was minimal.\n- V 1.6.3: Pileup reference-base
  is read as upper case, even if it's not in the file.\n- V 1.6.2: Made compatible
  with GHC 9 (thanks to github user sjakobi)\n- V 1.6.0: Plink Output now supported.\n-
  V 1.5.1.4: Plink BIM parsing now automatically converts from Numbers (0,1,2,3,4)
  to Letters (N,A,C,T,G).\n- V 1.5.1.3: added possibility to parse allele names 01234
  in bim files.\n- V 1.5.1.2: added readPlink to export list of Plink module.\n- V
  1.5.1: minor updates for hackage\n- V 1.5.0: Added Plink support.\n- V 1.4.1:\n
  \   * Added optional genetic position to FreqSumformat,\n    * changed various internal
  strings toByteStrings and vice versa.\n- V 1.4.0.1: Added test file example.pileup
  to cabal extra-source-files to make tests work.\n- V 1.4.0: Added three features:\n
  \   * Chromosomes now include `X`, `Y` and `MT` (or `chrX`, `chrY`, `chrMT`), in
  that order after `chr22`. \n    * SNP rsId information is now internallyincluded
  as an option in the FreqSum data format.\n    * Pileup Format now also records strandorientation\n-
  V 1.3.3: Added Pileup as new format. Changed all tests to Hspec.\n- V 1.3.2.1: Fixed
  a hard-coded absolute path in the test-suite.\n- V 1.3.2: Added testDat to Cabal
  file to make tests work off the tarball.\n- V 1.3.1: Moved test suite outside of
  the main library into the test source directory. Cleaner setup.\n- V 1.3.0: Removed
  pipes-text, text and turtle dependencies and some more. Restructured all datatypes
  to use Bytestring instead of text. \n- V 1.2.0: Added tests for VCF, and several
  bugfixes. Now runs on LTS-14.1 with pipes-text as legacy dependency.\n- V 1.1.8.3:
  Added tests for Fasta import. Succeed.\n- V 1.1.8.2: Added Eq and Show classes to
  various FreqSum entities. Fixed writing function, added tests.\n- V 1.1.8.1: Added
  Eq class to EigenstratInd and Sex\n- V 1.1.8: Added more consumers for Bim and Eigenstrat
  Snp files\n- V 1.1.7: Added option to parse Bim file (slightly different layout
  to Eigenstrat Snp Format), and added genetic position and snpId to the EigenstratSnpEntry
  datastructure. This will cause breaking changes in code linking against this library.\n-
  V 1.1.6: VCF parser now allows for truncated VCF files with no Format and Genotypes
  (sites-only VCF files)\n- V 1.1.5: Fixed VCF parser: Now breaks if lines end prematurely\n-
  V 1.1.4.2: Exporting readVCFfromProd\n- V 1.1.4.1: First entry in the Changelog.
  Added Haddock documentation to all modules and prepare for releasing on Hackage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

description: |
  Sequence-Formats is a Haskell package to provide file parsers and writers for some commonly, and less commonly used file formats in Bioinformatics, speficially population genetics.

  The library makes heavy use of the [pipes library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes) to provide Producers and Consumers for reading and writing files.
