  # servant-hateoas
  HATEOAS support for [servant](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant).

  ## State
  This is not affiliated with the official `servant` maintainers.

  Currently in infant state.
  Final goal is something similar to what has been proposed [here](https://www.servant.dev/extending.html#other-directions).

  ## What can we do already?
  Define an instance for class `ToResource ct api a` where `ct` is the Content-Type, `a` is the datatype you want to have a resty Api for and
  `api` is the type of your Servant-Api within which the resty representation of your datatype `a` lives.

  When providing some extra information with an instance for `Related a` we can derive related links.
  ## Example
  ```haskell
  data User = User { usrId :: Int, addressId :: Int, income :: Double }
    deriving stock (Generic, Show, Eq, Ord)
    deriving anyclass ToJSON

  data Address = Address { addrId :: Int, street :: String, number :: Int}
    deriving stock (Generic, Show, Eq, Ord)
    deriving anyclass ToJSON

  type CompleteApi = AddressApi :<|> UserApi

  type AddressApi = AddressGetOne
  type AddressGetOne = "address" :> Capture "id" Int :> Get '[HAL JSON] (HALResource Address)

  type UserApi = UserGetOne :<|> UserGetAll
  type UserGetOne = "user" :> Capture "id" Int :> Get '[HAL JSON] (HALResource User)
  type UserGetAll = "user" :> Get '[HAL JSON] (HALResource [User])

  instance Related User where
    type IdSelName User      = "usrId"              -- This is type-safe because of using class HasField
    type GetOneApi User      = UserGetOne
    type CollectionName User = "users"
    type Relations User      =
      '[ 'HRel "address" "addressId" AddressGetOne  -- Also type-safe
       ]
  ```
  ```haskell
  >>> mimeRender (Proxy @JSON) $ toResource (Proxy @(HAL JSON)) (Proxy @CompleteApi) $ User 1 100 100000
  ```
  ```json
  {
    "_links": {
      "address": {
        "href": "address/100"
      },
      "self": {
        "href": "user/1"
      }
    },
    "addressId": 100,
    "income": 100000,
    "usrId": 1
  }
  ```

  ## Goals
  - [x] Deriving links where possible
  - [ ] Deriving links for paging, ...
  - [ ] Type-level rewriting of APIs like `CompleteAPI` to make API HATEOAS-compliant

  ## Media-Types
  Currently we only serve Content-Type `application/hal+json`.
  Support for others such as `application/vnd.collection+json` or `application/vnd.amundsen-uber+json` can easily be added
  with instances for `Accept` and `MimeRender`.

  Client usage with `MimeUnrender` is not yet supported but easily extensible.
