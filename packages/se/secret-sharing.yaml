description: ! 'Implementation of an (@m@,@n@)-threshold secret sharing scheme.

  A given ByteString @b@ (the secret) is split into @n@ shares,

  and any @m@ shares are sufficient to reconstruct @b@.

  The scheme preserves information-theoretic perfect secrecy in the sense that the
  knowledge of up

  to @m-1@ shares does not reveal any information about the secret @b@.


  /Example in GHCi:/

  Suppose that you want to split the string \"my secret data\" into n=5 shares such
  that

  at least m=3 shares are necessary to reconstruct the secret.


  >> :m + Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 Crypto.SecretSharing

  >> let secret = pack "my secret message!"

  >> shares <- encode 3 5 secret

  >> mapM_ (Prelude.putStrLn . show) shares -- each share should be deposited at a
  different site.
