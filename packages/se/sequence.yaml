  0.9.8.0:
  * Fixed incomplete pattern errors for `FastQueue` and `BSeq`.
  * Fixed fold order for `BSeq`.
  * Added a small test suite.
  * Added `Semigroup`, `Monoid`, `Eq`, `Ord`, `Show`, `Show1`,
  and `Read` instances for all the sequences.
  * Added a `fromList` method.
  * Made all method implementations reasonably efficient (to the
  extent possible for each structure). The defaults led to some
  operations being too slow to allow the test suite to complete.
  * Fixed a strictness bug in `viewl` for `FastQueue` that caused its
  amortized bounds to degrade under persistence.
  * Made folds and traversals for `FastQueue` respect the worst-case
  bounds for each element pulled.
  * Made `fmap` for `FastQueue` stop mapping over the schedule.
  * Arranged for GHC to be able to unpack `FastQueue`, though that
  will not immediately improve `FastCatQueue`.
  0.9.7: Added binary tree sequence datastructure
  0.9.6: Fixed bug in Functor for FastQueue which causes it be not O(1)
  0.9.5: Added traversable instances (thanks dolio!)
  0.9.4: More fixing docs
  0.9.3: Fix docs
  0.9.2: Fix error in cabal file
  0.9.1: Error in git repo
  0.9.0: Initial version
