  # Changelog

  ## v1.0.0.1

  -   Few small fixes to make sure tests build with recent versions of GHC.
      [#22](https://github.com/cdepillabout/servant-static-th/pull/22).
      Thanks [@blackheaven](https://github.com/blackheaven)!

  ## v1.0.0.0

  -   Serve any files called `index.html` on the root `/` as well as the path
      `/index.html`. This makes servant-static-th operate similar to how web
      servers like Apache or nginx work.
      [#19](https://github.com/cdepillabout/servant-static-th/pull/19).
      Thanks [@vendamere](https://github.com/vendamere)!

  ## v0.2.4.0

  -   Add a mime type for .wasm files
      [#17](https://github.com/cdepillabout/servant-static-th/pull/17).
      Thanks again [@spencertipping](https://github.com/spencertipping)!

  ## v0.2.3.0

  -   Add a mime type for .map files
      [#15](https://github.com/cdepillabout/servant-static-th/pull/15). Thanks
      [@spencertipping](https://github.com/spencertipping)!

  ## v0.2.2.1

  -   Update haddocks with a note to use `extra-source-files` in your `.cabal`
      file.  Thanks [fkellner](https://github.com/fkellner)! [#8](https://github.com/cdepillabout/servant-static-th/pull/8)

  ## v0.2.2.0

  -   This adds MIME types for json, xml, gex.  Thanks [delanoe](https://github.com/delanoe)!  [#5](https://github.com/cdepillabout/servant-static-th/pull/5)

  ## v0.2.1.0

  -   This was mistakenly released to Hackage without exposing the constructors added in [#5](https://github.com/cdepillabout/servant-static-th/pull/5)).  It has been blacklisted on Hackage.

  ## v0.2.0.1

  -   In v0.2.0.0, the new MIME types were not being exported from `Servant.Static.TH`.  This fixes that.

  ## v0.2.0.0

  -   Add
      [support](https://github.com/cdepillabout/servant-static-th/pull/4#pullrequestreview-102307694)
      for ico, eot, ttf, woff, and woff2 file.  Thanks [Alex](https://github.com/delanoe)!

  ## v0.1.0.6

  -   Make it more efficient to embed bytestring filetypes.
  -   Make everything other than HTML files be embedded as bytestrings.  Don't
      assume UTF8 encoding.
