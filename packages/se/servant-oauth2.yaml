  # servant-oauth2

  This is a modern servant wrapper around the
  [wai-middleware-auth](https://github.com/fpco/wai-middleware-auth) OAuth2
  provider implementations.


  #### Hacking

  [Simplest example](./servant-oauth2-examples/src/Servant/OAuth2/Examples/Simple.hs):

  ```
  ./hack example-basic
  ```

  [Cookie example](./servant-oauth2-examples/src/Servant/OAuth2/Examples/Cookies.hs):
  ```
  ./hack example-cookies
  ```

  [Example that performs "authorisation"](./servant-oauth2-examples/src/Servant/OAuth2/Examples/Authorisation.hs) (i.e. there is an 'admin' section):
  ```
  ./hack example-auth
  ```

  #### Before running

  You'll need to make a GitHub OAuth application, and a Google one, if you want
  to test that as well.

  The details of which you'll need to place in `./config.toml`. See
  `./config.example.toml` for an example.

  The most important detail is that the callback URL on github, and in the
  config, is set to the same thing:

  ```
  http://localhost:8080/auth/github/complete
  ```

  #### Todo

  - [ ] Contributing guide
  - [x] Document exported functions
  - [x] More detailed readme documentation
  - [x] Build in an example of 'Authorisation'; i.e. lifting the logins to the type-level
  - [x] Show an example of multiple auths (distinguish by type)
  - [x] See if we can get away with only doing it for `complete`
  - [x] Pass settings through somehow
  - [x] Try and hide away as much details as possible
  - [x] Define a basic structure following `AuthProtect`
