  Dependencies](https://img.shields.io/hackage-deps/v/selda.svg)\n\n\nWhat is Selda?\n==============\n[Selda](https://selda.link)
  is a Haskell library for interacting with SQL-based relational databases.\nIt was
  inspired by [LINQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query) and\n[Opaleye](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/opaleye).\n\n\nFeatures\n========\n\n*
  Monadic interface.\n* Portable: backends for SQLite and PostgreSQL.\n* Generic:
  easy integration with your existing Haskell types.\n* Creating, dropping and querying
  tables using type-safe database schemas.\n* Typed query language with products,
  filtering, joins and aggregation.\n* Inserting, updating and deleting rows from
  tables.\n* Conditional insert/update.\n* Transactions, uniqueness constraints and
  foreign keys.\n* Seamless prepared statements.\n* Configurable, automatic, consistent
  in-process caching of query results.\n* Lightweight and modular: few dependencies,
  and non-essential features are\n  optional or split into add-on packages.\n\n\nGetting
  started\n===============\n\nInstall the `selda` package from Hackage, as well as
  at least one of the\nbackends:\n\n    $ cabal update\n    $ cabal install selda
  selda-sqlite selda-postgresql\n\nThen, read the tutorial.\nThe [API documentation](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/selda)
  will probably\nalso come in handy.\n\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nSelda requires
  GHC 7.10+, as well as SQLite 3.7.11+ or PostgreSQL 9+.\nTo build the SQLite backend,
  you need a C compiler installed.\nTo build the PostgreSQL backend, you need the
  `libpq` development libraries\ninstalled (`libpq-dev` on Debian-based Linux distributions).\n\n\nA
  brief tutorial\n================\n\nDefining a schema\n-----------------\n\nTo work
  productively with Selda, you will need to enable the `TypeOperators` and\n`OverloadedStrings`
  extensions.\n\nTable schemas are defined as the product of one or more columns,
  stitched\ntogether using the `:*:` operator.\nA table is parameterized over the
  types of its columns, with the column types\nalso separated by the `:*:` operator.
  This, by the way, is why you need\n`TypeOperators`.\n\n```\npeople :: Table (Text
  :*: Int :*: Maybe Text)\npeople = table \"people\" $ primary \"name\" :*: required
  \"age\" :*: optional \"pet\"\n\naddresses :: Table (Text :*: Text)\naddresses =
  table \"addresses\" $ required \"name\" :*: required \"city\"\n```\n\nColumns may
  be either `required` or `optional`.\nAlthough the SQL standard supports nullable
  primary keys, Selda primary keys\nare always required.\n\n\nRunning queries\n---------------\n\nSelda
  operations are run in the `SeldaT` monad transformer, which can be layered\non top
  of any `MonadIO`. Throughout this tutorial, we will simply use the Selda\nmonad
  `SeldaM`, which is just a synonym for `SeldaT IO`.\n`SeldaT` is entered using a
  backend-specific `withX` function. For instance,\nthe SQLite backend uses the `withSQLite`
  function:\n\n```\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = withSQLite \"my_database.sqlite\" $ do\n
  \ people <- getAllPeople\n  liftIO (print people)\n\ngetAllPeople :: SeldaM [Text
  :*: Int :*: Maybe Text]\ngetAllPeople = query (select people)\n```\n\nThis will
  open the `my_database.sqlite` database for the duration of the\ncomputation. If
  the computation terminates normally, or if it raises an\nexception, the database
  is automatically closed.\n\nNote the somewhat weird return type of `getAllPeople`.
  In Selda, queries are\nrepresented using *inductive tuples*: a list of values, separated\nby
  the `:*:` operator, but where each element can have a different type.\nYou can think
  of them as tuples with a slightly different syntax.\nIn this example, `getAllPeople`
  having a return type of\n`[Text :*: Int :*: Maybe Text]` means that it returns a
  list of \"3-tuples\",\nwhere the three elements have the types `Text`, `Int` and
  `Maybe Text`\nrespectively.\n\nYou can pattern match on these values as you would
  on normal tuples:\n\n```\nfirstOfThree :: (a :*: b :*: c) -> a\nfirstOfThree (a
  :*: b :*: c) = a\n```\n\nSince inductive tuples are inductively defined, you may
  also choose to pattern\nmatch on just the first few elements:\n\n```\nfirstOfN ::
  (a :*: rest) -> a\nfirstOfN (a :*: _) = a\n```\n\nThroughout the rest of this tutorial,
  we will simply use inductive tuples as if\nthey were \"normal\" tuples.\n\n\nCreating
  and deleting databases\n-------------------------------\n\nYou can use a table definition
  to create the corresponding table in your\ndatabase backend, as well as delete it.\n\n```\nsetup
  :: SeldaM ()\nsetup = do\n  createTable people\n  createTable addresses\n\nteardown
  :: SeldaM ()\nteardown = do\n  tryDropTable people\n  tryDropTable addresses\n```\n\nBoth
  creating and deleting tables comes in two variants: the `try` version\nwhich is
  a silent no-op when attempting to create a table that already exists\nor delete
  one that doesn't, and the \"plain\" version which raises an error.\n\n\nInserting
  data\n--------------\n\nData insertion is done in batches. To insert a batch of
  rows, pass a list of\nrows where each row is an inductive tuple matching the type
  of the table.\nOptional values are encoded as `Maybe` values.\n\n```\npopulate ::
  SeldaM ()\npopulate = do\n  insert_ people\n    [ \"Link\"      :*: 125 :*: Just
  \"horse\"\n    , \"Velvet\"    :*: 19  :*: Nothing\n    , \"Kobayashi\" :*: 23  :*:
  Just \"dragon\"\n    , \"Miyu\"      :*: 10  :*: Nothing\n    ]\n  insert_ addresses\n
  \   [ \"Link\"      :*: \"Kakariko\"\n    , \"Kobayashi\" :*: \"Tokyo\"\n    , \"Miyu\"
  \     :*: \"Fuyukishi\"\n    ]\n```\n\nInsertions come in two variants: the \"plain\"
  version which reports back the\nnumber of inserted rows, and one appended with an
  underscore which returns `()`.\nUse the latter to explicitly indicate your intent
  to ignore the return value.\n\nThe following example inserts a few rows into a table
  with an\nauto-incrementing primary key:\n\n```\npeople' :: Table (RowID :*: Text
  :*: Int :*: Maybe Text)\npeople' = table \"people_with_ids\"\n  $   autoPrimary
  \"id\"\n  :*: required \"name\"\n  :*: required \"age\"\n  :*: optional \"pet\"\n\npopulate'
  :: SeldaM ()\npopulate' = do\n  insert_ people'\n    [ def :*: \"Link\"      :*:
  125 :*: Just \"horse\"\n    , def :*: \"Velvet\"    :*: 19  :*: Nothing\n    , def
  :*: \"Kobayashi\" :*: 23  :*: Just \"dragon\"\n    , def :*: \"Miyu\"      :*: 10
  \ :*: Nothing\n    ]\n```\n\nNote the use of the `def` value for the `id` field.
  This indicates that the\ndefault value for the column should be used in lieu of
  any user-provided value.\nSince the `id` field is an auto-incrementing primary key,
  it will automatically\nbe assigned a unique, increasing value.\nThus, the resulting
  table would look like this:\n\n```\nid | name      | age | pet\n-----------------------------\n
  0 | Link      | 125 | horse\n 1 | Velvet    | 19  |\n 2 | Kobayashi | 23  | dragon\n
  3 | Miyu      | 10  |\n```\n\nAuto-incrementing primary keys must always have the
  type `RowID`.\n\n\nUpdating rows\n-------------\n\nTo update a table, pass the table
  and two functions to the `update` function.\nThe first is a predicate over table
  columns. The second is a mapping over table \ncolumns, specifying how to update
  each row. Only rows satisfying the predicate \nare updated.\n\n```\nage10Years ::
  SeldaM ()\nage10Years = do\n  update_ people (\\(name :*: _ :*: _) -> name ./= \"Link\")\n
  \                (\\(name :*: age :*: pet) -> name :*: age + 10 :*: pet)\n```\n\nNote
  that you can use arithmetic, logic and other standard SQL operations on\nthe columns
  in either function. Columns implement the appropriate numeric\ntype classes. For
  operations with less malleable types -- logic and\ncomparisons, for instance --
  the standard Haskell operators are prefixed\nwith a period (`.`).\n\n\nDeleting
  rows\n-------------\n\nDeleting rows is quite similar to updating them. The only
  difference is that\nthe `deleteFrom` operation takes a table and a predicate, specifying
  which rows\nto delete.\nThe following example deletes all minors from the `people`
  table:\n\n```\nbyeMinors :: SeldaM ()\nbyeMinors = deleteFrom_ people (\\(_ :*:
  age :*: _) -> age .< 20)\n```\n\n\nBasic queries\n-------------\n\nQueries are written
  in the `Query` monad, in which you can query tables,\nrestrict the result set, and
  perform inner, aggregate queries.\nQueries are executed in some Selda monad using
  the `query` function.\n\nThe following example uses the `select` operation to draw
  each row from the\n`people` table, and the `restrict` operation to remove out all
  rows except\nthose having an `age` column with a value greater than 20.\n\n\n```\ngrownups
  :: Query s (Col s Text)\ngrownups = do\n  (name :*: age :*: _) <- select people\n
  \ restrict (age .> 20)\n  return name\n\nprintGrownups :: SeldaM ()\nprintGrownups
  = do\n  names <- query grownups\n  liftIO (print names)\n```\n\nYou may have noticed
  that in addition to the return type of a query,\nthe `Query` type has an additional
  type parameter `s`.\nWe'll cover this parameter in more detail when we get to\naggregating
  queries, so for now you can just ignore it.\n\n\nSelector functions\n------------------\n\nIt's
  often annoying to explicitly take the tuples returned by queries apart.\nFor this
  reason, Selda provides a function `selectors` to generate\n*selectors*: identifiers
  which can be used with the `!` operator to access\nelements of inductive tuples
  similar to how record selectors are used to access\nfields of standard Haskell record
  types.\n\nRewriting the previous example using selector functions:\n\n```\nname
  :*: age :*: pet = selectors people\n\ngrownups :: Query s (Col s Text)\ngrownups
  = do\n  p <- select people\n  restrict (p ! age .> 20)\n  return (p ! name)\n\nprintGrownups
  :: SeldaM ()\nprintGrownups = do\n  names <- query grownups\n  liftIO (print names)\n```\n\nFor
  added convenience, the `tableWithSelectors` function creates both a table\nand its
  selector functions at the same time:\n\n```\nposts :: Table (RowID :*: Maybe Text
  :*: Text)\n(posts, postId :*: author :*: content)\n  =   tableWithSelectors \"posts\"\n
  \ $   autoPrimary \"id\"\n  :*: optional \"author\"\n  :*: required \"content\"\n\nallAuthors
  :: Query s Text\nallAuthors = do\n  p <- select posts\n  return (p ! author)\n```\n\nYou
  can also use selectors with the `with` function to update columns in a tuple.\n`with`
  takes a tuple and a list of *assignments*, where each assignment is a\nselector-value
  pair. For each assignment, the column indicated by the selector\nwill be set to
  the corresponding value, on the given tuple.\n\n```\ngrownupsIn10Years :: Query
  s (Col s Text)\ngrownupsIn10Years = do\n  p <- select people\n  let p' = p `with`
  [age := p ! age + 10]\n  restrict (p' ! age .> 20)\n  return (p' ! name)\n```\n\nOf
  course, selectors can be used for updates and deletions as well.\n\nFor the remainder
  of this tutorial, we'll keep matching on the tuples\nexplicitly.\n\n\nProducts and
  joins\n------------------\n\nOf course, data can be drawn from multiple tables.
  The unfiltered result set\nis essentially the cartesian product of all queried tables.\nFor
  this reason, `restrict` calls should be made as early as possible, to avoid\ncreating
  an unnecessarily large result set.\n\nArbitrary Haskell values can be injected into
  queries. As injected values are\npassed as parameters to prepared statements under
  the hood, there is no need\nto escape data; SQL injection is impossible by construction.\n\nThe
  following example uses data from two tables to find all grown-ups who\nreside in
  Tokyo. Note the use of the `text` function, to convert a Haskell\n`Text` value into
  an SQL column literal, as well as the use of `name .== name'`\nto remove all elements
  from the result set where the name in the `people` table\ndoes not match the one
  in the `addresses` table.\n\n```\ngrownupsIn :: Text -> Query s (Col s Text)\ngrownupsIn
  city = do\n  (name :*: age :*: _) <- select people\n  restrict (age .> 20)\n  (name'
  :*: home) <- select addresses\n  restrict (home .== text city .&& name .== name')\n
  \ return name\n\nprintGrownupsInTokyo :: SeldaM ()\nprintGrownupsInTokyo = do\n
  \ names <- query (grownupsIn \"Tokyo\")\n  liftIO (print names)\n```\n\nAlso note
  that this is slightly different from an SQL join. If, for instance,\nyou wanted
  to get a list of all people and their addresses, you might do\nsomething like this:\n\n```\nallPeople
  :: Query s (Col s Text :*: Col s Text)\nallPeople = do\n  (people_name :*: _ :*:
  _) <- select people\n  (addresses_name :*: city) <- select addresses\n  restrict
  (people_name .== addresses_name)\n  return (people_name :*: city)\n```\n\nThis will
  give you the list of everyone who has an address, resulting in the\nfollowing result
  set:\n\n```\nname      | city\n---------------------\nLink      | Kakariko\nKobayashi
  | Tokyo\nMiyu      | Fuyukishi\n```\n\nNote the absence of Velvet in this result
  set. Since there is no entry for\nVelvet in the `addresses` table, there can be
  no entry in the product table\n`people × addresses` where both `people_name` and
  `addresses_name` are equal\nto `\"Velvet\"`. To produce a table like the above but
  with a `NULL` column for\nVelvet's address (or for anyone else who does not have
  an entry in the\n`addresses` table), you would have to use a join:\n\n```\nallPeople'
  :: Query s (Col s Text :*: Col s (Maybe Text))\nallPeople' = do\n  (name :*: _ :*:
  _) <- select people\n  (_ :*: city) <- leftJoin (\\(name' :*: _) -> name .== name')\n
  \                          (select addresses)\n  return (name :*: city)\n```\n\nThis
  gives us the result table we want:\n\n```\nname      | city\n---------------------\nLink
  \     | Kakariko\nVelvet    |\nKobayashi | Tokyo\nMiyu      | Fuyukishi\n\n```\n\nThe
  `leftJoin` function left joins its query argument to the current result set\nfor
  all rows matching its predicate argument.\nNote that all columns returned from the
  inner (or right) query are converted by\n`leftJoin` into nullable columns. As there
  may not be a right counter part for\nevery element in the result set, SQL and Selda
  alike set any missing joined\ncolumns to `NULL`.\n\n\nAggregate queries, grouping
  and sorting\n---------------------------------------\n\nYou can also perform queries
  that sum, count, or otherwise aggregate their\nresult sets. This is done using the
  `aggregate` function.\nThis is where the additional type parameter to `Query` comes
  into play.\nWhen used as an inner query, aggregate queries must not depend on any
  columns\nfrom the outer query. To enforce this, the `aggregate` function forces
  all\noperations to take place in the `Query (Inner s)` monad, if the outer query\ntakes
  place in the `Query s` monad. This ensures that aggregate inner queries\ncan only
  communicate with their outside query by returning some value.\n\nLike in standard
  SQL, aggregate queries can be grouped by column name or by\nsome arbitrary expression.\nAn
  aggregate subquery must return at least one aggregate column, obtained using\n`sum_`,
  `avg`, `count`, or one of the other provided aggregate functions.\nNote that aggregate
  columns, having type `Aggr s a`, are different from normal\ncolumns of type `Col
  s a`.\nSince SQL does not allow aggregate functions in `WHERE` clauses, Selda prevents\nthem
  from being used in arguments to `restrict`.\n\nThe following example uses an aggregate
  query to calculate how many home each\nperson has, and order the result set with
  the most affluent homeowners at the\ntop.\n\n```\ncountHomes :: Query s (Col s Text
  :*: Col s Int)\ncountHomes = do\n  (name :*: _ :*: _) <- select people\n  (owner
  :*: homes) <- aggregate $ do\n    (owner :*: city) <- select addresses\n    owner'
  <- groupBy owner\n    return (owner' :*: count city)\n  restrict (owner .== name)\n
  \ order homes descending\n  return (owner :*: homes)\n```\n\nNote how `groupBy`
  returns an aggregate version of its argument, which can be\nreturned from the aggregate
  query. In this example, returning `owner` instead of\n`owner'` wouldn't work since
  the former is a plain column and not an aggregate.\n\n\nTransactions\n------------\n\nAll
  databases supported by Selda guarantee that each query is atomic: either\nthe entire
  query is performed in one go, with no observable intermediate state,\nor the whole
  query fails without leaving a trace in the database.\nHowever, sometimes this guarantee
  is not enough.\nConsider, for instance, a money transfer from Alice's bank account
  to Bob's.\nThis involves at least two queries: one to remove the money from\nAlice's
  account, and one to add the same amount to Bob's.\nClearly, it would be *bad* if
  this operation were to be interrupted after\nwithdrawing the money from Alice's
  account but before depositing it into Bob's.\n\nThe solution to this problem is
  *transactions*: a mechanism by which\n*a list of queries* gain the same atomicity
  guarantees as a single query always\nenjoys. Using transactions in Selda is super
  easy:\n\n```\ntransferMoney :: Text -> Text -> Double -> SeldaM ()\ntransferMoney
  from to amount = do\n  transaction $ do\n    update_ accounts (\\(owner :*: _) ->
  owner .== text from)\n                     (\\(owner :*: money) -> owner :*: money
  - float amount)\n    update_ accounts (\\(owner :*: _) -> owner .== text to)\n                     (\\(owner
  :*: money) -> owner :*: money + float amount)\n```\n\nThis is all there is to it:
  pass the entire computation to the `transaction`\nfunction, and the whole computation
  is guaranteed to either execute atomically,\nor to fail without leaving a trace
  in the database.\nIf an exception is raised during the computation, it will of course
  be rolled\nback.\n\nDo be careful, however, to avoid performing IO within a query.\nWhile
  they will not affect the atomicity of the computation as far as the\ndatabase is
  concerned, the computations themselves can obviously not be\nrolled back.\n\n\nIn-process
  caching\n------------------\n\nIn many applications, read operations are orders
  of magnitude more common than\nwrite operations. For such applications, it is often
  useful to *cache* the\nresults of a query, to avoid having the database perform
  the same, potentially\nheavy, query over and over even though we *know* we'll get
  the same result\nevery time.\n\nSelda supports automatic caching of query results
  out of the box.\nHowever, it is turned off by default.\nTo enable caching, use the
  `setLocalCache` function.\n\n```\nmain = withPostgreSQL connection_info $ do\n  setLocalCache
  1000\n  ...\n```\n\nThis will enable local caching of up to 1,000 different results.\nWhen
  that limit is reached, the least recently used result will be discarded,\nso the
  next request for that result will need to actually execute the query\non the database
  backend.\nIf caching was already enabled, changing the maximum number of cached
  results\nwill discard the cache's previous contents.\nSetting the cache limit to
  0 disables caching again.\n\nTo make sure that the cache is always consistent with
  the underlying database,\nSelda keeps track of which tables each query depends on.\nWhenever
  an insert, update, delete or drop is issued on a table `t`, all cached\nqueries
  that depend on `t` will be discarded.\n\nThis guarantees consistency between cache
  and database, but *only* under the\nassumption that *no other process will modify
  the database*.\nIf this assumption does not hold for your application, you should
  avoid using\nin-process caching.\nIt is perfectly fine, however, to have multiple
  *threads* within the same\napplication modifying the same database as long as they're
  all using Selda\nto do it, as the cache is shared between all Selda computations\nrunning
  in the same process.\n\n\nGeneric tables and queries\n--------------------------\n\nSelda
  also supports building tables and queries from (almost) arbitrary\ndata types, using
  the `Database.Selda.Generic` module.\nRe-implementing the ad hoc `people` and `addresses`
  tables from before in a\nmore disciplined manner in this way is quite easy:\n\n```\ndata
  Person = Person\n  { personName :: Text\n  , age        :: Int\n  , pet        ::
  Maybe Int\n  } deriving Generic\n\ndata Address = Address\n  { addrName :: Text\n
  \ , city     :: Text\n  } deriving Generic\n\n\npeople :: GenTable Person\npeople
  = genTable \"people\" [personName :- primaryGen]\n\naddresses :: GenTable Address\naddresses
  = genTable \"addresses\" [personName :- primaryGen]\n```\n\nThis will declare two
  tables with the same structure as their ad hoc\npredecessors. Creating the tables
  is similarly easy:\n\n```\ncreate :: SeldaM ()\ncreate = do\n  createTable (gen
  people)\n  createTable (gen addresses)\n```\n\nNote the use of the `gen` function
  here, to extract the underlying table of\ncolumns from the generic table.\n\nHowever,
  queries over generic tables aren't magic; they still consist of the\nsame collections
  of columns as queries over non-generic tables.\n\n```\ngenericGrownups2 :: Query
  s (Col s Text)\ngenericGrownups2 = do\n  (name :*: age :*: _) <- select (gen people)\n
  \ restrict (age .> 20)\n  return name\n```\n\nFinally, with generics it's also quite
  easy to re-assemble Haskell objects\nfrom the results of a query using the `fromRel`
  function.\n\n```\ngetPeopleOfAge :: Int -> SeldaM [Person]\ngetPeopleOfAge yrs =
  do\n  ps <- query $ do\n    (name :*: age :*: _) <- select (gen people)\n    restrict
  (age .== yrs)\n    return p\n  return (map fromRel ps)\n```\n\n\nPrepared statements\n-------------------\n\nWhile
  Selda makes use of prepared statements internally to ensure that any and\nall input
  is safely escaped, it does not reuse those statements by default.\nEvery query is
  recompiler and replanned each time it is executed.\nTo improve the performance of
  your code, you should make use of the `prepared`\nfunction, to mark performance-critical
  queries as reusable.\n\nThe `prepared` function converts any function `f` in the
  `Query` monad into an\nequivalent function `f'` in some `MonadSelda`, provided that
  all of `f`'s\narguments are column expressions.\nWhen `f'` is called for the first
  time during a connection to a database, it\nautomatically gets compiled, prepared
  and cached before being executed.\nAny subsequent calls to `f'` from the same connection
  will reuse the prepared\nversion.\n\nNote that since most database engines don't
  allow prepared statements to persist\nacross connections, a previously cached statement
  will get prepared once more if\ncalled from another connection.\n\nAs an example,
  we modify the `grownupsIn` function we saw earlier to use prepared\nstatements.\n\n```\npreparedGrownupsIn
  :: Text -> SeldaM [Text]\npreparedGrownupsIn = prepared $ \\city -> do\n  (name
  :*: age :*: _) <- select people\n  restrict (age .> 20)\n  (name' :*: home) <- select
  addresses\n  restrict (home .== city .&& name .== name')\n  return name\n```\n\nNote
  that the type of the `city` argument is `Col s Text` within the query, but\nwhen
  *calling* `preparedGrownupsIn`, we instead pass in a value of type `Text`;\nfor
  convenience, `prepared` automatically converts all arguments to\nprepared functions
  into their equivalent column types.\n\n\nForeign keys\n------------\n\nTo add a
  foreign key constraint on a column, use the `fk` function.\nThis function takes
  two parameters: a column of the table being defined, and\na tuple of the `(table,
  column)` the foreign key refers to.\nThe table identifier is simply a value of type
  `Table t`, while the column\nis specified using a selector of type `Selector t a`.\n\nThe
  following example creates a table to store users, and one to store blog\nposts.
  The `users` table stores a name, a password, and a unique identifier\nfor each user.\nThe
  `posts` table stores, for each post, the post body, a unique\npost identifier, and
  the identifier of the user who wrote the post.\nThe column storing a post's author
  has a foreign key constraint on the `userid`\ncolumn of the `users` table, to ensure
  that each post has a valid author.\n\n```\nusers :: Table (RowID :*: Text)\nusers
  = table \"users\"\n  $   primary \"userid\"\n  :*: required \"username\"\n  :*:
  required \"password\"\n(userId :*: userName :*: userPass) = selectors users\n\nposts
  :: Table (RowID :*: RowID :*: Text)\nposts = table \"posts\"\n  $   primary \"postid\"\n
  \ :*: required \"authorid\" `fk` (users, userId)\n  :*: required \"post_body\"\n```\n\nNote
  that a foreign key can *only* refer to a column which is either\na primary key or
  has a unique constraint. This is not specific to Selda, but\na restriction of SQL.\n\nAnd
  with that, we conclude this tutorial. Hopefully it has been enough to get\nyou comfortably
  started using Selda.\nFor a more detailed API reference, please see Selda's\n[Haddock
  documentation](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/selda).\n\n\nHacking\n=======\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nAll
  forms of contributions are welcome!\n\nIf you have a bug to report, please try to
  include as much information as\npossible, preferably including:\n\n* A brief description
  (one or two sentences) of the bug.\n* The version of Selda+backend where the bug
  was found.\n* A step-by-step guide to reproduce the bug.\n* The *expected* result
  from following these steps.\n* What *actually* happens when following the steps.\n*
  Which component contains the bug (selda, selda-sqlite or selda-postgresql),\n  if
  you're reasonably sure about where the bug is.\n\nBonus points for a small code
  example that illustrates the problem.\n\nIf you want to contribute code, please
  consult the following checklist before\nsending a pull request:\n\n* Does the code
  build with a recent version of GHC?\n* Do all the tests pass?\n* Have you added
  any tests covering your code?\n\n\nSetting up the build environment\n--------------------------------\n\nFrom
  the repository root:\n\n* Install `libpq-dev` from your package manager.\n    This
  is required to build the PostgreSQL backend.\n* Run `make sandbox` followed by `make
  deps`.\n    This will set up a local sandbox for your Selda hacking, and install
  all\n    Haskell necessary dependencies.\n* Familiarise yourself with the various
  targets in the makefile.\n    The dependencies between Selda, the backends and the
  tests are slightly\n    complex, so straight-up cabal is too quirky for day to day
  hacking.\n\n\nSetting up a VM for PostgreSQL testing\n--------------------------------------\n\nWhile
  the SQLite backend is completely self-contained, the PostgreSQL backend\nneeds an
  appropriate server for testing. Setting this up in a virtual machine\nis definitely
  less intrusive than setting up a server on your development\nmachine. To set up
  a VM for the PostgreSQL backend tests:\n\n* Install your favourite hypervisor, such
  as VMWare player or VirtualBox.\n* Download a pre-built PostgreSQL VM from\n    [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com/stack/postgresql/virtual-machine).\n*
  Import the OVA file into your hypervisor.\n* Change the network settings of your
  newly imported VM to NAT, and make sure\n    that port 5432 is forwarded. Note that
  this will conflict with any PostgreSQL\n    server running on your machine while
  the VM is running.\n* Boot your VM and note the password displayed on the login
  screen.\n* Create the file `selda-tests/PGConnectInfo.hs` with the following content:\n
  \   ```\n    {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}\n    module PGConnectInfo where\n
  \   import Database.Selda.PostgreSQL\n    \n    pgConnectInfo = \"test\" `on` \"localhost\"
  `auth` (\"postgres\", \"$PASSWORD\")\n    ```\n    Where `$PASSWORD` is the password
  from the VM's login screen.\n* Log in to the VM and disable the built-in firewall
  by running\n    `sudo systemctl disable ufw ; sudo systemctl stop ufw`.\n* From
  your host machine, create the test database:\n    ```\n    $ psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U
  postgres -W\n    [password from login screen]\n    # CREATE TABLE test;\n    # \\q\n
  \   ```\n* Run `make pgtest` to check that everything works.\n\n\nTODOs\n-----\n\nFeatures
  that would be nice to have but are not yet implemented.\n\n* Monadic if/else.\n*
  Streaming\n* Type-safe migrations\n* `SELECT INTO`.\n* Database schema upgrades.\n*
  Stack build.\n* MySQL/MariaDB backend.\n* Automatically sanity check changelog,
  versions and date before release.\n"
