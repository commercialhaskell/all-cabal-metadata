description: |-
  Having positional parameters in @servant@ can be error-prone, especially when there are a lot of them and they have similar types.
  This package solves that problem by letting one use records to specify query parameters in @servant@ APIs.
  Use [servant-queryparam-server](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant-queryparam-server) for servers and [servant-queryparam-client](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant-queryparam-client) for clients.
