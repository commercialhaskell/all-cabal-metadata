description: ! "# Pipes-Safe v2.3.0\n\n`pipes-safe` builds upon\n[the `pipes` library](https://github.com/Gabriel439/Haskell-Pipes-Library)
  to\nprovide exception safety and resource management.\n\n## Quick start\n\n* Install
  the [Haskell Platform](http://www.haskell.org/platform/)\n* `cabal install pipes-safe`\n\nThe
  official tutorial is on\n[Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-safe).\n\n##
  Features\n\n* *Resource Safety*: Guarantee finalization using `finally`, `bracket`,
  and more\n\n* *Exception Safety*: Even against asynchronous exceptions!\n\n* *Laziness*:
  Only acquire resources when you need them\n\n* *Promptness*: Finalize resources
  early when you are done with them\n\n* *Native Exception Handling*: Catch and resume
  from exceptions inside pipes\n\n* *No Buy-in*: Mix resource-safe pipes with unmanaged
  pipes using `hoist`\n\n## Outline\n\nUse `pipes-safe` for production code where
  you need deterministic and prompt\nrelease of resources in the fact of exceptions
  or premature pipe termination.\n`pipes-safe` lets you safely acquire resources and
  handle exceptions within\npipelines.\n\n## Development Status\n\n`pipes-safe` is
  mostly stable.  Research into prompter finalization alternatives\nwill take place
  in a separate library.\n\n## Community Resources\n\nUse the same resources as the
  core `pipes` library to learn more, contribute, or\nrequest help:\n\n* [Haskell
  wiki page](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Pipes)\n\n* [Mailing list](mailto:haskell-pipes@googlegroups.com)
  ([Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/haskell-pipes))\n\n##
  How to contribute\n\n* Build derived libraries\n\n* Write `pipes-safe` tutorials\n\n##
