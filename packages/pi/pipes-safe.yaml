  # Pipes-Safe v2.3.1

  `pipes-safe` builds upon
  [the `pipes` library](https://github.com/Gabriel439/Haskell-Pipes-Library) to
  provide exception safety and resource management.

  ## Quick start

  * Install the [Haskell Platform](http://www.haskell.org/platform/)
  * `cabal install pipes-safe`

  The official tutorial is on
  [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-safe).

  ## Features

  * *Resource Safety*: Guarantee finalization using `finally`, `bracket`, and more

  * *Exception Safety*: Even against asynchronous exceptions!

  * *Laziness*: Only acquire resources when you need them

  * *Promptness*: Finalize resources early when you are done with them

  * *Native Exception Handling*: Catch and resume from exceptions inside pipes

  * *No Buy-in*: Mix resource-safe pipes with unmanaged pipes using `hoist`

  ## Outline

  Use `pipes-safe` for production code where you need deterministic and prompt
  release of resources in the fact of exceptions or premature pipe termination.
  `pipes-safe` lets you safely acquire resources and handle exceptions within
  pipelines.

  ## Development Status

  `pipes-safe` is mostly stable.  Research into prompter finalization alternatives
  will take place in a separate library.

  ## Community Resources

  Use the same resources as the core `pipes` library to learn more, contribute, or
  request help:

  * [Haskell wiki page](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Pipes)

  * [Mailing list](mailto:haskell-pipes@googlegroups.com) ([Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/haskell-pipes))

  ## How to contribute

  * Build derived libraries

  * Write `pipes-safe` tutorials
