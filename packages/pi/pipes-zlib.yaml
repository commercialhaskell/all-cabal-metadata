changelog: |
  # Version 0.4.4.2

  * Remove upper bound from all dependencies except `base`.


  # Version 0.4.4.1

  * Bump upper bound dependency on `pipes`.


  # Version 0.4.4

  * Depend on `streaming-commons` instead of `zlib` and `zlib-bindings`,
    as the latter are deprecated.

  * Add `Pipes.Zlib.decompress'` and `Pipes.GZip.decompress'`.

  * Bump upper bound dependency on `transformers`.

  * Add tests.


  # Version 0.4.3

  * Fix usage of the `Producer'` type synonym (#14).


  # Version 0.4.2.1

  * Fix “Codec.Compression.Zlib: premature end of compressed stream” (#13)


  # Version 0.4.2

  * Added the `Pipes/GZip.hs` file that was missing in 0.4.1.


  # Version 0.4.1

  * Added `Pipes.GZip` module.


  # Version 0.4.0.1

  * Bump upper bound dependency on `transformers`.


  # Version 0.4.0

  * Backwards incompatible API. `compress` and `decompress` are now
    functions of `Producer'`s as they need to perform actions at the
    beginning and end of input. (Issue #3)


  # Version 0.3.1

  * Dependency upper bounds.


  # Version 0.3.0

  * Upgraded to work with pipes-4.0.0, creating a new backwards
    incompatible API.

  * Generalize base `IO` monad to `MonadIO`.


  # Version 0.2.0.0

  * New backwards incompatible API.

  * Based on pipes-3.3 and zlib-bindings.


  # Up to version 0.1.0

  * Based on pipes-core and zlib-bindings.
