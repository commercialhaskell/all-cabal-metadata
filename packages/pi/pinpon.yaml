  # pinpon

  `pinpon` is a silly little service that implements an
  Internet-enabled doorbell in Haskell, using
  [Amazon Simple Notification Service](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) to notify
  subscribers that the button has been pushed. Effectively, it's a
  simple REST service which, when `POST`ed to, will send a notification
  to an SNS topic. You can then build a client application which
  subscribes to that topic and notifies the user when the doorbell has
  been pressed. No such client application is included in the `pinpon`
  package, but an iOS app may be made available at some point in the
  future.

  The package provides a `pinpon-gpio` executable, intended for use on
  Linux systems with GPIO functionality. When the specified GPIO pin is
  triggered (e.g., via a momentary switch such as
  [this one](https://www.e-switch.com/product-catalog/anti-vandal/product-lines/pv3-series-illuminated-sealed-long-life-anti-vandal-switches#.WHW8_7GZNE4)),
  `pinpon-gpio` will `POST` a notification to the specified `pinpon`
  server.

  Why not simply build the Amazon SNS functionality into the
  `pinpon-gpio` executable and eliminate the `pinpon` REST service?
  Chiefly because the host system running the `pinpon-gpio` executable
  may be particularly vulnerable to physical attacks (after all, it is
  presumably hooked up to a doorbell button that is exposed in a public
  space). I did not feel comfortable storing my Amazon AWS credentials
  on such a device, nor even allowing such a device to communicate
  directly with the public Internet. By proxying the AWS access via a
  more physically secure host running the `pinpon` server on my internal
  network, I can better protect my AWS credentials and limit network
  access on the GPIO device to just the `pinpon` service.
