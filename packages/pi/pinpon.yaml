description: ! '# pinpon


  `pinpon` is a silly little service that implements an

  Internet-enabled doorbell in Haskell, using

  [Amazon Simple Notification Service](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) to notify

  subscribers that the button has been pushed. Effectively, it''s a

  simple REST service which, when `POST`ed to, will send a notification

  to an SNS topic. You can then build a client application which

  subscribes to that topic and notifies the user when the doorbell has

  been pressed. No such client application is included in the `pinpon`

  package, but an iOS app may be made available at some point in the

  future.


  The package provides a `pinpon-gpio` executable, intended for use on

  Linux systems with GPIO functionality. When the specified GPIO pin is

  triggered (e.g., via a momentary switch such as

  [this one](https://www.e-switch.com/product-catalog/anti-vandal/product-lines/pv3-series-illuminated-sealed-long-life-anti-vandal-switches#.WHW8_7GZNE4)),

  `pinpon-gpio` will `POST` a notification to the specified `pinpon`

  server.


  Why not simply build the Amazon SNS functionality into the

  `pinpon-gpio` executable and eliminate the `pinpon` REST service?

  Chiefly because the host system running the `pinpon-gpio` executable

  may be particularly vulnerable to physical attacks (after all, it is

  presumably hooked up to a doorbell button that is exposed in a public

  space). I did not feel comfortable storing my Amazon AWS credentials

  on such a device, nor even allowing such a device to communicate

  directly with the public Internet. By proxying the AWS access via a

  more physically secure host running the `pinpon` server on my internal

  network, I can better protect my AWS credentials and limit network

  access on the GPIO device to just the `pinpon` service.
