  # pixel-printer
  Pixel-printer is a utility for turning pixel art into 3d prints.

  ## Installation
  Use `stack install pixel-printer` or `cabal install pixel-printer`

  ## Usage
  `stack run filename` or `cabal run pixel-printer-exe filename` will output
  [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/index.html) code to standard out to do as
  you please. To get a file, redirect like so `stack run filename > filename.scad`
  or `cabal run pixel-printer-exe filename > filename.scad`. To get an STL from
  here, open the OpenSCAD code in OpenSCAD.

  Any filetype supported by
  [JuicyPixels](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/JuicyPixels) will work.

  ## Roadmap
  - [x] v0.1 - Reads file given on command line, outputs .scad code to stdout.
        Height, width, length predefined
  - [ ] v0.2 - Command line options for:
      - [ ] invert height
      - [ ] pixel width, pixel length, mutally exclusive with
      - [ ] total width, total length
      - [ ] height
      - [ ] output to a file
  - [ ] v0.3 - stl output
      - [ ] ascii
      - [ ] binary
  - [ ] v0.4 - Presets
      - [ ] lithophane mode
  - [ ] v1.0 - same height pixel output, useful for painting the final product
      - [ ] paint by pixels
