description: ! "## What's in this library?\n\nA pair of fold-like datatypes that consume\n[Producers](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-4.1.7/docs/Pipes.html#t:Producer)\nfrom
  [pipes](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes) and can be constructed\nin a variety
  of ways, in particular from the more versatile folds in Gabriel\nGonzalez's [foldl](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/foldl)
  package.\n\nThe **Fold1** consumes a single **Producer**, while the **Fold2** datatype\nconsumes
  two **Producer**s concurrently.\n\n## Why was this library created?\n\nI wanted
  a fold-like datatype for Producers that allowed \"bracketing\"\noperations like
  \"withFile\".\n\nI also wanted to be able to fold two Producers concurrently (for
  example, merge\nthe piped stdout & stderr streams of an external process into one
  unified\nstream).\n\nFinally, I wanted the fold-like datatype to have a \"failure
  option\" baked in.\n\nIf you don't need any of that, you are better off using **pipes**
  and/or\n**foldl** by themselves. \n\n## Where can I find working examples for this
  library?\n\nThere are none yet.\n"
