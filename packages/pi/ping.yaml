  # ping

  ## Objective

  This library provides high-performance functions that issue ICMP echo
  requests and wait for responses, measuring the elapsed time. It is intended
  to be cross-platform as possible, and it may use any system APIs available.
  However, it will not resort to running `/bin/ping` as a subprocess. Pull
  requests that improve compatibility will accepted so long as they do not
  start a subprocess.

  ## Build Instructions

  This library relies on `posix-api`, which needs a currently-unreleased
  version of `hsc2hs` in order to build. In order to try out this library, try:

  ```
  ~/dev $ git clone https://github.com/haskell/hsc2hs
  ~/dev $ cd hsc2hs
  ~/dev/hsc2hs $ cabal install
  ~/dev/hsc2hs $ cd ..
  ~/dev $ git clone https://github.com/andrewthad/ping
  ~/dev $ cd ping
  ~/dev/ping $ cabal new-build --with-hsc2hs=~/.cabal/bin/hsc2hs
  ```

  This will build all dependencies, including `posix-api`, with the
  upstream `hsc2hs` tool.

  ## Infelicities

  This project's objective is to be cross-platform. However, it does not
  accomplish this. The author primarily runs a Debian Linux distribution
  and consequently lacks the resources and the motivation to make this
  work on other platforms. Contributions to improve compatibility are
  welcomed. Current known problems include:

  - On Linux, the library should fallback to using raw sockets if `IPPROTO_ICMP`
    does not work.
  - Support for Windows is missing.
  - Support for BSD is missing. However, adding raw socket support to improve
    the situation on Linux may fix this as well.
  - Support for Darwin is missing. This should not be difficult since
    Darwin supports `IPPROTO_ICMP` sockets.
