  # Changelog
  All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

  The format is inspired by [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
  This changelog deviates from the recommendation by not grouping changes into
  added, changed, deprecated, etc. subsections.

  This project adheres to the [Haskell Package Versioning Policy](https://pvp.haskell.org/).

  ## [0.1.0.3] - 2019-07-22
  - Library now builds with newer `posix-api-0.3.*` and with
    `primitive-0.7.*`.

  ## [0.1.0.2] - 2019-04-08
  - Not documented

  ## [0.1.0.1] - 2018-01-07
  - Fix a problem in `multihosts` that occassionally caused the function
    to wait for a number of nanoseconds close to `maxBound :: Word64`.
    This had been caused by a subtraction underflow.

  ## [0.1.0.0] - 2018-01-02
  - Initial release.
  - Function `host` for pinging a single host once.
  - Function `hosts` and `range` for pinging multiple hosts once each.
  - Function `multihosts` and `multirange` for pinging multiple hosts once each.

  # ping

  ## Objective

  This library provides high-performance functions that issue ICMP echo
  requests and wait for responses, measuring the elapsed time. It is intended
  to be cross-platform as possible, and it may use any system APIs available.
  However, it will not resort to running `/bin/ping` as a subprocess. Pull
  requests that improve compatibility will accepted so long as they do not
  start a subprocess.

  ## Build Instructions

  This library relies on `posix-api`, which needs a currently-unreleased
  version of `hsc2hs` in order to build. In order to try out this library, try:

  ```
  ~/dev $ git clone https://github.com/haskell/hsc2hs
  ~/dev $ cd hsc2hs
  ~/dev/hsc2hs $ cabal install
  ~/dev/hsc2hs $ cd ..
  ~/dev $ git clone https://github.com/andrewthad/ping
  ~/dev $ cd ping
  ~/dev/ping $ cabal new-build --with-hsc2hs=~/.cabal/bin/hsc2hs
  ```

  This will build all dependencies, including `posix-api`, with the
  upstream `hsc2hs` tool.

  ## Infelicities

  This project's objective is to be cross-platform. However, it does not
  accomplish this. The author primarily runs a Debian Linux distribution
  and consequently lacks the resources and the motivation to make this
  work on other platforms. Contributions to improve compatibility are
  welcomed. Current known problems include:

  - On Linux, the library should fallback to using raw sockets if `IPPROTO_ICMP`
    does not work.
  - Support for Windows is missing.
  - Support for BSD is missing. However, adding raw socket support to improve
    the situation on Linux may fix this as well.
  - Support for Darwin is missing. This should not be difficult since
    Darwin supports `IPPROTO_ICMP` sockets.
