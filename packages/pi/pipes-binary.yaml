  # Version 0.4.4

  * Support `transformers >= 0.7.0`.


  # Version 0.4.3

  * Builds with GHC 9.0.1.

  * `Producer'` replaced with `Proxy`. See `pipes`
    issue #224.

  * Use QuickCheck instead of SmallCheck for tests.


  # Version 0.4.2

  * Remove upper bound on dependencies other than base.


  # Version 0.4.1

  * Fix #24 - skip leading empty chunks when decoding.

  * Upper bound dependency bumps (transformers, binary).


  # Version 0.4.0.5

  * Upper bound dependency bumps (tasty).


  # Version 0.4.0.4

  * Upper bound dependency bumps (lens-family-core).


  # Version 0.4.0.3

  * Upper bound dependency bumps (pipes-bytestring).


  # Version 0.4.0.2

  * Upper bound dependency bumps (pipes-bytestring).


  # Version 0.4.0.1

  * Upper bound dependency bumps (tests).


  # Version 0.4.0

  * Generalized `encode` and `encodePut` to `Producer'`s.

  * `decoded` and `decodedL` are now `Lens'`, not `Iso'` anymore.


  # Version 0.3.0.1

  * Add dependency on `ghc-prim`, needed for GHC 7.4.2.


  # Version 0.3.0

  * API revamped in order to support `pipes-parse-3.0.0`.


  # Version 0.2.1

  * Re-export `Put` and `Binary` from the `binary` package.

  * Use `isEndOfBytes` from the `pipes-bytestring` package.


  # Version 0.2.0

  * API revamped in order to support `pipes-4.0.0` and `pipes-parse-2.0.0`.

  * Added functions that act directly upon `Put` and `Get` monads: `encodePut`,
    `decodeGet`, `decodeGetMany`.

  * Decoding functions now report the number of bytes that were consumed in order
    to decode a value.

  * Re-export `Get` and `ByteOffset` from the `binary` package.


  # Version 0.1.0.0

  * Initial version.
