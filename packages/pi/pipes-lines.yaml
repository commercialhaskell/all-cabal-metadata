description: |-
  Deprecated:  This library is deprecated in favor of <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-break pipes-break>,
  which is simpler, better tested, has more utility, has better understood semantics, and includes lens support.

  `pipes-lines` contains utility functions for splitting lines that involve carriage returns aka lines ending in \\r\\n

  These are utility functions that were omitted from pipes-bytestring and pipes-text
