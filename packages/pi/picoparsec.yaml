changelog: |
  0.1

  * Fixed the incorrect tracking of capacity if the initial buffer was
    empty (https://github.com/bos/attoparsec/issues/75)

  0.12.1.1

  * Fixed a data corruption bug that occurred under some circumstances
    if a buffer grew after prompting for more input
    (https://github.com/bos/attoparsec/issues/74)

  0.12.1.0

  * Now compatible with GHC 7.9

  * Reintroduced the Chunk class, used by the parsers package

  0.12.0.0

  * A new internal representation makes almost all real-world parsers
    faster, sometimes by big margins.  For example, parsing JSON data
    with aeson is now up to 70% faster.  These performance improvements
    also come with reduced memory consumption and some new capabilities.

  * The new match combinator gives both the result of a parse and the
    input that it matched.

  * The test suite has doubled in size.  This made it possible to switch
    to the new internal representation with a decent degree of
    confidence that everything was more or less working.

  * The benchmark suite now contains a small family of benchmarks taken
    from real-world uses of attoparsec.

  * A few types that ought to have been private now are.

  * A few obsolete modules and functions have been marked as deprecated.
    They will be removed from the next major release.


  * Initial commit.
