  # CHANGELOG for pinboard-notes-backup

  These version numbers approximately follow the [Haskell Package Versioning Policy (PVP)][PVP]. (I say “approximately” because this package contains no libraries—only an executable—and so it does not actually provide an API per se.)

  [PVP]: https://pvp.haskell.org/

  ## 1.0.7.1 (2025-08-09)

  The program now builds against a wider set of dependencies. There were no changes in functionality.

  ## 1.0.7 (2025-02-11)

  The program should now build with any version of the `tls` library. (In our previous release, 1.0.6, we started requiring a pre-2.0 version of `tls` to avoid [issue #1](https://github.com/bdesham/pinboard-notes-backup/issues/1). This was an unnecessarily brittle solution: newer versions of `tls` work fine as long as we configure them properly.)

  ## 1.0.6 (2025-02-01)

  - If the database contains two notes with the same ID, the program will now abort rather than try to update any of them. (A database constraint should have prevented this situation from ever occurring; this is more of a “belt and braces” change than anything.)
  - The application now builds against a wider range of dependencies.

  ## 1.0.5.7 (2024-01-16)

  The program now builds against a wider set of dependencies. There were no changes in functionality.

  ## 1.0.5.6 (2022-12-02)

  The program now builds against a wider set of dependencies. There were no changes in functionality.

  ## 1.0.5.5 (2022-12-01)

  The program now builds against a wider set of dependencies. There were no changes in functionality.

  ## 1.0.5.4 (2022-02-26)

  The program now builds against a wider set of dependencies. There were no changes in functionality.

  ## 1.0.5.3 (2021-03-24)

  The program now builds against a wider set of dependencies. There were no changes in functionality.

  ## 1.0.5.2 (2021-02-28)

  The program now builds against a wider set of dependencies. There were no changes in functionality.

  ## 1.0.5.1 (2021-02-27)

  The program now builds against a wider set of dependencies. There were no changes in functionality.

  ## 1.0.5 (2019-09-15)

  - The Bash and Zsh completion scripts are now told explicitly that the “FILE” argument should be completed with a filename. (This seems to have been the default behavior for both shells anyway, so this may not represent an actual change in functionality.)
  - The application now builds against a wider range of dependencies.

  ## 1.0.4.1 (2019-07-19)

  - The “built” version of the man page is now included in version control (in the `man` directory) and in the package produced by `cabal sdist`/`stack sdist`. (It was previously necessary to create this yourself by feeding the Markdown source file to Pandoc.)
  - Changed the categories and the description in the cabal file.
  - There were no changes to the code.

  ## 1.0.4 (2019-06-22)

  - Error messages should now be much more comprehensible, especially for the most common network errors.
  - Progress messages now go to standard output, not standard error.
  - The program now has a man page.
  - A few dependency changes mean that the binary should be smaller.

  ## 1.0.3 (2017-11-05)

  The program now builds against a wider set of dependencies. This will allow it to be installed using [Homebrew]. (There were no changes in functionality.)

  [Homebrew]: https://brew.sh

  ## 1.0.2 (2016-12-05)

  If any notes had been changed on the server then the application would error out instead of updating the local copy.

  ## 1.0.1 (2016-07-20)

  Tweaked the help text and made some under-the-hood changes.

  ## 1.0.0 (2016-06-28)

  Initial release.

  # pinboard-notes-backup [![Build](https://github.com/bdesham/pinboard-notes-backup/actions/workflows/main.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bdesham/pinboard-notes-backup/actions/workflows/main.yaml)

  Back up the notes you’ve saved to [Pinboard].

  [Pinboard]: https://pinboard.in

  ## Installation

  ### Homebrew

  If you’re using [Homebrew], you can just run

      brew install pinboard-notes-backup

  [Homebrew]: https://brew.sh

  ### Nix

  If you’re using the [Nix] package manager, run

      nix-env -i -A nixpkgs.pinboard-notes-backup

  If you use NixOS, run

      nix-env -i -A nixos.pinboard-notes-backup

  [Nix]: https://nixos.org/nix/

  ### Manual installation

  Prebuilt binaries are available for macOS and Linux—find them on [the page for the most recent release][release]. To install the program from one of these,

  1. Download the archive for your OS and unpack it.

  2. Copy the `pnbackup` binary to some directory in your `PATH`, like `/usr/local/bin`.

  3. *Optional:* Install the man page by running

         install -D --mode=444 pnbackup.1 /usr/local/share/man/man1

  4. *Optional:* Generate and install a Bash completion script by running

         mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d
         pnbackup --bash-completion-script "$(which pnbackup)" > \
             /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/pnbackup.bash

  5. *Optional:* Generate and install a Zsh completion script by running

         mkdir -p /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions
         pnbackup --zsh-completion-script "$(which pnbackup)" > \
             /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_pnbackup

  [release]: https://github.com/bdesham/pinboard-notes-backup/releases/latest

  ### Building from source

  This is a Haskell program that you can build using [Stack]. With Stack installed, just type

      stack setup

  to download and install GHC (the Haskell compiler) and then

      stack install --local-bin-path=/usr/local/bin

  to build the `pnbackup` binary and install it. You may of course specify a different installation directory if you wish.

  [Stack]: http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/

  You can also build the project with cabal-install, but I’m less familiar with that approach.

  This project [uses GitHub Actions][actions] for automated building. The build is checked on the latest versions of macOS and Ubuntu Linux, with various combinations of Stack, cabal-install, and GHC 8.6 through 9.8.

  [actions]: https://github.com/bdesham/pinboard-notes-backup/actions

  ## Usage

  First you’ll need to grab your Pinboard API token from Pinboard’s [password settings] page. It’s a string like “maciej:abc123456”.

  To save your notes to a file called “Notes.sqlite”, run

      pnbackup -t maciej:abc123456 Notes.sqlite

  replacing the example API token with your own. This will put all of your notes into a SQLite database called “Notes.sqlite”.

  Each time you run the program, it will fetch the list of your notes from the Pinboard server. It will then download any notes that are new or that have been updated on the server, and it will delete any notes that have been deleted from the server. The program does one-way synchronization only: it will update your local database to match what’s on the server but it will never make any changes on the server.

  The [Pinboard API] requires a three-second wait time between each request, and the text of each note must be downloaded in a separate request, so the initial download of your notes may take a while. Subsequent syncs will generally be much shorter, depending on how often you add or modify notes and how often you run pnbackup. If you want to see exactly what `pnbackup` is doing as it works, pass it the `-v` or `--verbose` flags.

  [password settings]: https://pinboard.in/settings/password
  [Pinboard API]: https://pinboard.in/api/

  ## Data format

  Your notes are stored in a table called “notes” with the following schema:

  ``` sql
  CREATE TABLE notes (
      id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
      title TEXT NOT NULL,
      text TEXT NOT NULL,
      hash TEXT NOT NULL,
      created DATETIME NOT NULL,
      updated DATETIME NOT NULL
  );
  ```

  These columns correspond exactly to the fields listed on the [Pinboard API] page.

  Why SQLite and not some plain-text format? In [the words of Paul Ford][Ford],

  > SQLite is incredibly well-documented. It’s also instantly usable as a database from the command line with no pre-processing at all, even for very large files, and there are immediately usable SQLite APIs for every programming language. Plus it’s incredibly easy to turn SQLite data into plain text, it has freely available extensions for geo, full-text, and hierarchical data, and it’s tiny and public-domain.

  [Ford]: https://trackchanges.postlight.com/usable-data-5d626d8a6b57

  If you've used this application to back up your notes to a file called Notes.sqlite, you could use this quick and dirty Python script to print them in JSON format:

  ``` python
  #!/usr/bin/env python3

  from json import dumps
  import sqlite3

  conn = sqlite3.connect("Notes.sqlite")
  conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row
  curs = conn.cursor()
  curs.execute("SELECT * FROM notes")
  print(dumps([dict(r) for r in curs.fetchall()]))
  ```
