  # Version 0.4

  *: COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE: We now depend on
    `network-simple-0.4`, which introduced some breaking changes. In
    `pipes-network-tls`, we merely replaced uses of `ClientSettings` and
    `ServerSettings` for `ClientParams` and `ServerParams`.  Please refer
    to its [changelog](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/network-simple-0.4/changelog).


  # Version 0.3

  * BREAKING CHANGE: We now depend on `network-simple-0.3`, which introduced some
    breaking changes. Please refer to its
    [changelog](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/network-simple-0.3/changelog).

  * Remove `Pipes.Safe.Base m ~ IO` constraints.

  * Remove upper-bound constraints on all dependencies other than `base`.


  # Version 0.2.1

  * Dependency bumps.


  # Version 0.2.0

  * Significantly upgraded the API and renamed functions to play well with
    pipes-4.0, pipes-safe-2.0, pipes-network-0.6 and
    network-simple-tls-0.2.

  * Throw `IOError` in `IO` in order to report timeout errors. Delete
    the `Timeout` data-type.


  # Version 0.1.1.0

  * Re-export `Network.Socket.withSocketsDo`


  # Version 0.1.0.0

  * First release.
