  # Changelog for `mlkem`

  ## 0.1.1.0 - 2025-11-30

  * Fixed encoding and decoding on big-endian architectures

  * Fall back to bytes when the architecture does not support unaligned memory
    access

  ## 0.1.0.0 - 2025-11-02

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  _Module-Lattice-based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism_ implemented in Haskell.

  See [FIPS 203](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final).

  Example session:

  ```haskell
  > import Crypto.PubKey.ML_KEM
  > import Data.Proxy
  > let params = Proxy :: Proxy ML_KEM_768
  > (encapKey, decapKey) <- generate params
  > (sharedKey, ciphertext) <- encapsulate encapKey
  > let sharedKey' = decapsulate decapKey ciphertext
  > sharedKey == sharedKey'
  True
  ```

  ## Notes

  The library does its best to destroy secrets and intermediate buffers from
  memory after use, despite the implementation in functional style.  This relies
  on finalization by the garbage collector and is not guaranteed to run before
  the program exits.  Also, depending on optimizations applied, lambdas may
  capture variables and move them to the heap.  This could theoretically include
  machine words containing secret information that would not then be destroyed.

  Best performance is obtained with the LLVM code generator.  On ARM, define
  macro `__ARM_FEATURE_UNALIGNED` if unaligned access is supported by the target.

  ## Testing

  The test suite executes all NIST test vectors but necessary files are not
  included in the package to limit its size.  Instead, two files are downloaded
  from the project repository during execution, and this relies on commands `sh`
  and `curl` to run the script `tests/get-vectors.sh`.  If not applicable to your
  environment, please execute the same steps manually.  It will be needed only
  the first time.
