description: |
  Tool to produce dependency diagram from the set of *.hs files. Diagram
  will include specified top-level declaration and all user-defined
  types referencd from there (recursively).

  To see dependency diagram for type MegaData and all other types
  referenced from there, use:

          graphtype MegaData *.hs

  User can choose to omit types and newtypes that do not contain
  anything other than library types - this could be useful to unclutter
  really large diagrams. Try running "graphtype --trim ..." and see
  whether it helps you or otherwise.
