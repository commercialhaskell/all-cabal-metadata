  [![build status][BuildShield]][BuildLink] [![hackage version][HackageShield]][HackageLink]


  GraphWiz provides a small monadic DSL to generate DOT files. It aims at being intuitive to use, by replicating in your code the structure of the resulting DOT file.

  It's a "wizard" for Graphviz's DOT format, hence the name "GraphWiz".

  ## Overview

  ### Graph creation

  This library exports a simple monad: `Dot` (and its transformer version `DotT`), that you can only run with a function that indicates how the graph should be rendered: `graph`, `digraph`, `strictGraph`, `strictDigraph`. Within this monad, you can create graph elements with `node`, `edge` (or `-->`), `subgraph`, `cluster`, and their variants.

  All such functions that create an element return an `Entity`, an ID that uniquely identifies that element within the graph. Additionally, the ID of the latest created entity (regardless of its type) can be accessed with `itsID`.

  ```haskell
  digraph do
    a <- node "a"
    b <- node "b"
    a --> b
    subgraph do
      c <- node "c"
      a --> c
      b --> c
  ```

  ### Attributes

  You can set default attributes for an entity type with `defaults`. You can access the attributes of a specific entity with `attributes`, and the latest created entity's attributes are accessible with `its`. All of those give you lenses to values within the underlying state; you can manipulate them with the `=` [lens operators](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-5.3.3/docs/Control-Lens-Setter.html#g:5).

  Attributes are represented as a simple mapping from `Text` to `Text`, to avoid being too restrictive. There is, however, one lens per attribute listed in the [Graphviz documentation](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html), allowing you to avoid strings in attributes declarations.

  ```haskell
  graphT do
    defaults Edge .= [("style", "dotted"), ("color", "blue")]
    defaults Node . shape ?= "hexagon"
    x <- node "x"
    its fontcolor ?= "red"
    liftIO $ print =<< use (attributes x)
  ```

  ### TextBuilder

  For efficiency and convenience, the result of running the `Dot` monad is not a `String` or `Text`; it's a [TextBuilder](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-builder-1.0.0.4/docs/TextBuilder.html), that can be converted to a strict `Text` or even printed directly to the standard output.

  ### Auto compound

  The DOT syntax to draw edges between clusters is quite cumbersome. We have to declare the graph to be `compound`, and we have to create the edge between two nodes within the clusters, with specific attributes.

  ```dot
  graph foo {
    compound = true;
    subgraph cluster_a { a }
    subgraph cluster_b { b }
    a -- b [ltail="cluster_a", lhead="cluster_b"]
  }
  ```

  GraphWiz automates the task: if one end of an edge is a cluster, the `compound` attribute is added to the graph, and the correct attributes are set at rendering time. To be as unobtrusive as possible, the values of `ltail` and `lhead` will not be updated if already present, trusting the user to know best.

  ```haskell
  graph do
    (cluster_a, _) <- cluster $ node "a"
    (cluster_b, _) <- cluster $ node "b"
    cluster_a --> cluster_b
  ```

  ## Full example

  From the [example](example) folder:

  ##### Haskell source
  ```haskell
  main =
    TB.putLnToStdOut $
      digraph do
        defaults Node . style ?= "filled"

        ast <- cluster_ do
          its label ?= "front end"

          source <- node "source code"
          its fillcolor ?= "#c3ffd8"

          ast <- node "AST"
          its fillcolor ?= "yellow"

          source --> ast
          its label ?= "parsing"

          pure ast

        cluster do
          its label ?= "middle end"

          ir <- node "IR"
          its shape     ?= "diamond"
          its fillcolor ?= "salmon"

          ast --> ir
          its label ?= "lowering"
          its style ?= "dotted"
  ```

  #### Resulting DOT file

  ```DOT
  digraph {
    subgraph cluster0 {
      label="front end";
      node1 [label="source code",style="filled",fillcolor="#c3ffd8"]
      node2 [label="AST",style="filled",fillcolor="yellow"]
      node1 -> node2 [label="parsing"]
    }
    subgraph cluster4 {
      label="middle end";
      node5 [label="IR",style="filled",fillcolor="salmon",shape="diamond"]
      node2 -> node5 [label="lowering",style="dotted"]
    }
  }
  ```
