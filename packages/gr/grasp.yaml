  = Brief summary
  This is part of the final project for the AMMM (MIRI, FIB-UPC) subject.
  It contains the random instance generator plus all the GRASP part.

  It is hosted at https://bitbucket.org/janmasrovira/am3-project.

  This package includes:

  * A polymorphic GRASP implementation.
  * A random instance generator for the AM3 project.
  * The @AM3@ folder contains the code specific to the final project for
  the Algorithmic Methods for Mathematical Models subject
  (Master in Innovation and Research in Informatics, FIB-UPC).

  = Contents
  Make sure to read the documentation of all the modules listed below.

  Specifically, the contents of each module (sorted by relevance to the project) are:

  1. "GRASP": A polymorphic parameterizable implementation of a Greedy Randomized
  Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP).
  The idea is taken from this paper: http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_FILE/2001/09/371.pdf.
  It does not contain anything that is specific to the AM3 project.
  2. "AM3.Solution": Contains all the specific functions to the solution of an
  instance of the AM3 project.
  3. "AM3.RandomInstance": A parameterizable random generator of instances.
  4. "AM3.Instance": An instance of the problem. It also provides useful functions that
  have to do with constructing, querying, importing, exporting... an instance.
