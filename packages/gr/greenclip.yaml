  greenclip and don't waste your time anymore\nto reselect things other and other.\n\n**Purpose:**\nKeeps
  track of your history of selections to quickly switch between them\n\n**Demo:**
  \ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utk-9Gy8H3w\">Video Link</a>\n<br/>\n<a
  href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IycORAdW9M\">Video made by @gotbletu</a>\n\n**Features:**\n
  \ + Integrated with [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi)\n  + Permanently
  set some selections to added at the end (set `staticHistoryPath = your/file/with/static/entries`
  in the config file)\n  + Merge X Primary selection with clipboard selection (set
  `usePrimarySelectionAsInput = True` in the config file)\n  + Blacklist some applications
  (see `I want to blacklist some applications !` in the FAQ section)\n  + Copy small
  images\n\n## Installation\n\n1. It's a static binary so drop it anywhere in your
  $PATH env\n\n```wget https://github.com/erebe/greenclip/releases/download/3.0/greenclip```\n\nAlternatively
  if you are using Archlinux you can install the package from AUR\n\n``pacman -S rofi-greenclip``\n\nPS:
  If you want, you can add a permanent list of selections to be added to your current
  history. Go see the config file\n\n\n## Usage\n\nGreenclip is intended to be used
  with [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi)\n\n1. Spawn the daemon ``` greenclip
  daemon ```\n2. When ever you need to get your selections history ``` rofi -modi
  \"clipboard:greenclip print\" -show clipboard -run-command '{cmd}' ```\n3. The entry
  that you have selected will be in your clipboard now\n4. Configuration file can
  be found in ```.config/greenclip.cfg```\n\n## Migrating from 2.x version to 3.x
  one\n\n1. Kill all greenclip process already running\n2. Delete your old config
  file and old cache file (in ~/.cache/greenclip*)\n3. Start the new version of greenclip\n\n##
  Building the project\n\n1. Get [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
  for Haskell\n2. stack init && stack install\n\nor you can look at the .travis.yml
  file\n\n## FAQ\n\nQ. Greenclip does not copy selection !\n\nA. Greenclip cannot
  run alongside other clipboard manager. If you have already one activated (there
  is one by default in KDE), you have first to disable it before trying to run greenclip\n\n---------\n\nQ.
  I cannot paste images !\n\nA. You can only keep in your history small images  (~
  <500 kb). I disabled the support for bigger images as it will turn your CPU into
  a heater for winter.\n\n----------\n\nQ. I want to blacklist some applications !\n\nA.
  There is in your config file a section for blacklisting applications.\n   You can
  run greenclip daemon in a terminal to find what is the name of the application who
  has the current selection.\n   Be aware that a lot of application does not name
  their clipboard process/window, so it will be empty most of the time.\n   Be aware
  also, that if you use an electron application (like slack i.e) you will get a generic
  name like \"Chromium clipboard\"\n   \n----------\n\nQ. I want to paste selection
  directly after selecting them !\n\nA. This is not possible as when you invoke rofi,
  you lose focus of your current window and there is no way to find it back (from
  greenclip point of view)\n   Nonetheless, you can emulate the feature with xdotool
  `rofi -modi \"clipboard:greenclip print\" -show clipboard -run-command '{cmd}' ;
  sleep 0.5; xdotool type (xclip -o -selection clipboard)`\n\n----------\n\nQ. I want
  to thank you for greenclip !\n\nA. Give a star to this repository\n"
