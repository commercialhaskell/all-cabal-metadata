  # grouped-list

  Welcome to the `grouped-list` repository.

  We are at an early stage of development, but
  contributions are more than welcome. If you
  are interested, feel free to submit a pull
  request.

  # What is this about?

  This library defines the type of grouped lists,
  ``Grouped``. Values of this type are lists
  with a finite number of elements. The only
  special feature is that consecutive elements
  that are equal on the list are internally
  represented as a single element annotated
  with the number of repetitions. Therefore,
  operations on lists that have many consecutive
  repetitions perform much better, and memory
  usage is reduced. However, this type is suboptimal
  for lists that do not have many consecutive
  repetitions. We are trying to ameliorate this.
