  Grammatical Parsers
  ===================

  Behold, yet another parser combinator library in Haskell. Except this one is capable of working with grammars rather than mere parsers. A more in-depth description is available in the [paper](../Grampa.lhs.pdf) from Haskell Symposium 2017, what follows is a short tutorial.

  You can apply the usual
  [Applicative](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Control-Applicative.html#t:Applicative),
  [Alternative](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Control-Applicative.html#t:Alternative), and
  [Monad](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Control-Monad.html#t:Monad) operators to combine primitive parsers
  into larger ones. The combinators from the [parsers](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsers) library type classes
  are also available. Here are some typical imports you may need:

  ~~~ {.haskell}
  {-# LANGUAGE RecordWildCards, ScopedTypeVariables, TemplateHaskell #-}
  module README where
  import Control.Applicative
  import Data.Char (isDigit)
  import Data.Functor.Classes (Show1, showsPrec1)
  import Text.Grampa
  import Text.Grampa.ContextFree.Memoizing.LeftRecursive (Parser)
  import qualified Rank2
  import qualified Rank2.TH
  ~~~

  What puts this library apart from most is that these parsers are *grammatical*, just as the library name says. Instead
  of writing the parser definitions as top-level bindings, you can and should group them into a grammar record definition,
  like this:

  ~~~ {.haskell}
  arithmetic :: Rank2.Apply g => GrammarBuilder Arithmetic g Parser String
  arithmetic Arithmetic{..} = Arithmetic{
     sum= product
           <|> string "-" *> (negate <$> product)
           <|> (+) <$> sum <* string "+" <*> product
           <|> (-) <$> sum <* string "-" <*> product,
     product= factor
           <|> (*) <$> product <* string "*" <*> factor
           <|> div <$> product <* string "/" <*> factor,
     factor= read <$> number
             <|> string "(" *> sum <* string ")",
     number= takeCharsWhile1 isDigit <?> "number"}
  ~~~

  What on Earth for? One good reason is that these parser definitions can then be left-recursive, which is normally a
  death knell for parser libraries. There are other benefits like memoization and grammar composability, and the main
  downside is the obligation to declare the grammar record:

  ~~~ {.haskell}
  data Arithmetic f = Arithmetic{sum     :: f Int,
                                 product :: f Int,
                                 factor  :: f Int,
                                 number  :: f String}
  ~~~

  and to make it an instance of several rank 2 type classes:

  ~~~ {.haskell}
  $(Rank2.TH.deriveAll ''Arithmetic)
  ~~~

  Optionally, you may also be inclined to declare a proper ``Show`` instance, as it's often handy:

  ~~~ {.haskell}
  instance Show1 f => Show (Arithmetic f) where
     show Arithmetic{..} =
        "Arithmetic{\n  sum=" ++ showsPrec1 0 sum
             (",\n  product=" ++ showsPrec1 0 factor
             (",\n  factor=" ++ showsPrec1 0 factor
             (",\n  number=" ++ showsPrec1 0 number "}")))
  ~~~

  Once that's done, use [fixGrammar](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/grammatical-parsers/docs/Text-Grampa.html#v:fixGrammar) to, well, fix the grammar

  ~~~ {.haskell}
  grammar = fixGrammar arithmetic
  ~~~

  and then [parseComplete](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/grammatical-parsers/docs/Text-Grampa.html#v:parseComplete)
  or [parsePrefix](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/grammatical-parsers/docs/Text-Grampa.html#v:parsePrefix) to parse
  some input.

  ~~~ {.haskell}
  -- |
  -- >>> parseComplete grammar "42"
  -- Arithmetic{
  --   sum=Compose (Right [42]),
  --   product=Compose (Right [42]),
  --   factor=Compose (Right [42]),
  --   number=Compose (Right ["42"])}
  -- >>> parseComplete grammar "1+2*3"
  -- Arithmetic{
  --   sum=Compose (Right [7]),
  --   product=Compose (Left (ParseFailure {failurePosition = Down 4, expectedAlternatives = FailureDescription {staticDescriptions = ["end of input"], literalDescriptions = []}, errorAlternatives = []})),
  --   factor=Compose (Left (ParseFailure {failurePosition = Down 4, expectedAlternatives = FailureDescription {staticDescriptions = ["end of input"], literalDescriptions = []}, errorAlternatives = []})),
  --   number=Compose (Left (ParseFailure {failurePosition = Down 4, expectedAlternatives = FailureDescription {staticDescriptions = ["end of input"], literalDescriptions = []}, errorAlternatives = []}))}
  -- >>> parsePrefix grammar "1+2*3 apples"
  -- Arithmetic{
  --   sum=Compose (Compose (Right [("+2*3 apples",1),("*3 apples",3),(" apples",7)])),
  --   product=Compose (Compose (Right [("+2*3 apples",1)])),
  --   factor=Compose (Compose (Right [("+2*3 apples",1)])),
  --   number=Compose (Compose (Right [("+2*3 apples","1")]))}
  ~~~

  To see more grammar examples, go straight to the
  [examples](https://github.com/blamario/grampa/tree/master/grammatical-parsers/examples) directory that builds up several
  smaller grammars and combines them all together in the
  [Combined](https://github.com/blamario/grampa/blob/master/grammatical-parsers/examples/Combined.hs) module.

  For more conventional tastes there are monolithic examples of
  [Lua](https://github.com/blamario/language-lua2/blob/master/src/Language/Lua/Grammar.hs) and [Oberon](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/language-oberon) grammars as well.
