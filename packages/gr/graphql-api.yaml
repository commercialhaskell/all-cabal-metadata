  =====================
  graphql-api changelog
  =====================

  0.4.0 (2019-10-15)
  ==================

  * Schemas that have empty field lists or empty unions will fail much earlier
  * [breaking change] allow user-supplied handlers to emit errors (#224)
  * Better compile-time error reporting

  0.3.0 (2018-02-08)
  ==================

  Breaking changes
  ----------------

  * ``Enum`` handlers are now monadic (see `#118`_)
  * You must use protolude 0.2.1 or later
  * ``Defaultable`` must now be imported from ``GraphQL.API``, rather than ``GraphQL.Resolver``,
    this moves ``GraphQL.API`` closer to being sufficient for API definition. (see `#149`_)
  * ``GraphQL.Value.ToValue`` and ``GraphQL.Value.FromValue`` modules have been removed.
    Import ``ToValue(..)`` and ``FromValue(..)`` from ``GraphQL.Value`` directly.

  Improvements
  ------------

  * Now support GHC 8.2 as well as 8.0.2 and later
  * Added support for anonymous queries (thanks `@sunwukonga`_)

  .. _`#149`: https://github.com/haskell-graphql/graphql-api/issues/149
  .. _`@sunwukonga`: https://github.com/sunwukonga

  v0.2.0 (2017-10-12)
  ===================

  * Make ``Name`` an overloaded string that panics if an invalid name is
    provided.
  * Correctly descend into the type parameter of a ``Maybe``. See https://github.com/jml/graphql-api/issues/119.
    This is a backwards-incompatible change.

    A common update would be having to ``fmap pure callback`` instead of just ``callback``
    for ``Maybe`` handlers.


  v0.1.0 (2017-01-30)
  ===================

  No code changes.

  * Remove ``-Werror`` in order to upload to hackage


  v0.1.0 (2017-01-29)
  ===================

  Initial release, support basic handling of GraphQL queries.
