  == The Grab type

  A grab consumes some portion (none, part, or all) of
  its input @bag@, and returns a @residue@ consisting of
  the unconsumed input, some monoidal @log@ (e.g. a list
  of error messages), and some @desideratum@ (the object
  of desire) produced from the consumed input, or
  @Nothing@ if the grab failed.

  > newtype Grab bag residue log desideratum =
  >   Grab (
  >     bag -> (residue, log, Maybe desideratum)
  >   )

  Grabs are useful as parsers for inputs such as JSON
  objects or lists of form parameters, where the input data
  is not necessarily given linearly in the same order in
  which we want to consume it.

  == Applicative composition

  A @Simple@ grab (where the @bag@ and @residue@ are the
  same type) has an @Applicative@ instance.

  > instance (bag ~ residue, Monoid log) =>
  >     Applicative (Grab bag residue log)

  For example, we can create two simple list grabs, one that
  grabs multiples of two, and the other that grabs multiples
  of three:

  > twos, threes :: Monoid log =>
  >     Control.Grab.Simple [Integer] log [Integer]
  > twos   = partition (Data.List.partition (\x -> mod x 2 == 0))
  > threes = partition (Data.List.partition (\x -> mod x 3 == 0))

  > λ> runGrabMaybe ((,) <$> twos @() <*> threes @()) [1..10]
  > Just ([2,4,6,8,10],[3,9])

  Notice that the second part of the resulting tuple contains only
  the /odd/ multiples of three. Because @twos@ runs first, it
  consumes @6@ before the @threes@ can get it.

  == Pipeline composition

  @a / b@ is a pipeline of two grabs, where the desideratum from
  @a@ is the @bag@ for @b@.
  .
  > (/) :: Semigroup log
  >     => Grab bag residue log x
  >     -> Grab x  _residue log desideratum
  >     -> Grab bag residue log desideratum

  > λ> runGrabMaybe (twos @() / threes @()) [1..10]
  > Just [6]

  > λ> runGrabMaybe ((,) <$> (twos @() / threes @()) <*> threes @()) [1..10]
  > Just ([6],[3,9])
