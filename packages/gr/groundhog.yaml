changelog: |
  0.12
  * Suppport for GHC 9
  * Drop support for GHC 8.0
  * Refactor test suite and migrate it to HSpec

  0.11
  * Suppport for GHC 8.8
  * Drop support for GHC 7.*

  0.10
  * Pass type information along the UntypedExpr
  * Fix #57 (table indexes are ignored)

  0.9.0
  * Support for GHC 8.4

  0.8.0.1
  * New typeclass to allow transaction rollback through ExceptT

  0.8
  * Simplified signatures for PurePersistField and PrimitivePersistField
  * Basic support for streaming API
  * Support for GHC 8

  0.7.0.3
  * Add attoparsec dependency

  0.7.0.2
  * Bump blaze-builder dependency

  0.7.0.1
  * Support for monad-control 1.0

  0.7.0
  * Removed logger argument from executeMigration and runMigration
  * PersistField instance for lazy ByteString

  0.6.0
  * Entities without keys. It can be useful for many-to-many tables which hold keys but are not referenced
  * Entity and fields descriptions are parameterized so that they can be promoted
  * Entity and fields descriptions are dependent on database proxy. It allows to use different types depending on a database, for example, the same type can be array[] in PostgreSQL and varchar elsewhere
  * Migration support for indexes on expressions

  0.5.1
  * DISTINCT select option
  * Support entities with no fields
  * Added getCurrentSchema function into SchemaAnalyzer

  0.5.0
  * Reimplemented projections with constraint kinds
  * Moved QueryRaw constraint into class SqlDb simplifying SQL function signatures
  * Compatibility with GHC 7.8

  0.4.2.2
  * Create missing schemas (or databases in MySQL terminology) during migration
  * Replaced datatype Proxy with type variable

  0.4.2
  * Cond can be used as expression
  * Expressions instances for Fractional, Floating, Integral
  * Operator case_

  0.4.1
  * Added functions replaceBy and deleteAll
  * Renamed deleteByKey to deleteBy
  * Instances of UTCTime and ZonedTime can read both values with time zone and without it

  0.4.0.3
  * Added function runDbConnNoTransaction to run a monadic action without creating a transaction around it

  0.4.0.2
  * Fix for nullable fields in unique constraint

  0.4.0.1
  * Added migration helper function Database.Groundhog.Generic.getQueries
  * Added comparison function Database.Groundhog.Expression.isFieldNothing

  0.4.0
  * References to tables not mapped by groundhog
  * Default column values
  * Better type inference for expressions
  * Constructor for empty condition CondEmpty
  * Logging queries based on monad-logger

  0.3.1
  * Removed superclass constraints SinglePersistField and PurePersistField for PrimitivePersistField
  * Fixed prefixing columns of nested embedded datatypes when not all names are specified

  0.3
  * Custom compositional functions and operators
  * ConnectionManager which helps to extract connections from pools, application state, etc.
  * Support for savepoints
  * Schema qualified tables
  * Added unique constraints of type PRIMARY
  * Reference clauses ON DELETE and ON UPDATE.
  * Exposed database introspection capabilities with class SchemaAnalyzer

  0.2
  * Database indexes
  * Support DB-specific column types
  * Renaming and refactoring

  0.1.0.2
  * Removed overly restrictive upper bound for bytestring package

  0.1.0.1
  * Compatibility with GHC 7.6

  0.1.0
  The library was almost completely overhauled.
  * Support for embedded datatypes
  * New syntax for select
  * Embedded datatypes
  * Composite foreign keys and natural keys
  * Projections of datatype fields
  * Codegeneration modules are moved to groundhog-th package

  0.0.1
  The first release. It has support for polymorphic datatypes and sum types.
changelog-type: text
description: This library maps your datatypes to a relational model, in a way similar
  to what ORM libraries do in object-oriented programming. The mapping can be configured
  to work with almost any schema. Groundhog supports schema migrations, composite
  keys, advanced expressions in queries, and much more. See tutorial <https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/user/lykahb/groundhog>
  and examples <https://github.com/lykahb/groundhog/tree/master/examples> on GitHub.
