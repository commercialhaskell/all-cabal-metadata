  Mandelbrot Set fractal explorer using the ruff library.

  Requires GTK, OpenGL, and GLSL fragment shader support; lots of RAM
  and multiple CPU cores recommended.

  If you want to explore very deep zooms, you'll need hmpfr which
  currently requires GHC to be compiled with integer-simple instead of
  the default integer-gmp.  To install with MPFR support, use
  @cabal install gruff -fmpfr@.
  Note that the default setting for this flag has changed since gruff-0.2.

  gruff-0.4 updates for ghc-8.0.

  gruff-0.3.4 updates dependencies for ghc-7.8.  Colouring is improved.

  gruff-0.3.3 relaxes dependencies for ghc-7.6.

  gruff-0.3.1 is a bugfix release, fixing a performance problem wherein
  offscreen tiles were needlessly calculated.  The performance gain
  is much less (and in many cases is in fact a performance loss) when
  using integer-simple.

  gruff-0.3 includes a small library to allow external programs to
  create diagrams and animations with gruff.  See the gruff-examples
  package.  The interface has been remodelled to simplify it and add
  informative feature overlays.

  gruff-0.2.1 was a bugfix release.  Changes since gruff-0.2:

  * Supersampling bugs are fixed (no more undocumented quantization
  leading to inconsistent appearance at different zoom levels).

  * Race condition bugs in cache management are fixed (no more
  incompletely rendered images).

  * Internal changes/refactoring to make future additions easier.

  Features in this version include:

  * Interactive fractal browser display with mouse controls:

  * Left click to zoom in (press shift for bigger jumps).

  * Right click to zoom out (press shift for bigger jumps).

  * Middle click to center.

  * Shift middle click to auto-focus.

  * Control left click to label with period.

  * Control right click to label with angled internal address (slow!).

  * Session persistance (stored in @~\/.gruff\/state.gruff@ - states can
  also be loaded from and saved to other files, including labels and
  rays).  Note that the file format is incompatible with previous
  releases of gruff.

  * Tile cache (by default in @~\/.gruff\/cache@ - symlink it somewhere
  with a few GB of space if you plan on exploring a lot).

  * Can use MPFR if desired for higher precision, allowing deeper
  zooms and locating high period nucleii.

  * Limited amount of customizable colouring (colours for interior,
  border, and exterior points, as well as labels and rays).

  * Supersampling for more detailed images (useful range is 1 to 16).

  * Rudimentary scripting support (see the gruff-examples package).

  Future versions will focus on enhancing the scripting support.
