description: This is a general purpose Haskell GraphQL query parser and interpreter.
  It is including data processing to return GraphQL object formats. The query parser
  and interpreter are universal (on available query types). It is accepting any string
  query, and it is returning a list of string database-queries. The data processing
  unit is designed around the return values from the Yesod and Persistent interface
  (cast as Text data values from PersistValue). With another server that is same data
  representation on the returned values from the database, this entire package is
  applicable.
