  # Revision history for graphql-w-persistent

  ## 0.9.0.0 -- 2020-06-01

  * Null values are now supported; table are now supported to appear more than once in joins; data types are simplified for .json file support; alternative json aggregate SQL query functions are now supported for faster queries; error is fixed from version 0.8.0.0 for more than two nested objects; inline fragments were not working in version 0.8.0.0, but it is now working; and removed a requirement for "Unexpected nulls" for null values which is making easy compliance with other databases packages and types.

description: This is an application of GraphQL to querying SQL databases. The package
  functions are to interpret GraphQL string queries, to make SQL queries, and to process
  list-style database-returned values into a GraphQL string output (which you may
  use with another program). The data processing functions are designed for the Persistent
  library return values, but any (Eq a) => [[a]] returned type is valid input to this
  library if translations (and a check for null value) are provided for data types
  (Text, Int64, Double, and Boolean). Prospect packages are the odbc package (with
  the query function) and HDBC package (with the quickQuery function). You may find
  another to suit your stack. Examples and applications are available at the homepage
  (GitHub). I would like a star while you are there.
