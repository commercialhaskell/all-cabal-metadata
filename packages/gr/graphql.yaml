  # Change Log
  All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

  ## [0.4.0.0] - 2019-07-23
  ### Added
  - Support for mutations.
  - Error handling (with monad transformers).
  - Nullable types.
  - Arbitrary nested lists support.
  - Potential BOM header parsing.

  ### Changed
  - attoparsec is replaced with megaparsec.
  - The library is now under `Language.GraphQL` (instead of `Data.GraphQL`).
  - HUnit and tasty are replaced with Hspec.
  - `Alternative`/`MonadPlus` resolver constraints are replaced with `MonadIO`.

  ### Removed
  - Duplicates from `Language.GraphQL.AST` already available in
    `Language.GraphQL.AST.Core`.
  - All module exports are now explicit, so private and help functions aren't
    exported anymore.

  ## [0.3] - 2015-09-22
  ### Changed
  - Exact match numeric types to spec.
  - Names follow now the spec.
  - AST slightly different for better readability or easier parsing.
  - Replace golden test for test to validate parsing/encoding.

  ### Added
  - Parsing errors in all cases where `Alternative` is used.
  - GraphQL encoder.

  ### Fixed
  - Expect braces `inputValueDefinitions` instead of parens when parsing.

  ## [0.2.1] - 2015-09-16
  ### Fixed
  - Include data files for golden tests in Cabal package.
  - Support for ghc-7.8.

  ## [0.2] - 2015-09-14
  ### Added
  - Rudimentary parser for `GraphQL` which successfully parses the sample file
    `kitchen-sink.graphql` from `graphql-js` tests.
  - Golden test for `kitchen-sink.grahql` parsing.
  ### Changed
  - Many optional data types in `GraphQl` didn't need to be wrapped in a `Maybe`.
  - Some `newtype`s became type synonyms for easier parsing.

  ## 0.1 - 2015-09-12
  ### Added
  - Data types for the GraphQL language.

  # Haskell GraphQL

  [![Hackage Version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/graphql.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/graphql)
  [![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/belka-ew/graphql/branches/master/badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/belka-ew/graphql)
  [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSD--3--Clause-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caraus-ecms/graphql/master/LICENSE)

  For now this only provides a parser for the GraphQL query language and allows
  to execute queries and mutations without the schema validation step.
  But the idea is to be a Haskell port of
  [`graphql-js`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js). Next releases should
  include:

  - [x] GraphQL AST
  - [x] Parser for the GraphQL language.
  - [x] Printer for GraphQL. This is not pretty yet.
  - [ ] GraphQL Schema AST.
  - [ ] Parser for the GraphQL Schema language.
  - [ ] Printer for the GraphQL Schema language.
  - [ ] Interpreter of GraphQL requests.
  - [ ] Utilities to define GraphQL types and schema.
