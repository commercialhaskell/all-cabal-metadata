synopsis: Haskell GraphQL implementation
changelog: "# Changelog\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in
  this file.\n\nThe format is based on\n[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),\nand
  this project adheres to\n[Haskell Package Versioning Policy](https://pvp.haskell.org/).\n\n##
  [0.11.1.0] - 2021-02-07\n### Added\n- `Validate.Rules`:\n  - `overlappingFieldsCanBeMergedRule`\n
  \ - `possibleFragmentSpreadsRule`\n  - `variablesInAllowedPositionRule`\n  - `valuesOfCorrectTypeRule`\n-
  `Type.Schema.implementations` contains a map from interfaces and objects to\n  interfaces
  they implement.\n- Show instances for GraphQL type definitions in the `Type` modules.\n-
  Custom Show instances for type and value representations in the AST.\n- `AST.Document.escape`
  escapes a single character in a `StringValue`.\n\n## [0.11.0.0] - 2020-11-07\n###
  Changed\n- `AST.Document.Selection` wraps additional new types: `Field`, `FragmentSpread`\n
  \ and  `InlineFragment`. Thus validation rules can be defined more concise.\n- `AST.Document`:
  `Argument` and `Directive` contain token location.\n- `AST.Document.Argument` contains
  the `Value` wrapped in the `Node`.\n- `AST.Lexer.colon` and `AST.Lexer.at` ignore
  the result (it is always the\n- same).\n- `Validate.Validation`: `Validation.rules`
  was removed. `Validation.rules`\n  contained the list of rules, but the executed
  rules shouldn't know about other\n  rules. `rules` was a part of the `Validation`
  context to pass it easier\n  around, but since the rules are traversed once now
  and applied to all nodes in\n  the tree at the beginning, it isn't required anymore.\n-
  `Validate.Validation.Error`: `path` is removed since it isn't possible to get\n
  \ the path without executing the query.\n- `Error.Error`: `path` added. It is currently
  always empty.\n- `Validate.Validation.Path` was moved to `Error`.\n- `Type.Schema.Schema`:
  data constructor is hidden, fields are accessible with\n  freestanding functions:
  `query`, `mutation`, `subscription`, `directives` and\n  `types`.\n\n### Added\n-
  `Validate.Validation.Rule` constructors:\n  - `SelectionRule`\n  - `FragmentRule`\n
  \ - `FragmentSpreadRule`\n  - `ArgumentsRule`\n  - `DirectivesRule`\n  - `VariablesRule`\n
  \ - `FieldRule`\n- `Validate.Rules`:\n  - `fragmentsOnCompositeTypesRule`\n  - `fragmentSpreadTargetDefinedRule`\n
  \ - `fragmentSpreadTypeExistenceRule`\n  - `noUnusedFragmentsRule`\n  - `noFragmentCyclesRule`\n
  \ - `uniqueArgumentNamesRule`\n  - `uniqueDirectiveNamesRule`\n  - `uniqueVariableNamesRule`\n
  \ - `variablesAreInputTypesRule`\n  - `noUndefinedVariablesRule`\n  - `noUndefinedVariablesRule`\n
  \ - `noUnusedVariablesRule`\n  - `uniqueInputFieldNamesRule`\n  - `fieldsOnCorrectTypeRule`\n
  \ - `scalarLeafsRule`\n  - `knownArgumentNamesRule`\n  - `knownDirectiveNamesRule`\n
  \ - `directivesInValidLocationsRule`\n  - `providedRequiredArgumentsRule`\n  - `providedRequiredInputFieldsRule`\n-
  `AST.Document.Field`.\n- `AST.Document.FragmentSpread`.\n- `AST.Document.InlineFragment`.\n-
  `AST.Document.Node`.\n- `Type.In.Arguments`: Type alias for an argument map.\n-
  `Type.Schema.Directive` and `Type.Schema.Directives` are directive definition\n
  \ representation.\n- `Type.Schema.schema`: Schema constructor.\n\n### Fixed\n- Collecting
  existing types from the schema considers subscriptions.\n\n### Removed\n- `AST.Document.Alias`.
  Use `AST.Document.Name` instead.\n\n## [0.10.0.0] - 2020-08-29\n### Changed\n- `Test.Hspec.GraphQL.*`:
  replace `IO` in the resolver with any `MonadCatch`.\n- The `Location` argument of
  `AST.Document.Definition.ExecutableDefinition` was\n  moved to `OperationDefinition`
  and `FragmentDefinition` since these are the\n  actual elements that have a location
  in the document.\n- `Validate.Rules` get the whole validation context (AST and schema).\n\n###
  Added\n- `Validate.Validation` contains data structures and functions used by the\n
  \ validator and concretet rules.\n- `Validate.Rules`: operation validation rules.\n\n##
  [0.9.0.0] - 2020-07-24\n### Fixed\n- Location of a parse error is returned in a
  singleton array with key\n  `locations`.\n- Parsing comments in the front of definitions.\n-
  Some missing labels were added to the parsers, some labels were fixed to\n  refer
  to the AST nodes being parsed. \n\n### Added\n- `AST` reexports `AST.Parser`.\n-
  `AST.Document.Location` is a token location as a line and column pair.\n- `Execute`
  reexports `Execute.Coerce`.\n- `Error.Error` is an error representation with a message
  and source location.\n- `Error.Response` represents a result of running a GraphQL
  query.\n- `Type.Schema` exports `Type` which lists all types possible in the schema.\n-
  Parsing subscriptions.\n- `Error.ResponseEventStream`, `Type.Out.Resolve`, `Type.Out.Subscribe`
  and\n  `Type.Out.SourceEventStream` define subscription resolvers.\n- `Error.ResolverException`
  is an exception that can be thrown by (field value\n  and event stream) resolvers
  to signalize an error. Other exceptions will\n  escape.\n- `Test.Hspec.GraphQL`
  contains some test helpers.\n- `Validate` contains the validator and standard rules.\n\n###
  Changed\n- `Type.Out.Resolver`: Interface fields don't have resolvers, object fields\n
  \ have value resolvers, root subscription type resolvers need an additional\n  resolver
  that creates an event stream. `Resolver` represents these differences\n  now and
  pairs a field with the function(s). Resolvers don't have `ExceptT`,\n  errors are
  handled with `MonadThrow`/`MonadCatch`.\n- All code from `Trans` is moved to `Type.Out`
  and exported by `Type` and\n  `Type.Out`.\n- `AST.Core` contained only `Arguments`
  which was moved to `Type.Definition`.\n  `AST` provides now only functionality related
  to parsing and encoding, as it\n  should be.\n- `Execute.execute` takes an additional
  argument, a possible operation name\n  and returns either a stream or the response.\n-
  `Error` module was changed to work with dedicated types for errors and the\n  response
  instead of JSON.\n- `graphqlSubs` takes an additional argument, the operation name.
  The type of\n  variable names is changed back to JSON since it is a common format
  and it\n  saves additional conversions. Custom format still can be used with the\n
  \ underlying functions (in the `Execute` module). The function returns either a\n
  \ a stream or the resolved value.\n- `graphql` returns either a stream or the resolved
  value.\n- The constraint of the base monad was changed to `MonadCatch` (and it implies\n
  \ `MonadThrow`).\n\n### Removed\n- `Trans.ActionT` is an unneeded layer of complexity.
  `Type.Out.Resolver`\n  represents possible resolver configurations.\n- `Execute.executeWithName`.
  `Execute.execute` takes the operation name and\n   completely replaces `executeWithName`.\n\n##
  [0.8.0.0] - 2020-06-20\n### Fixed\n- The parser rejects variables when parsing defaultValue
  (DefaultValue). The\n  specification defines default values as `Value` with `const`
  parameter and\n  constants cannot be variables. `AST.Document.ConstValue` was added,\n
  \ `AST.Document.ObjectField` was modified.\n- AST transformation should never fail.\n
  \   * Arguments and fields with a missing variable as value should be left out.\n
  \   * Invalid (recusrive or non-existing) fragments should be skipped.\n- Argument
  value coercion.\n- Variable value coercion.\n- Result coercion.\n- The executor
  should skip the fields missing in the object type and not fail.\n- Merging subselections.\n\n###
  Changed\n- `Schema.Resolver` was moved to `Type.Out`, it is a field and resolver
  function\n  pair.\n- `AST.Core.Value` was moved into `Type.Definition`. These values
  are used only\n  in the execution and type system, it is not a part of the parsing
  tree.\n- `Type` module is superseded by `Type.Out`. This module contains now only\n
  \ exports from other module that complete `Type.In` and `Type.Out` exports.\n- `Error.CollectErrsT`
  contains the new `Resolution` data structure.\n  `Resolution` represents the state
  used by the executor. It contains all types\n  defined in the schema and collects
  the thrown errors.\n\n### Added\n- `Type.Definition` contains base type system definition,
  e.g. Enums and\n  Scalars.\n- `Type.Schema` describes a schema. Both public functions
  that execute queries\n  accept a `Schema` now instead of a `HashMap`. The execution
  fails if the root\n  operation doesn't match the root Query type in the schema.\n-
  `Type.In` and `Type.Out` contain definitions for input and output types.\n- `Execute.Coerce`
  defines a typeclass responsible for input, variable value\n  coercion. It decouples
  us a bit from JSON since any format can be used to pass\n  query variables. Execution
  functions accept (`HashMap Name a`) instead of\n  `Subs`, where a is an instance
  of `VariableValue`.\n\n### Removed\n- `Schema.scalar`, `Schema.wrappedScalar`. They
  accepted everything can be\n  converted to JSON and JSON is not suitable as an internal
  representation for\n  GraphQL. E.g. GraphQL distinguishes between Floats and Integers.\n-
  `Schema.wrappedObject`, `Schema.object`, `Schema.resolversToMap`. There is no\n
  \ need in special functions to construct field resolvers anymore, resolvers are\n
  \ normal functions attached to the fields in the schema representation.\n- `Schema.resolve`
  is superseded by `Execute.Execution`.\n- `Error.runAppendErrs` isn't used anywhere.\n-
  `AST.Core`: `Document`, `Directive`, `Field`, `Fragment`, `Selection`, `Alias`\n
  \ `TypeCondition` were modified, moved into `Execute.Transform.Document` and\n  made
  private. These types describe intermediate representation used by the\n  executor
  internally. Moving was required to avoid cyclic dependencies between\n  the executor
  and type system.\n- `AST.Core` doesn't reexports anything.\n\n## [0.7.0.0] - 2020-05-11\n###
  Fixed\n- Result of null encoding\n- Block strings encoding\n- Result of tab and
  newline encoding\n\n### Added\n- AST for the GraphQL schema.\n- Type system definition
  parser.\n- `Trans.argument`.\n- Schema extension parser.\n- Contributing guidelines.\n-
  `Schema.resolversToMap` (intended to be used internally).\n\n### Changed\n- Rename
  `AST.Definition` into `AST.Document.ExecutableDefinition`.\n  `AST.Document.TypeSystemDefinition`
  and `AST.Document.TypeSystemExtension`\n  can also be definitions.\n- Move all AST
  data to `AST.Document` and reexport them.\n- Rename `AST.OperationSelectionSet`
  to `AST.Document.SelectionSet`.\n- Make `Schema.Subs` a `Data.HashMap.Strict` (was
  a function\n  `key -> Maybe value` before).\n- Make `AST.Lexer.at` a text (symbol)
  parser. It was a char before and is\n  `symbol \"@\"` now.\n- Replace `MonadIO`
  with a plain `Monad`. Since the tests don't use IO,\n  set the inner monad to `Identity`.\n-
  `NonEmpty (Resolver m)` is now `HashMap Text (NonEmpty (Resolver m))`. Root\n  operation
  type can be any type, therefore a hashmap is needed. Since types\n  cannot be empty,
  we save the list of resolvers in the type as a non-empty\n  list. Currently only
  \"Query\" and \"Mutation\" are supported as types. For more\n  schema support is
  required. The executor checks now if the type in the query\n  matches the type of
  the provided root resolvers.\n\n### Removed\n- `AST.Field`, `AST.InlineFragment`
  and `AST.FragmentSpread`.\n  These types are only used in `AST.Selection` and `AST.Selection`
  contains now\n  3 corresponding data constructors, `Field`, `InlineFragment` and\n
  \ `FragmentSpread`, instead of separate types. It simplifies pattern matching\n
  \ and doesn't make the code less typesafe.\n- `Schema.scalarA`.\n- `Schema.wrappedScalarA`.\n-
  `Schema.wrappedObjectA`.\n- `Schema.objectA`.\n- `AST.Argument`. Replaced with `AST.Arguments`
  which holds all arguments as a\n  key/value map.\n\n## [0.6.1.0] - 2019-12-23\n###
  Fixed\n- Parsing multiple string arguments, such as\n  `login(username: \"username\",
  password: \"password\")` would fail on the comma\n  due to strings not having a
  space consumer.\n- Fragment spread is evaluated based on the `__typename` resolver.
  If the\n  resolver is missing, it is assumed that the type condition is satisfied
  (all\n  fragments are included).\n- Escaping characters during encoding.\n\n###
  Added\n- Directive support (@skip and @include).\n- Pretifying multi-line string
  arguments as block strings.\n\n## [0.6.0.0] - 2019-11-27\n### Changed\n- `Language.GraphQL.Encoder`
  moved to `Language.GraphQL.AST.Encoder`.\n- `Language.GraphQL.Parser` moved to `Language.GraphQL.AST.Parser`.\n-
  `Language.GraphQL.Lexer` moved to `Language.GraphQL.AST.Lexer`.\n- All `Language.GraphQL.AST.Value`
  data constructor prefixes were removed. The\n  module should be imported qualified.\n-
  All `Language.GraphQL.AST.Core.Value` data constructor prefixes were removed.\n
  \ The module should be imported qualified.\n- `Language.GraphQL.AST.Core.Object`
  is now just a HashMap.\n- `Language.GraphQL.AST.Transform` is isn't exposed publically
  anymore.\n- `Language.GraphQL.Schema.resolve` accepts a selection `Seq` (`Data.Sequence`)\n
  \ instead of a list. Selections are stored as sequences internally as well.\n- Add
  a reader instance to the resolver's monad stack. The Reader contains\n  a Name/Value
  hashmap, which will contain resolver arguments.\n\n### Added\n- Nested fragment
  support.\n\n### Fixed\n- Consume ignored tokens after `$` and `!`. I mistakenly
  assumed that\n  `$variable` is a single token, same as `Type!` is a single token.
  This is not\n  the case, for example `Variable` is defined as `$ Name`, so these
  are two\n  tokens, therefore whitespaces and commas after `$` and `!` should be\n
  \ consumed.\n\n### Improved\n- `Language.GraphQL.AST.Parser.type_`: Try type parsers
  in a variable\n  definition in a different order to avoid using `but`.\n\n### Removed\n-
  `Language.GraphQL.AST.Arguments`. Use `[Language.GraphQL.AST.Argument]`\n  instead.\n-
  `Language.GraphQL.AST.Directives`. Use `[Language.GraphQL.AST.Directives]`\n  instead.\n-
  `Language.GraphQL.AST.VariableDefinitions`. Use\n  `[Language.GraphQL.AST.VariableDefinition]`
  instead.\n- `Language.GraphQL.AST.FragmentName`. Use `Language.GraphQL.AST.Name`
  instead.\n- `Language.GraphQL.Execute.Schema` - It was a resolver list, not a schema.\n-
  `Language.GraphQL.Schema`: `enum`, `enumA`, `wrappedEnum` and `wrappedEnumA`.\n
  \ Use `scalar`, `scalarA`, `wrappedScalar` and `wrappedScalarA` instead.\n\n\n##
  [0.5.1.0] - 2019-10-22\n### Deprecated\n- `Language.GraphQL.AST.Arguments`. Use
  `[Language.GraphQL.AST.Argument]`\n  instead.\n- `Language.GraphQL.AST.Directives`.
  Use `[Language.GraphQL.AST.Directives]`\n  instead.\n- `Language.GraphQL.AST.VariableDefinitions`.
  Use\n  `[Language.GraphQL.AST.VariableDefinition]` instead.\n\n### Added\n- Module
  documentation.\n- Inline fragment support.\n\n### Fixed\n- Top-level fragments.\n-
  Fragment for execution is chosen based on the type.\n\n## [0.5.0.1] - 2019-09-10\n###
  Added\n- Minimal documentation for all public symbols.\n\n### Deprecated\n- `Language.GraphQL.AST.FragmentName`.
  Replaced with Language.GraphQL.AST.Name.\n- `Language.GraphQL.Execute.Schema` -
  It is not a schema (at least not a\n  complete one), but a resolver list, and the
  resolvers should be provided by\n  the user separately, because the schema can originate
  from a GraphQL\n  document. `Schema` name should be free to provide a data type
  for the real\n  schema later.\n- `Language.GraphQL.Schema`: `enum`, `enumA`, `wrappedEnum`
  and `wrappedEnumA`.\n  There are actually only two generic types in GraphQL: Scalars
  and objects.\n  Enum is a scalar value.\n\n### Fixed\n- Parsing block string values.\n\n##
  [0.5.0.0] - 2019-08-14\n### Added\n- `executeWithName` executes an operation with
  the given name.\n- Export `Language.GraphQL.Encoder.definition`,\n  `Language.GraphQL.Encoder.type'`
  and `Language.GraphQL.Encoder.directive`.\n- Export `Language.GraphQL.Encoder.value`.
  Escapes \\ and \" in strings now.\n\n### Changed\n- `Operation` includes now possible
  operation name which allows to support\n  documents with multiple operations.\n-
  `Language.GraphQL.Encoder.document` and other encoding functions take a\n  `Formatter`
  as argument to distinguish between minified and pretty printing.\n- All encoder
  functions return `Data.Text.Lazy`.\n\n### Removed\n- Unused `Language.GraphQL.Encoder.spaced`.\n\n##
  [0.4.0.0] - 2019-07-23\n### Added\n- Support for mutations.\n- Error handling (with
  monad transformers).\n- Nullable types.\n- Arbitrary nested lists support.\n- Potential
  BOM header parsing.\n\n### Changed\n- attoparsec is replaced with megaparsec.\n-
  The library is now under `Language.GraphQL` (instead of `Data.GraphQL`).\n- HUnit
  and tasty are replaced with Hspec.\n- `Alternative`/`MonadPlus` resolver constraints
  are replaced with `MonadIO`.\n\n### Removed\n- Duplicates from `Language.GraphQL.AST`
  already available in\n  `Language.GraphQL.AST.Core`.\n- All module exports are now
  explicit, so private and help functions aren't\n  exported anymore.\n\n## [0.3]
  - 2015-09-22\n### Changed\n- Exact match numeric types to spec.\n- Names follow
  now the spec.\n- AST slightly different for better readability or easier parsing.\n-
  Replace golden test for test to validate parsing/encoding.\n\n### Added\n- Parsing
  errors in all cases where `Alternative` is used.\n- GraphQL encoder.\n\n### Fixed\n-
  Expect braces `inputValueDefinitions` instead of parens when parsing.\n\n## [0.2.1]
  - 2015-09-16\n### Fixed\n- Include data files for golden tests in Cabal package.\n-
  Support for ghc-7.8.\n\n## [0.2] - 2015-09-14\n### Added\n- Rudimentary parser for
  `GraphQL` which successfully parses the sample file\n  `kitchen-sink.graphql` from
  `graphql-js` tests.\n- Golden test for `kitchen-sink.grahql` parsing.\n### Changed\n-
  Many optional data types in `GraphQl` didn't need to be wrapped in a `Maybe`.\n-
  Some `newtype`s became type synonyms for easier parsing.\n\n## 0.1 - 2015-09-12\n###
  Added\n- Data types for the GraphQL language.\n\n[0.11.1.0]: https://www.caraus.tech/projects/pub-graphql/repository/23/diff?rev=v0.11.1.0&rev_to=v0.11.0.0\n[0.11.0.0]:
