  # hkd-lens

  A library for creating traversals for higher kinded data (HKD)
  following the method detailed by Sandy Maguire
  (http://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/higher-kinded-data). It expands
  on the methodology given there by including data with multiple
  constructors and by allowing type-changing traversals, ```Traverse s t a b```.

  This library currently supplies lenses, prisms, and traversals. However, the
  methodology only allows traversals which target a single specific location
  in a data structure. This is an inherent feature of the method and will
  not change. Consult the package "generic-lens" for generic ways of targeting
  multiple locations. Consult also "generic-lens" for also providing everything
  else in this package.

  ## Quick Start
  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE StandaloneDeriving #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric  #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds  #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE KindSignatures  #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies  #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE UndecidableInstances  #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE PolyKinds #-}

  module Test where

  import Generics.OneLiner --package one-liner
  import Control.Lens      --package lens, used here for operators, e.g. (^.)
  import HKD.Lens
  import GHC.TypeLits
  import GHC.Generics(Generic)

  ```
  First, we define a higher kinded data. Its a data wherein every field
  is wrapped in some control constructof `f`. The selection of `f` controls
  how the data is expressed.

  ```haskell
  type Character = Character' Z
  data Character' f a = Character { name :: HK f String
                                  , role :: HK f a }
                      deriving Generic
  data Protagonist = Hero | Sidekick deriving Show
  data Antagonist = Villian | Henchman deriving Show
  deriving instance (Constraints (Character' f a) Show)  --provided by one-liner
    => Show (Character' f a)

  ```
  This HKD is built not only with a control parameter, but with a type family,
  `HK`, which allows reversion to a lower, or base type, for the specially
  defined data `Z`.

  ```haskell
  data Z a
  type family HK (f :: ( * -> * ) ) a where
    HK Z a = a
    HK f a = f a

  ```
  A lens is made via the `LensesOf` type family to direct exactly what lenses
  will be made (this includes a Nat specifying the index of the control
  parameter), and the `makeLensesOf` function which supplies a Lens Kinded Data.

  ```haskell
  lensesForCharacters :: LensesOf (Character a) (Character b) 1
  lensesForCharacters = makeLensesOf
  ```

  What is a lens kinded data? Well, thats the original data parameterized by a
  `f = LensOf` type (exported from HKD.Lens). So, at each data field is a lens
  from the whole data to that field.

  For instance, the "role" lens is retrieved using the `role` field and unwrapping
  the `LensOf` data to reveal the lens.

  ```haskell
  roleLens :: Lens (Character a) (Character b) a b
  roleLens = getLensOf $ role lensesForCharacters

  ```
  Similarly, the `name` field reveals a lens targeting the `name` field of the
  base kinded `Character a`. Note that this lens does not involve a change in
  type parameters.

  ```haskell
  nameLens :: Lens (Character a) (Character a) String String
  nameLens = getLensOf $ name lensesForCharacters

  ```
  Here's an application of the role lens. It is used to turn "Villians" into
  "Heroes"; specifically the evil henchman "Number One" changes his ways.

  ```haskell
  redemption :: Antagonist -> Protagonist
  redemption Villian = Hero
  redemption Henchman = Sidekick

  evilNumberOne :: Character Antagonist
  evilNumberOne = Character "Number One" Henchman
  goodNumberOne = evilNumberOne & roleLens %~ redemption
  -- goodNumberOne = Character {name = "Number One", role = Sidekick}


  ```
  To showcase traversals, a `Scene` data type is created.
  ```haskell
  type Scene = Scene' Z
  data Scene' f a b = Meeting { inAttendence :: HK f [a]
                              , meetingPlace :: HK f Place }
                    | Confrontation { attacker :: HK f [a]
                                    , attackee :: HK f [b]
                                    , confrontationPlace :: HK f Place}
                  deriving Generic
  data Place = ARoom | TheMountainTop deriving Show
  deriving instance (Constraints (Scene' f a b) Show) => Show (Scene' f a b)

  ```
  Here the Traversal-kinded data for the `Meeting` constructor is made.
  ```haskell
  meetingTraversals :: TraversalsOf (Scene a b) (Scene a b) 1
  meetingTraversals = makeTraversalsOf @"Meeting"

  ```
  A specific `inAttendence` traversal is called out. Note that since the type
  variable `a` is used in more than one location, we cannot change it's type.
  ```haskell
  meetingAttendeeTraversal :: Traversal (Scene a b) (Scene a b) [a] [a]
  meetingAttendeeTraversal = getTraversalOf $ inAttendence meetingTraversals

  someoneWalksIn :: a -> Scene a b -> Scene a b
  someoneWalksIn a = meetingAttendeeTraversal %~ (a:)

  ```
  However, we could create a traversal that changes the type of `b`.
  ```haskell
  confrontationTraversals :: TraversalsOf (Scene a b) (Scene a b') 1
  confrontationTraversals = makeTraversalsOf @"Confrontation"

  ```
  We change a scene of good and evil characters to a scene of evil and evil
  characters through the use of a Mind Control traversal.
  ```haskell
  evilMindControl :: Protagonist -> Antagonist
  evilMindControl _ = Henchman

  useMindControlGun :: Scene (Character Antagonist) (Character Protagonist)
                    -> Scene (Character Antagonist) (Character Antagonist)
  useMindControlGun = getTraversalOf (attackee confrontationTraversals)
                    . mapped . roleLens
                    %~ evilMindControl

  poorNumberOneTrappedInARoom
    :: Scene (Character Antagonist) (Character Protagonist)
  poorNumberOneTrappedInARoom = Confrontation [] [goodNumberOne] ARoom

  numberOneReadyForEvilOnceAgain
    :: Scene (Character Antagonist) (Character Antagonist)
  numberOneReadyForEvilOnceAgain = useMindControlGun poorNumberOneTrappedInARoom
  -- Confrontation [] [Character "Number One" Henchman}] ARoom


  ```
  Ok, enough of the Hero business, the library also supplies Prisms.
  ```haskell
  type AB = AB' Z
  data AB' f a b = A {getA::(HK f a)} | B (HK f b) deriving Generic
  deriving instance (Constraints (AB' f a b) Show) => Show (AB' f a b)
  aPrism :: PrismsOf (AB a b) (AB c d) 1
  aPrism = makePrismsOf @"A"

  its1 = (A 1 :: AB Int ()) ^? getPrismOf (getA aPrism)


  ```
  Finally, lenses/prisms/traversals may also be provided for types whose fields
  match their type parameters. These are the most fundamental/simplest types.
  This is accomplished by signaling there is no HKD parameter with a 0 for the
  Nat which targets the HKD parameter.
  ```haskell
  _1 :: Lens (a,b) (c,b) a c
  _1 = getLensOf . fst $ (makeLensesOf :: LensesOf (a,b) (c,d) 0)
  ```
