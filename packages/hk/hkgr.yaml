  `hkgr` (pronounced "hackager") is a tool for making releases of
  Haskell packages on Hackage.

  ## Usage

  ```
  $ hkgr
  Hackage Release tool

  Usage: hkgr [--version] COMMAND
    'Hackager' is a tool for easy Hackage package release workflow

  Available options:
    -h,--help                Show this help text
    --version                Show version

  Available commands:
    tagdist                  'git tag' version and 'cabal sdist' tarball
    upload                   'cabal upload' candidate tarball to Hackage
    publish                  Publish to Hackage ('cabal upload --publish')
    upload-haddock           Upload candidate documentation to Hackage
    publish-haddock          Publish documentation to Hackage
    version                  Show the package version from .cabal file
  ```

  ## Explanation

  You are preparing for a release...

  So you commit changes to your package and push them to check CI results:

  ```
  $ git commit -m "new release"
  $ git push
  ```


  ### tagdist
  Now you want to make a dist tarball, which is done from a git tag:
  ```
  $ hkgr tagdist
  ```
  The `tagdist` command first reads the current package version
  (from the `.cabal` file in the current directory), and uses that to `git tag`.
  It then runs `cabal sdist` from a temporary pristine checkout of the tag
  to generate the dist tarball.

  If the tag already exists (eg if you already ran `tagdist` earlier),
  and you need to add commits to the release
  you can use `--force` to move the tag to the latest commit
  and generate a new tarball off that,
  otherwise `tagdist` refuses to run again to prevent accidently overwriting
  the tag and dist tarball.

  One should not be able to `tagdist` on an already published
  (ie released) version.

  (If sdist fails for some reason then hkgr tries to reset the tag.)

  ### upload
  If all is good, it's time for a candidate release:

  ```
  $ hkgr upload
  ```
  This uploads a candidate dist tarball to Hackage: this can be repeated.

  Haddock draft documentation can also be uploaded if desired:
  ```
  $ hkgr upload-haddock
  ```

  ### publish
  Once you are happy, you can release to Hackage:

  ```
  $ hkgr publish
  ```

  If it succeeds then hkgr creates a "published lockfile" in `dist/`,
  and the git tag is pushed to origin.

  (Then hkgr will refuse to do further commands on the released version.)

  Optionally one can publish haddock docs:
  ```
  $ hkgr publish-haddock
  ```

  ## Requirements

  hkgr uses `cabal-install`, `git`, and also `hlint` if available.
