  `plot-light` provides functionality for rendering 2D graphics. It is geared in particular
  towards scientific plotting, and it is called "light" because it only requires a
  few common Haskell dependencies.

  It builds upon `blaze-svg` by adding type-safe combinators, geometry primitives
  and high-level graphing functionality.


  ## Usage


  To use this project you just need `import Graphics.Rendering.Plot.Light`. If GHC
  complains of name clashes you can import the module in "qualified" form.



  ## Documentation


  Available on Hackage : https://hackage.haskell.org/package/plot-light in the `Graphics.Rendering.Plot.Light`
  module


  ## Contributing


  You can use `plot-light` in your own projects (either personal, academic or commercial).
  All feedback such as comments, bug reports, new documentation, feature requests
  and patches is welcome.
