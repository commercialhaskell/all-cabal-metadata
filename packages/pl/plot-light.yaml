  # plot-light

  A lightweight plotting library

  `plot-light` provides functionality for rendering 2D graphics. It is geared in particular towards scientific plotting, and it is called "light" because it only requires a few common Haskell dependencies.
  It builds upon `blaze-svg` by adding type-safe combinators, geometry primitives and high-level graphing functionality.

  ## Usage

  To use this project you just need `import Graphics.Rendering.Plot.Light`. If GHC complains of name clashes you can import the module in "qualified" form.


  ## Documentation

  Available on Hackage : https://hackage.haskell.org/package/plot-light in the `Graphics.Rendering.Plot.Light` module

  ## Contributing

  You can use `plot-light` in your own projects (either personal, academic or commercial). All feedback such as comments, bug reports, new documentation, feature requests and patches is welcome.
