description: |-
  Often when counting you don't need an exact count, but only whether there are
  two things. Two examples:

  When searching for inhabitants of a type (implementations of a program), you
  want to be able to tell whether there are (a) no possible inhabitants, (b) a
  unique inhabitant, or (c) multiple inhabitants.

  When displaying the name of a variable, if there's exactly one variable of a
  given name ("a") you can just use that name, but if there are multiples you
  might use a unique id to disambiguate them ("a1" vs "a2").
