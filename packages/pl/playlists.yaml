changelog: ! "# Version 0.5.0.0 (December 1, 2017)\n\n  * Add support for track length
  (thanks to Catherine Galkina)\n\n  * Widen dependency versions to latest available.\n\n#
  Version 0.4.1.0 (February 5, 2017)\n\n  * Remove redundant constraints as reported
  by GHC 8.X.\n\n  * Widen dependency versions to latest available.\n\n# Version 0.4.0.0
  (November 21, 2016)\n\n  * Added the `resolve` function.  If you have a playlist
  that\n    contains references to remote playlists, this new function will\n    recursively
  download and process playlists until it has a flat\n    playlist with no further
  remote references.\n\n    See the `playlists-http` package for an example of using
  the\n    `resolve` function.\n\n  * Added the `parserForFormat` function which directly
  exposes the\n    `attoparsec` parser for each playlist type.  This should make it\n
  \   easy to write space efficient functions that parse playlists.\n\n# Version 0.3.0.0
  (January 24, 2015)\n\n  * Update dependencies to recent versions (thanks to Wieland
  Hoffmann).\n"

description: ! "# Haskell Playlists Library and Tool\n\nPlaylists is a library for
  working with media playlist files.  The\noriginal motivation for the library was
  extracting URLs for streaming\nradio stations that use PLS and M3U playlist files.\n\nThe
  package also includes an executable that can dump the URLs from a\nplaylist file
  and convert between playlist file formats.\n\n## Supported Formats\n\n  * [PLS]
  []\n  * [M3U and M3U8] [M3U]\n\n## Future Plans\n\nSome playlist files can be really
  big.  I plan on adding support for\nincremental parsing and generating via [io-streams]
  [] at some point\nin the future.\n\n## Library Example\n\n    import qualified Data.ByteString
  as BS\n    import Text.Playlist\n\n    readPlaylist :: Format -> IO Playlist\n    readPlaylist
  fmt = do\n      content <- BS.getContents\n      case parsePlaylist fmt content
  of\n        Left err -> fail $ \"failed to parse playlist on stdin: \" ++ err\n
  \       Right x  -> return x\n\n\n## Executable Example\n\n    $ playlist urls --format
  PLS < somefile.pls\n\n    $ playlist convert --from PLS --to M3U < somefile.pls\n\n[pls]:
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLS_(file_format)\n[m3u]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U\n[io-streams]:
  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/io-streams\n"
