description: "# PlotFont\n\nCrude fonts suitable for plotting.\n\nThere are many good
  looking fonts which optimize for appearance. I wanted\nsome cruder fonts which had
  a simpler representation: a relatively small\nnumber of straight lines which could
  easily be plotted by a machine, or\nperhaps a person.\n\n# Example\n\nHere is an
  example using diagrams to generate a SVG file:\n\n```haskell\nimport qualified Graphics.PlotFont
  as PF\n\nimport Diagrams.Prelude\nimport Diagrams.Backend.SVG\n\nstrokes :: [[(Double,Double)]]
  \   \nstrokes = PF.render' PF.canvastextFont \"Hello World!\"\n\ntoDiag :: [[(Double,Double)]]
  -> Diagram SVG\ntoDiag = extrudeLeft 20 . mconcat . map (fromVertices . map p2)\n\nmain
  :: IO ()         \nmain = renderSVG \"hello.svg\" (mkSizeSpec2D (Just 800) (Just
  200)) $\n          toDiag strokes # lw 3\n```\n\n# Licenses\n\nThe code written
  by me is licensed under the GPL, version 2 or later.\n\nThe data for the fonts come
  from Jim Studt's canvastext.js\nhttp://jim.studt.net/canvastext/ which he placed
  in the public\ndomain. He cites the original source as the Hershey fonts:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hershey_fonts\n\nThe
  Hershey fonts appear to have this license:\n\n1. The following acknowledgements
  must be distributed with\n   the font data:\n\n      - The Hershey Fonts were originally
  created by Dr.\n        A. V. Hershey while working at the U. S.\n        National
  Bureau of Standards.\n\n     - The format of the Font data in this distribution\n
  \       was originally created by\n          James Hurt\n          Cognition, Inc.\n
  \         900 Technology Park Drive\n          Billerica, MA 01821\n          (mit-eddie!ci-dandelion!hurt)\n\n2.
  The font data in this distribution may be converted into\n   any other format *EXCEPT*
  the format distributed by\n   the U.S. NTIS (which organization holds the rights\n
  \  to the distribution and use of the font data in that\n   particular format).
  Not that anybody would really\n   *want* to use their format... each point is described\n
  \  in eight bytes as \"xxx yyy:\", where xxx and yyy are\n   the coordinate values
  as ASCII numbers.\n\nIt is not clear to me if Mr Studt used 'this distribution'.\n"
