description: |-
  This is a framework for untyped, symbolic computations like a CAS
  does, without any baked-in rules whatsoever but the ability to
  define expressions very consisely, as well as any transformation
  rules you want. The idea is basically to combine the flexibility
  of a Lisp with the conciseness of a Regex engine, using syntax similar
  to Haskell's standard pattern matching.
