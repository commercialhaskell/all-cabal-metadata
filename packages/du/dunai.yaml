description: |-
  Dunai is a DSL for strongly-typed CPS-based composable transformations.

  Dunai is based on a concept of Monadic Stream Functions (MSFs). MSFs are
  transformations defined by a function @unMSF :: MSF m a b -> a -> m (b, MSF m a b)@
  that executes one step of a simulation, and produces an output in a monadic
  context, and a continuation to be used for future steps.

  MSFs are a generalisation of the implementation mechanism used by Yampa,
  Wormholes and other FRP and reactive implementations.

  When combined with different monads, they produce interesting effects. For
  example, when combined with the @Maybe@ monad, they become transformations
  that may stop producing outputs (and continuations). The @Either@ monad gives
  rise to MSFs that end with a result (akin to Tasks in Yampa, and Monadic
  FRP).

  Flattening, that is, going from some structure @MSF (t m) a b@ to @MSF m a b@
  for a specific transformer @t@ often gives rise to known FRP constructs. For
  instance, flattening with @EitherT@ gives rise to switching, and flattening
  with @ListT@ gives rise to parallelism with broadcasting.

  MSFs can be used to implement many FRP variants, including Arrowized FRP,
  Classic FRP, and plain reactive programming. Arrowized and applicative
  syntax are both supported.
