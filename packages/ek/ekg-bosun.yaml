  Other Changes\n\n* Increased the upper bound of `time` to allow < 1.9.\n* Increased
  the upper bound of `wreq` to allow < 0.6.\n\n## 1.0.7\n\n* Increased the upper-bound
  of `aeson`, `http-client`, `time` and `vector`.\n\n## 1.0.6\n\n* Increased the upper-bound
  of `aeson`, `base` and `time`.\n\n## 1.0.5\n\n* Increased the upper-bound of aeson
  to allow < 0.11. Thanks to @bitemyapp for\n  noticing and fixing this.\n* Increased
  the upper-bound of vector to allow < 0.12.\n\n## 1.0.4\n\n* Increased the upper-bound
  of base to allow < 4.9. Now builds on\n  GHC 7.10.1.\n* Increased the upper-bound

  are `Double` may post `null` if\n  they are NaN or infinity - in this case we filter
  the submissions out.\n\n## 1.0.1\n\n* Relax dependencies for aeson, http-client,
  text, network and network-uri.\n  Thanks to @k0001 (Renzo Carbonara) for this work.\n\n\n##
