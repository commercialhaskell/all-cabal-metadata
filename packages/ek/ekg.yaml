  the internals were split off into a new package, ekg-core.\n\n * The `Gauge.modify`
  function was removed, as it can't be supported\n   by the new, more efficient implementation

  0.3.1.3 (2013-02-22)\n\n * Fixed security issue where ekg would always listen to
  all incoming\n   requests, even if \"localhost\" was specified.\n\n * Always export
  par_tot_bytes_copied. Previously it was only exported\n   if using base-4.6 and
  later.\n\n## 0.3.1.2 (2012-09-18)\n\n * Support GHC 7.6\n\n## 0.3.1.1 (2012-06-25)\n\n
  * Bump dependencies.\n\n## 0.3.1.0 (2012-04-17)\n\n * Add labels, which are free-form
  string values exported by the\n   monitoring server.  Labels allow you to export
  e.g. the command\n   line arguments used to start the executable or the host name
  it's\n   running on.\n\n## 0.3.0.4 (2012-04-03)\n\n * Add original JavaScript files
  to tarball to ease distribution\n   packaging.\n\n## 0.3.0.4 (2012-04-03)\n\n *
  Change icons to Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licensed one\n\n## 0.3.0.3 (2012-03-19)\n\n
  * Support Snap 0.8\n\n## 0.3.0.2 (2012-03-07)\n\n * Don't require an internet connection,
  by serving Bootstrap CSS and\n   jQuery from the monitoring server.\n\n## 0.3.0.1
  (2012-01-26)\n\n * Switch from Blueprint to Bootstrap CSS\n\n * Overhaul look-and-feel\n\n##
  0.3.0.0 (2012-01-01)\n\n * Add gauges and change counters to always be monotonically
  increasing\n\n * Add web interface column headers\n\n * Reorganize the web interface

  separate access to counters and gauges\n\n * Return the server time in the JSON
  response it and use server time\n   instead of client time when graphing\n\n * Make
  it possible to graph user-defined counters and gauges\n\n * Format numbers using
  comma separators\n\n * Show a message box when the server can't be reached\n\n##

description: "# EKG: Remote monitoring of running processes over HTTP [![Hackage version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/ekg.svg?label=Hackage)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ekg)
  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/tibbe/ekg.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/tibbe/ekg)\n\nThis
  library lets you remotely monitor a running process over HTTP.\nIt provides a simple
  way to integrate a monitoring server into any\napplication.\n\n# Getting started\n\nAdding
  monitoring to your application is simple.  Just launch the\nmonitoring server as
  soon as your application starts\n\n    import System.Remote.Monitoring\n    \n    main
  = do\n         forkServer \"localhost\" 8000\n         ...\n\nand then visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
  in\nyour web browser.\n\nTo make full use out of this module you must first enable
  GC\nstatistics collection in the run-time system. To enable GC\nstatistics collection,
  either run your program with\n\n> +RTS -T\n\nor compile it with\n\n> -with-rtsopts=-T\n\nThe
  runtime overhead of `-T` is very small so it's safe to always\nleave it enabled.\n\n#
  JSON API\n\nThe monitoring server also lets you to retrieve the stats as JSON.\nSimply
  send the server an HTTP GET request with the Accept header set\nto \"application/json\":\n\n
  \   curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" http://localhost:8000/\n\nYou can use the
  JSON API to e.g. write applications that monitor other\napplications.\n\n# Get involved!\n\nPlease
  report bugs via the\n[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/tibbe/ekg/issues).\n\nMaster
