  # CHANGELOG

  # Upcoming...

  # v0.0.1.6

  - Fix a bug where batched metrics would send an empty list to the server. This
    causes the service to respond with an error.

  # v0.0.1.5

  - Batch metric requests to Cloudwatch, resulting in cheaper operations.

  # `ekg-cloudwatch`

  Register a thread, and suddenly all your [`ekg`][ekg] metrics get pushed to Amazon CloudWatch. Neat!

  Inspired (and copied) from the [`ekg-statsd`][ekg-statsd] package.

  # Usage:

  Pass your EKG `Store` and the Amazonka `Env` to the function:

  ```haskell
  import System.Metrics as EKG
  import Network.AWS    as AWS

  register :: EKG.Store -> AWS.Env -> IO CloudWatchId
  register store env =
    forkCloudWatch
      (defaultCloudWatchEnv "MyApplication" env)
      store
  ```
