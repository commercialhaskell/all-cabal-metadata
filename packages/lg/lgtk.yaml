changelog: |+
  = lgtk-0.8.0.4 =

  Depend on lensref-0.2

  = lgtk-0.8.0.3 =

  Relax dependencies

  = lgtk-0.8 =

  Lots of changes since the previously announced version, lgtk-0.5.3.

  == New features ==

  * New GLFW backend - Gtk is not strictly needed any more
  * Diagrams canvas with mouse and keyboard interaction support
  * Widget rendering in canvas
  * Horizontal sliders (called scales in Gtk)
  * Updated demo application

  == Architectural changes ==

  * Lens references splitted off to the separate package lensref.
  * Switch from data-lens to Edward Kmett's lens library
  * Upgrade to work with GHC 8.2
  * Repository moved to GitHub

  == Inner changes ==

  * Cleaned up widgets interface: simpler inner representation of widgets; eliminate `SafeIO` and `action`

  == Other changes ==

  * Bugfixes


  = lgtk-0.5.3 =

  * bugfix: handle focus out events for entries
  * bugfix: run postponed actions at widget initialization

  = lgtk-0.5.2 =

  * Better support for references with equality
  * Documentation fixes and cleanup
  * Inner change: safer state handling with MVars

  = lgtk-0.5.1 =

  * Documentation fixes and cleanup
  * Try to support Haskell Platform 2012.4.0.0

  = lgtk-0.5 =

  * Do not use monadic lenses any more.
  * Support for asynchronous events.
  * Lazily created tabs.
  * Inactive tabs are really inactive (event handlers are detached).
  * File references watch the files. When the file changes, the GUI is updated.
  * References with inherent identity (makes defining auto-sensitive buttons easier)
  * Experimental support for coloured buttons.
  * More examples in the demo application.
  * Lots of inner changes.

  LGtk is a GUI Toolkit.

  Main goals of LGtk:

  -Provide a Haskell EDSL for declarative description of interactive graphical applications

  -Provide an API for custom widget design

  -Provide a playground for high-level declarative features like
  derived state-save and undo-redo operations and
  type-driven GUI generation
