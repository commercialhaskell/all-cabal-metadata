  A package that can be used to render CSS easing functions. One can use the
  `Easing` type to specify how the "speed" of a certain animation should be
  handled in time.

  This package can be used in other items, such as objects that are then converted
  to JSON to make it more safe, since it narrows the amount of possible css
  strings to valid CSS easing functions.

  The package documentation can be found on the [GitHub pages](https://hapytex.github.io/css-easings/).

  ## Easing structure

  There are two types of CSS easings:

   1. A `steps(n, jump-term)` with *n* the number of steps, and *jump-term* the type of jump; and
   2. A `quadratic-bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2)`
      that works with a quaratic Bezier curve. Here both `x1` and `x2` need to between 0 and 1.

  The type that we use for easings in this package is `Easing`.

  There are four types of jumps: `jump-start`, `jump-end`, `jump-none`, and
  `jump-both`. `start` and `end` are aliasses for `jump-start` and `jump-end`
  respectively. The type we use in this package for these is `JumpTerm`.

  Besides that, CSS has some aliasses for common easing types like `steps-start`,
  `steps-end`, `ease`, `linear`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`, and `ease-in-out`.

  PostCSS defines extra aliases like:

   1. `easeInSine`, `easeOutSine`, and `easeInOutSine`;
   2. `easeInQuad`, `easeOutQuad`, and `easeInOutQuad`;
   3. `easeInCubic`, `easeOutCubic`, and `easeInOutCubic`;
   4. `easeInQuant`, `easeOutQuant`, and `easeInOutQuant`;
   5. `easeInQuint`, `easeOutQuint`, and `easeInOutQuint`;
   6. `easeInExpo`, `easeOutExpo`, and `easeInOutExpo`;
   7. `easeInCirc`, `easeOutCirc`, and `easeInOutCirc`; and
   8. `easeInBack`, `easeOutBack`, and `easeInOutBack`.

  These are also included as patterns in this project. When these are rendered,
  for example as a JSON string, it will use the CSS equivalent.

  ## `ToMarkup`, `ToJSON`, and `ToJavascript` instances

  Both the `JumpTerm` and `Easing` type are members of the `ToMarkup`, `ToJSON`
  and `ToJavascript` type classes to convert the easings to their text equivalent.

  For the `ToMarkup`, the CSS counterparts are just written to the markup stream,
  and thus *not* wrapped in a string literal. Since the possible easings do not
  contain any characters that need to be escaped, there is no problem with
  escaping.

  For both `ToJavascript` and `ToJSON` instances, the values are wrapped in a JSON
  string, since in many Javascript libraries, one uses strings to update easings.

  ## `Arbitrary` css easings

  One can generate arbitrary `Easing`s and `JumpTerm`s. It is however not advisable to
  use this for anything other than for validation purposes (like with `QuickCheck`).

  ## `css-easings` is not *safe* Haskell

  There are not extensions that are used that make the library *itself*
  unsafe, but it makes use of `aeson`, `blaze-markup`, etc. and the packages are
  not safe. Hence this package is not *safe Haskell*.
