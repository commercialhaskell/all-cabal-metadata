  ## Executive Summary
  This library allows for reading and writing to and from CSV files in a streaming manner.  Files can be read and written to on a row-by-row basis allowing larger files to be worked with, since the whole file doesn't have to be loaded to manipulate it.  It is based on the [conduit](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit] library.
