synopsis: Operations on zip archives
changelog: |
  ## Zip 1.7.1

  * Fixed compilation with zstd and/or bzip2 disabled.

  ## Zip 1.7.0

  * Set user permissions on linux platform as follows: if an existing file is
    added, use its permissions; if an entry is generated from a bytestring or
    a stream, use 0600. This behavior mimics the zip utility.

  ## Zip 1.6.0

  * Added support for Zstandard (zstd) compression

  * Added a Cabal flag `-fdisable-zstd` to remove the zstd C library
    dependency and hence support for Zstd entries.

  ## Zip 1.5.0

  * Added the `packDirRecur'` function.

  * Dropped support for GHC 8.4.

  ## Zip 1.4.1

  * Fixed the build on Mac.

  ## Zip 1.4.0

  * The “version made by” info inside archive now correctly sets Unix as the
    OS that produced the archive when the library is compiled on Unix. This
    allows other utilities such as `unzip` to read and correctly restore file
    permissions. [Issue 62](https://github.com/mrkkrp/zip/issues/62).

  * Added the `Codec.Archive.Zip.Unix` module.

  ## Zip 1.3.2

  * Fix a bug where removing a temporary file failed in the prescence of
    async exceptions.

  ## Zip 1.3.1

  * The test suite is now faster.

  ## Zip 1.3.0

  * Dropped support for GHC 8.2 and older.

  * Added a Cabal flag `-fdisable-bzip2` to remove the bzip2 C library
    dependency and hence support for BZip2 entries.

  ## Zip 1.2.0

  * Added the `setExternalFileAttrs` function and the `edExternalFileAttrs`
    field in the `EntryDescription` record.

  ## Zip 1.1.0

  * Made `saveEntry` and `unpackInto` restore modification time of files.

  ## Zip 1.0.0

  * Works with `conduit-1.3.0`, `conduit-extra-1.3.0`, `resourcet-1.2.0` and
    `bzlib-conduit-0.3.0`.

  * Stop depending on `path`, `path-io`, and `plub-b`.

  * Made the module `Codec.Archive.Zip.Type` non-public.

  * Remove derived instances of `Data` and `Generic` for `EntrySelector` not
    to expose its inner structure.

  * Change signature of the `loadEntry` function, its second argument is now
    just `EntrySelector` of the entry to add.

  * The second argument of `packDirRecur` now receives paths that are relative
    to the root of the directory we pack.

  ## Zip 0.2.0

  * Added `MonadBase` and `MonadBaseControl` instances for the `ZipArchive`
    monad. Also exported the `ZipState` type without revealing its data
    constructor and records.

  * Dropped `MonadThrow` and `MonadCatch` constraints for `createArchive` and
    `withArchive`.

  ## Zip 0.1.11

  * Minor refactoring.

  * Improved documentation and metadata.

  ## Zip 0.1.10

  * Made `getEntrySource` polymorphic in terms of the `Source` it returns.

  * Numerous cosmetic corrections to the docs.

  * Derived `Eq` and `Ord` for `EntrySelectorException` and `ZipException`.

  ## Zip 0.1.9

  * Fixed a bug with modification time serialization on 32 bit systems.

  ## Zip 0.1.8

  * Fixed a bug that caused `zip` to write incorrect number of entries
    (instead of `0xffff`) in central directory when Zip64 feature is enabled.

  ## Zip 0.1.7

  * Fix literal overflows on 32 bit systems.

  ## Zip 0.1.6

  * Allowed `time-1.7`.

  * Fixed an issue when empty archives with Zip 64 feature enabled could not
    be read (the “Parsing of archive structure failed: Cannot locate end of
    central directory”).

  ## Zip 0.1.5

  * Switched to using `withBinaryFile` instead of `withFile`, because the
    latter does nasty conversions on Windows, see docs for `openBinaryFile`.

  ## Zip 0.1.4

  * Added several simple code examples in `Codec.Archive.Zip`.

  * Derived `Typeable`, `Data`, `Generic` for `EntrySelector`.

  * Derived `Typeable` for `EntryDescription`.

  * Derived `Show`, `Ord`, `Bounded`, `Data`, and `Typeable` for
    `CompressionMethod`.

  * Derived `Read`, `Ord`, `Typeable`, and `Data` for `ArchiveDescription`.

  ## Zip 0.1.3

  * Improved speed of detection of invalid archives.

  * Introduced `getEntrySource` function.

  ## Zip 0.1.2

  * Relaxed dependency on `semigroups`.

  * Added explicit check of “version needed to extract”, so if archive uses
    some advanced features that we do not support yet, parsing fails.

  * Value of “version needed to extract” field is now calculated dynamically
    with respect to actually used features, e.g. if you just store or deflate
    a not very big file, `2.0` version will be written (previously we wrote
    `4.6` unconditionally). This is needed to avoid scaring tools that can
    only handle basic Zip archives.

  ## Zip 0.1.1

  * Make decoding of CP437 faster.

  ## Zip 0.1.0

  * Initial release.

  This is a feature-rich, memory-efficient, and type-safe library to
  manipulate Zip archives. The library is the most complete and efficient
  implementation of the .ZIP specification in Haskell (at least from the
  open-sourced ones). In particular, it's created with large multimedia data
  in mind and provides all features users might expect, comparable in terms of
  feature-set with libraries like `libzip` in C.

  ## Why this library is written

  There are a few libraries to work with Zip archives, yet every one of them
  provides only a subset of useful functionality or otherwise is flawed in
  some way so it cannot be easily used in some situations. Let's examine all
  libraries available on Hackage to understand the motivation for this
  package.

  ### zip-archive

  `zip-archive` is a widely used library. It's quite old, well-known and
  simple to use. However, it creates Zip archives purely, as `ByteStrings`s in
  memory. This is not acceptable if you work with big data. For example, if
  you have a collection of files with the total size 500 MB and you want to
  pack them into an archive, you can easily consume up to 1 GB of memory (the
  files plus the resulting archive). This is not always affordable. Even if
  you want just to look at the list of archive entries it will read the entire
  archive into memory.

  ### LibZip

  This is a binding to the C library [`libzip`][libzip]. There is always a
  certain kind of trouble with bindings. For example, you need to ensure that
  the target library is installed and its version is compatible with the
  version of your binding.

  It's not that bad with libraries that do not break their API for years, but
  it's not the case with `libzip`. As the maintainer of `LibZip` puts it:

  > libzip 0.10, 0.11, and 1.0 are not binary compatible. If your C library is
  > 0.11.x, then you should use LibZip 0.11. If your C library is 1.0, then
  > you should use LibZip master branch (not yet released to Hackage).

  Now, on my machine I have the version 1.0. To put the package on Stackage we
  had to use the version 0.10, because Stackage uses Ubuntu to build packages
  and libraries on Ubuntu are always ancient. This means that I cannot use the
  version of the library from Stackage, and I don't yet know what will be on
  the server.

  After much frustration, I decided to avoid using `LibZip`. After all, this
  is not a project that shouldn't be done completely in Haskell. By rewriting
  this in Haskell, I also can make it safer to use.

  ### zip-conduit

  This one uses the right approach: leverage a good streaming library
  (`conduit`) for memory-efficient processing. The library is however not
  feature-rich and has certain problems (including the programming style, it
  uses `error` if an entry is missing in the archive, among other things),
  some of them are reported on its issue tracker. It also does not appear to
  be maintained (the last sign of activity was on December 23, 2014).

  ## Features

  The library supports all features specified in the modern .ZIP specification
  except for encryption and multi-disk archives. See more about this below.

  For reference, here is a [copy of the specification][specification].

  ### Compression methods

  `zip` supports the following compression methods:

  * Store (no compression, just store files “as is”)
  * [DEFLATE]
  * [Bzip2]
  * [Zstandard]

  The best way to add a new compression method to the library is to write a
  conduit that will do the compression and publish it as a library. `zip` can
  then depend on it and add it to the list of supported compression methods.
  The current list of compression methods reflects what is available on
  Hackage at the moment.

  ### Encryption

  Encryption is currently not supported. Encryption system described in the
  .ZIP specification is known to be seriously flawed, so it's probably not the
  best way to protect your data anyway. The encryption method seems to be a
  proprietary technology of PKWARE (at least that's what stated about it in
  the .ZIP specification), so to hell with it.

  ### Sources of file data

  The following sources are supported:

  * *File name.* This is an efficient method to perform compression or
    decompression. You specify where to get data or where to save it and the
    rest is handled by the library.
  * *Conduit source or sink.*
  * *ByteString.* Use it only with small data.
  * *Copy file from another archive.* An efficient operation, file is copied
    “as is”—no re-compression is performed.

  ### ZIP64

  When necessary, the `ZIP64` extension is automatically used. It's necessary
  when:

  * The total size of the archive is greater than 4 GB.
  * The size of a single compressed/uncompressed file in the archive is
    greater than 4 GB.
  * There are more than 65535 entries in the archive.

  The library is particularly well suited for processing large files. For
  example, I've been able to create 6.5 GB archive with reasonable speed and
  without significant memory consumption.

  ### Filenames

  The library has an API that makes it impossible to create archive with
  non-portable or invalid file names in it.

  As of .ZIP specification 6.3.2, files with Unicode symbols in their names
  can be stored in Zip archives. The library supports mechanisms for this and
  uses them automatically when needed. Besides UTF-8, CP437 is also supported
  as per the specification.

  ### Meta-information about files

  The library allows us to attach comments to the entire archive or individual
  files, and also gives its user full control over extra fields that are
  written to file headers, so the user can store arbitrary information about
  files in the archive.

  ## Quick start

  The module `Codec.Archive.Zip` provides everything you may need to
  manipulate Zip archives. There are three things that should be clarified
  right away to avoid confusion.

  First, we use the `EntrySelector` type that can be obtained from relative
  `FilePath`s (paths to directories are not allowed). This method may seem
  awkward at first, but it will protect you from the problems with portability
  when your archive is unpacked on a different platform.

  Second, there is no way to add directories, or to be precise, *empty
  directories* to your archive. This approach is used in Git and I find it
  sane.

  Finally, the third feature of the library is that it does not modify the
  archive instantly, because doing so on every manipulation would often be
  inefficient. Instead, we maintain a collection of pending actions that can
  be turned into an optimized procedure that efficiently modifies the archive
  in one pass. Normally, this should be of no concern to you, because all
  actions are performed automatically when you leave the `ZipArchive` monad.
  If, however, you ever need to force an update, the `commit` function is your
  friend.

  Let's take a look at some examples that show how to accomplish most common
  tasks.

  To get full information about archive entries, use `getEntries`:

  ```haskell
  λ> withArchive archivePath (M.keys <$> getEntries)
  ```

  This will return a list of all entries in the archive at `archivePath`. It's
  possible to extract contents of an entry as a strict `ByteString`:

  ```haskell
  λ> withArchive archivePath (getEntry entrySelector)
  ```

  …to stream them to a given sink:

  ```haskell
  λ> withArchive archivePath (sourceEntry entrySelector mySink)
  ```

  …to save a specific entry to a file:

  ```haskell
  λ> withArchive archivePath (saveEntry entrySelector pathToFile)
  ```

  …and finally just unpack the entire archive into a directory:

  ```haskell
  λ> withArchive archivePath (unpackInto destDir)
  ```

  See also `getArchiveComment` and `getArchiveDescription`.

  Modifying is also easy. When you want to create a new archive use
  `createArchive`, otherwise `withArchive` will do. To add an entry from
  `ByteString`:

  ```haskell
  λ> createArchive archivePath (addEntry Store "Hello, World!" entrySelector)
  ```

  You can stream from `Source` as well:

  ```haskell
  λ> createArchive archivePath (sinkEntry Deflate source entrySelector)
  ```

  To add contents from a file, use `loadEntry`:

  ```haskell
  λ> let toSelector = const (mkEntrySelector "my-entry.txt")
  λ> createArchive archivePath (loadEntry BZip2 toSelector myFilePath)
  ```

  Finally, you can copy an entry from another archive without re-compression
  (unless you use `recompress`, see below):

  ```haskell
  λ> createArchive archivePath (copyEntry srcArchivePath selector selector)
  ```

  It's often desirable to just pack a directory:

  ```haskell
  λ> createArchive archivePath (packDirRecur Deflate mkEntrySelector dir)
  ```

  It's also possible to:

  * rename an entry with `renameEntry`
  * delete an entry with `deleteEntry`
  * change compression method with `recompress`
  * change comment associated with an entry with `setEntryComment`
  * delete comment with `deleteEntryComment`
  * set modification time with `setModTime`
  * manipulate extra fields with `addExtraField` and `deleteExtraField`
  * check if entry is intact with `checkEntry`
  * undo changes with `undoEntryCanges`, `undoArchiveChanges`, and `undoAll`
  * force changes to be written to file system with `commit`

  This should cover all your needs. Feel free to open an issue if you're
  missing something.
