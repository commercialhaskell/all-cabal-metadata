changelog: ! "zip-archive 0.3.3\n\n  * Remove dependency on old-time (typedrat).\n
  \ * Drop splitBase flag and support for base versions < 3.\n\nzip-archive 0.3.2.5\n\n
  \ * Move 'build-tools: unzip' from library stanza to test stanza.\n    unzip should
  only be required for testing, not for regular\n    builds of the library.\n\nzip-archive
  0.3.2.4\n\n  * Make build-tools stanza conditional on non-windows. Closes #44.\n\nzip-archive
  0.3.2.3\n\n  * Use custom-setup stanza and specify build-tools.  Closes #41.\n\nzip-archive
  0.3.2.2\n\n  * Use createSymbolicLink instead of createFileLink in tests. This allows\n
  \   us to lower the directory lower bound (#40).\n\nzip-archive 0.3.2.1\n\n  * Fixes
  for handling of symbolic links (#39, Tommaso Piazza).\n\n  * Fixes for symbolic
  link tests, and additional tests.\n\nzip-archive 0.3.2\n\n  * Add ZipOption to preserve
  symbolic links (#37, Tommaso Piazza).\n    Add OptPreserveSymbolicLinks constructor
  to ZipOption.  If this option\n    is set, symbolic links will be preserved.  Symbolic
  links are not\n    supported on Windows.\n\n  * Require binary >= 0.6 (#36).\n\n
  \ * Improve exit handling in zip-archive program.\n\nzip-archive 0.3.1.1\n\n  *
  readEntry:  Read file as a strict ByteString.  This avoids\n    problems on Windows,
  where the file handle wasn't being closed.\n  * Added appveyor.yml to do continuous
  testing on Windows.\n  * Test suite: remove need for external zip program (#35).\n
  \   Instead of creating an archive with zip, we now store\n    a small externally
  created zip archive to use for testing.\n\nzip-archive 0.3.1\n\n  * Don't use a
  custom build (#28).\n  * Renamed executable Zip -> zip-archive, added --debug option.\n
  \   The --debug option prints the intermediate Haskell data structure.\n\nzip-archive
  0.3.0.7\n\n  * Fix check for unix file attributes (#34).\n    Previously attributes
  would not always be preserved\n    for files in zip archives.\n\nzip-archive 0.3.0.6\n\n
  \ * Bump bytestring lower bound so toStrict is guaranteed (Benjamin Landers).\n\nzip-archive
  0.3.0.5\n\n  * Fix bug in `OptLocation` handling (EugeneN).  When using\n    `OptLocation
  folder False` (for adding files to an archive into a\n    folder without preserving
  full path hierarchy), original files'\n    names were ignored, resulting in all
  the files getting the same name.\n\nzip-archive 0.3.0.4\n\n  * Fix `toArchive` so
  it doesn't use too much memory when a data\n    data descriptor holds the size (Michael
  Stahl, #29).\n    The size fields in the local file headers may not contain valid
  values,\n    in which case the sizes are stored in a \"data descriptor\" that follows\n
  \   the file data.  Previously handling this case required reading the\n    entire
  archive is a `[Word8]` list.  With this change, `getWordsTilSig`\n    iteratively
  reads chunks as strict ByteStrings and converts them to\n    a lazy ByteString at
  the end.\n\nzip-archive 0.3.0.3\n\n  * Test suite: use withTempDir to create temporary
  directory.\n    This should help fix problems some have encountered with the\n    test
  suite leaving a temporary directory behind.\n\nzip-archive 0.3.0.2\n\n  * Fix test
  suite so it runs on Windows.\n  * Zip executable: get version from cabal `Paths_zip_archive`
  (#27).\n\nzip-archive 0.3.0.1\n\n  * Set `eVersionMadeBy` to 0 (default) in `toEntry`,
  since we are\n    setting external attributes to 0.  See jgm/pandoc#2822.\n    Only
  to `eVersionMadeBy` to UNIX if we actually read file\n    attributes on a UNIX system.\n\nzip-archive
  0.3\n\n  * Support preservation of file modes on Posix (Dan Aloni, #26).\n  * Add
  `eVersionMadeBy` field to `Entry` (API change).\n  * Export `ZipException` (API
  change).\n  * `fromEntry` no longer checks for CRC32 match.  Previously, it issued\n
  \   `error` if the match failed.  CRC32 match is now checked in `writeEntry`\n    instead,
  and a `CRC32Exception` is raised if the checksum doesn't match.\n  * Test suite:
  return nonzero status if there are test failures.\n    Previously we mistakenly
  did this only on 'errors', not failures.\n  * Test suite: don't use -9 with zip
  as it isn't always available.\n  * Use .travis.yml that builds on both stack and
  cabal.\n\nzip-archive 0.2.3.7\n\n  * Declared test suite's dependency on 'zip' using
  custom Setup.lhs (#21,#22).\n\nzip-archive 0.2.3.6\n\n  * Removed hard-coded path
  to zip in test suite (#21).\n  * Removed misplaced build-depends in cabal file.\n\nzip-archive
  0.2.3.5\n\n  * Allow compilation with binary >= 0.5.  Note that toArchiveOrFail\n
  \   is not safe when compiled against binary < 0.7; it will never\n    return a
  Left value, and will raise an error if parsing fails,\n    just like toArchive.
  \ This is documented in the haddocks.\n    This is ugly, but justified by the need
  to have a version\n    of zip-archive that compiles against older versions of binary.\n\nzip-archive
  0.2.3.4\n\n  * Make sure all path comparisons compare normalized paths.\n    So,
  findEntryByPath \"foo\" will find something stored as \"./foo\"\n    in the zip
  container.\n\nzip-archive 0.2.3.3\n\n  * Better normalization of file paths:  \"./foo/bar\"
  and \"foo/./bar\"\n    are now treated the same, for example.  Note that we do not\n
  \   yet treat \"foo/../bar\" and \"bar\" as the same.\n\nzip-archive 0.2.3.2\n\n
  \ * Removed lower bound on directory (>= 1.2), which caused build\n    failures
  with GHC 7.4 and 7.6.\n  * Added travis script for automatic testing on 3 GHC versions.\n\nzip-archive
  0.2.3.1\n\n  * Require binary >= 0.7 and directory >= 1.2.  The newer binary\n    is
  needed to provide toArchiveOrFail.  The other change is\n    mainly for convenience,
  to avoid lots of ugly conditional\n    compilation.\n\nzip-archive 0.2.3\n\n  *
  Export new function `toArchiveOrFail`.  Closes #17.\n  * Set general purpose bit
  flag to use UTF8 in local file header.\n    Otherwise we get a mismatch between
  the flag in the central\n    directory and the flag in the local file header, which
  causes some\n    programs not to be able to extract the files.  Closes #19.\n\nzip-archive
  0.2.2.1\n\n  * Fix a stack overflow in getWordsTillSig (Tristan Ravitch).\n\nzip-archive
  0.2.2\n\n  * Set bit 11 in the file header to ensure other programs\n    recognize
  UTF-8 encoded file names (Tobias Brandt).\n\nzip-archive 0.2.1\n\n  * Added OptLocation,
  to specify the path to which a file\n    is to be added when readEntry is used (Stephen
  McIntosh).\n\n"
