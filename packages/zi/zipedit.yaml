  Building:

  Get the dependencies

      There aren't any!  Isn't that nice?

  Build with Cabal:

      runhaskell Setup configure --prefix=$HOME
      runhaskell Setup build
      runhaskell Setup install --user

  Building Haddock documentation (optional):

      runhaskell Setup haddock

      Once the documentation has been built, you can access it by
      pointing your browser to dist/doc/html/index.html.  It contains
      descriptions of the exported functions, in addition to a few
      examples of the library's use.
