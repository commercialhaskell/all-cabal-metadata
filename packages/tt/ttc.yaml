  # `ttc-haskell` Changelog

  This project follows the [Haskell package versioning policy][PVP], with
  versions in `A.B.C.D` format.  `A` may be incremented arbitrarily for
  non-technical reasons, but [semantic versioning][SemVer] is otherwise
  followed, where `A.B` is the major version, `C` is the minor version, and `D`
  is the patch version.  Initial development uses versions `0.0.0.D`, for which
  every version is considered breaking.

  [PVP]: <https://pvp.haskell.org/>
  [SemVer]: <https://semver.org/>

  The format of this changelog is based on [Keep a Changelog][KaC], with the
  following conventions:

  * Level-two heading `Unreleased` is used to track changes that have not been
    released.
  * Other level-two headings specify the release in `A.B.C.D (YYYY-MM-DD)`
    format, with newer versions above older versions.
  * Level-three headings are used to categorize changes as follows:
      1. Breaking
      2. Non-Breaking
  * Changes are listed in arbitrary order and present tense.

  ## Overview

  TTC, an initialism of _Textual Type Classes_, is a library that provides
  `Render` and `Parse` type classes for conversion between data types and
  textual data types (strings).  Use the `Show` and `Read` type classes for
  debugging/development, and use the `Render` and `Parse` type classes for your
  own purposes.  The library also provides a `Textual` type class for conversion
  between textual data types as well as functions for validating constants at
  compile-time.

  Since a type may have at most one instance of a given type class, special care
  must be taken when defining type class instances in a shared library.  In
  particular, orphan instances should generally *not* be used in shared
  libraries since they prevent users of the libraries from writing their own
  instances.

  `Render` and `Parse` are best used with types that have canonical textual
  representations, such as textual identifiers.  When there is more than one way
  to create a textual representation, such as configurable formatting, using a
  normal function is probably more appropriate.  Such a function can make use of
  the `Textual` type class to support multiple textual data types.

  This overview includes a brief introduction of the library.  The following
  resources are also available:

  * [API documentation][] is viewable on Hackage.
  * A [series of articles][] gives a guided tour of the library.
      1. [Textual Type Class][]
      2. [Render and Parse][]
      3. [Validated Constants][]
      4. [Best Practices][]
  * The [examples][] directory in the GitHub repository contains usage examples.

  ### `Textual`

  The `Textual` type class is used to convert between the following textual data
  types:

  * `String`
  * Strict `Text`
  * Lazy `Text`
  * `Text` `Builder`
  * Strict `ByteString`
  * Lazy `ByteString`
  * `ByteString` `Builder`
  * `ShortByteString`

  This type class has two key features:

  * Type conversion is *not* done through a fixed type (such as `String` or
    `Text`).
  * It has a single type variable, making it easy to write functions that
    accept arguments and/or return values that may be any of the supported
    textual data types.

  For more details, see the [Textual Type Class][] article.

  ### `Render`

  The `Render` type class renders a data type as a `Textual` data type:

  ```haskell
  class Render a where
    render :: Textual t => a -> t
  ```

  It is analogous to the `Show` type class, which can be reserved for
  debugging/development.

  The `render` function returns any of the supported textual data types.  Use
  the textual data type that is most natural in the implementation of `render`
  instances, and return values are converted to other textual data types when
  necessary.  The `Show` and `IsString` type classes are not used, so use of the
  `String` type is not required.

  As a simple example, consider a `Username` type that is implemented as a
  `newtype` over `Text`:

  ```haskell
  module Username (Username) where

  import Control.Monad (unless, when)
  import Data.Char (isAsciiLower)
  import qualified Data.Text as T
  import Data.Text (Text)
  import qualified Data.TTC as TTC

  newtype Username = Username Text
    deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)

  instance TTC.Render Username where
    render (Username t) = TTC.convert t
  ```

  If a username needs to be included in a `String` error message, conversion is
  automatic:

  ```haskell
  putStrLn $ "user not found: " ++ TTC.render uname
  ```

  For more details, see the [Render and Parse][] article.

  ### `Parse`

  The `Parse` type class parses a data type from a `Textual` data type:

  ```haskell
  class Parse a where
    parse :: (Textual t, Textual e) => t -> Either e a
  ```

  It is analogous to the `Read` type class, which can be reserved for
  debugging/development.

  The `parse` function takes any of the supported textual data types as an
  argument.  Use the textual data type that is most natural in the
  implementation of `parse` instances, and arguments are converted from other
  textual data types when necessary.  The `IsString` type class is not used, so
  use of the `String` type is not required.

  Here is an example instance for `Username`, implementing some restrictions:

  ```haskell
  instance TTC.Parse Username where
    parse = TTC.asT $ \t -> first TTC.fromS $ do
      unless (T.all isAsciiLower t) $ Left "username has invalid character(s)"
      let len = T.length t
      when (len < 3) $ Left "username has fewer than 3 characters"
      when (len > 12) $ Left "username has more than 12 characters"
      pure $ Username t
  ```

  If a username needs to be parsed from a `String`, conversion is automatic:

  ```haskell
  case TTC.parse "tcard" :: Either String Username of
    Right uname -> putStrLn $ "valid username: " ++ TTC.render uname
    Left err -> putStrLn $ "invalid username: " ++ err
  ```

  For more details, see the [Render and Parse][] article.

  ### Constant Validation

  TTC provides functions to validate constants at compile-time, using Template
  Haskell.  For example, a `Username` constant can be defined as follows:

  ```haskell
  user :: Username
  user = $$(TTC.valid "tcard")
  ```

  For more details, see the [Validated Constants][] article.

  ## Related Work

  ### Rendering and Parsing

  The [relude](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/relude) library has
  polymorphic versions of `show` and `readEither` in `Relude.String.Conversion`,
  as well as various type classes for converting between string types.  This
  does not encourage using `Show` and `Read` instances with syntactically valid
  Haskell syntax, and it encourages the using of the `String` data type.

  The [rio](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio) library has a `Display`
  type class with a similar goal as `TTC.Render`.  Since the library encourages
  a uniform usage of textual data types, `Display` only provides functions for
  rendering to `Text` and a builder format.  It does not have a type class
  similar to `TTC.Parse`.

  Harry Garrood has an interesting series of blog posts about type classes and
  `Show`:

  * [Down with Show! Part 1: Rules of thumb for when to use a type class](https://harry.garrood.me/blog/down-with-show-part-1/)
  * [Down with Show! Part 2: What's wrong with the Show type class](https://harry.garrood.me/blog/down-with-show-part-2/)
  * [Down with Show! Part 3: A replacement for Show](https://harry.garrood.me/blog/down-with-show-part-3/)

  ### Validating Constants

  The
  [validated-literals](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/validated-literals)
  library has a `Validate` type class that is similar to `TTC.Parse` but
  supports conversion between arbitrary types, not just from textual data types.
  Template Haskell functions are provided to perform validation at compile-time.
  Result types must either have `Lift` instances or equivalent implementations.

  Chris Done posted
  [a gist](https://gist.github.com/chrisdone/809296b769ee36d352ae4f8dbe89a364)
  about implementing statically checked overloaded strings.

  ### String Type Conversion

  There are a number of libraries that simplify conversion between string types.

  The following libraries provide type classes with two type variables.  The
  primary benefit of this approach is that one can add support for any string
  type.  The drawback of this approach is that implementations of `Render` and
  `Parse` using such a type class would have to be done via a fixed type,
  resulting in unnecessary conversion when using other types.

  * [string-conv](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/string-conv)
  * [string-conversions](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/string-conversions)

  The following library provide type classes with a single type variable, but
  conversion is done via a fixed type.

  * [hxt-regex-xmlschema](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hxt-regex-xmlschema)
    has a `StringLike` type class and does conversion via the `String` type
  * [ListLike](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ListLike) has a `StringLike`
    type class and does conversion via the `String` type
  * [monoid-subclasses](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/monoid-subclasses)
    provides a `TextualMonoid` type class that provides an abstract API over
    textual types, using `String` as the underlying type
  * [stringlike](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stringlike) converts via
    the `Text` type
  * [tagsoup](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tagsoup) has a `StringLike`
    type class that provides an abstract API over textual types and a
    `castString` function that converts via the `String` type
  * [text-conversions](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-conversions)
    converts via the `Text` type
  * [textual](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/textual) (deprecated)
    converts via the `String` type

  ### Arbitrary Type Conversion

  There are also a number of libraries that provide type classes for conversion
  between arbitrary types, including string types.

  * [basement](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/basement) provides type
    classes for conversion that may fail as well as conversion that cannot fail
  * [convertible](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/convertible)
  * [witch](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/witch) provides type classes for
    conversion that may fail as well as conversion that cannot fail
