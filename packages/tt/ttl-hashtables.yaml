  # ttl-hashtables
  This library extends fast mutable hashtables so that entries added can be expired after a given TTL (time to live). This TTL can be specified as a default property of the table or on a per entry basis.

  ## How to use this module:

  Import one of the hash table modules from the hashtables package.. i.e. Basic, Cuckoo, etc
  and "wrap" them in a TTLHashTable:

  ```haskell
  import Data.HashTable.ST.Basic as Basic
  type HashTable k v = TTLHashTable Basic.HashTable k v

  foo :: IO (HashTable Int Int)
  foo = do
      -- create a hash table with maximum 2 entries and a default TTL of
      -- 100 mS
      ht <- H.newWithSettings def { H.maxSize = 2, H.defaultTTL = 100 }
      runMaybeT $ do
        H.insert ht 1 1
        H.insert ht 2 2
        H.insert ht 3 3 -- will never get past this point since max size is 2
      return ht

  main :: IO ()
  main = do
    ht <- foo
    v0 <- H.find ht 1
    threadDelay 200000 -- wait 200mS
    v1 <- H.find ht 2
    v2 <- H.find ht 3
    putStrLn $ "V0=" ++ show v0 -- v0 should be found
    putStrLn $ "V1=" ++ show v1 -- v1 won't be found (expired)
    putStrLn $ "V2=" ++ show v2 -- v2 won't be found (never got inserted)
    return ()
  ```

  You can then use the functions in this module with this hashtable type. Note that the
  functions in this module which can fail offer a flexible error handling strategy by virtue of
  working in the context of a 'Failable' monad. So for example, if the function is used directly
  in the IO monad and a failure occurs it would then result in an exception being thrown. However
  if the context supports the possibiliy of failure like a `MaybeT` or `ExceptT`
  transformer, it would then instead return something like `IO Nothing` or `Left NotFound`
  respectively (depending on the actual failure of course).

  None of the functions in this module are thread safe, just as the underlying mutable
  hash tables in the ST monad aren't as well. If concurrent threads need to operate on the same
  table, you need to provide external means of synchronization to guarantee exclusive access
  to the table
