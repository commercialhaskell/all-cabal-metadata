  on Stackage Nightly](https://www.stackage.org/package/werewolf/badge/nightly)](https://www.stackage.org/nightly/package/werewolf)\n\nA
  game engine for playing werewolf within an arbitrary chat client.\nWerewolf is a
  well known social party game, commonly also called Mafia.\nSee the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game))
  for a rundown on its\n    gameplay and history.\n\nIf you're here just to play werewolf,
  you may wish to skip straight to\n    [chat interfaces](https://github.com/hjwylde/werewolf#chat-interfaces).\n\n###
  Game description\n\nLong has the woods been home to wild creatures, both kind and
  cruel.\nMost have faces and are known to the inhabitants of Fougères in Brittany,
  France; but no-one from\n    the village has yet to lay eyes on the merciless Werewolf.\n\nEach
  night Werewolves attack the village and devour the innocent.\nFor centuries no-one
  knew how to fight this scourge, however recently a theory has taken ahold that\n
  \   mayhaps the Werewolves walk among the Villagers themselves...\n\nObjective of
  the game:  \nFor the Loners: complete their own objective.  \nFor the Villagers:
  lynch all of the Werewolves.  \nFor the Werewolves: devour all of the Villagers.\n\n####
  Roles\n\nThe implemented roles are split into four categories.\n\n**The Ambiguous:**\n\nNo-one
  knows the true nature of the Ambiguous, sometimes not even the Ambiguous themselves!\n\nThe
  Ambiguous are able to change allegiance throughout the game.\n\n* Orphan\n* Village
  Drunk\n\n**The Loners:**\n\nThe Loners look out for themselves and themselves alone.\n\nThe
  Loners must complete their own objective.\n\n* Dullahan\n* Fallen Angel\n* Necromancer
  (and Zombie)\n\n**The Villagers:**\n\nFraught with fear of the unseen enemy, the
  Villagers must work together to determine the truth and\n    eliminate the threat
  to Fougères.\nThe task before them will not be easy, but a certain few have learnt
  some tricks over the years that\n    may turn out rather useful.\n\nThe Villagers
  must lynch all of the Werewolves.\n\n* Beholder\n* Crooked Senator\n* Druid\n* Hunter\n*
  Jester\n* Lycan\n* Medusa\n* Oracle\n* Protector\n* Saint\n* Scapegoat\n* Seer\n*
  Simple Villager\n* Spiteful Villager\n* True Villager\n* Witch\n\n**The Werewolves:**\n\nHiding
  in plain sight, the Werewolves are not a small trifle.\n\nThe Werewolves must devour
  all of the Villagers.\n\n* Alpha Wolf\n* Simple Werewolf\n\n#### Variants\n\nVariants
  alter how the game plays out.\n\n* Standard\n* No role knowledge (players are not
  informed of the roles in play at the start of a game)\n* No role knowledge or reveal
  (players are not informed of the roles in play at the start of a game,\n  nor each
  others roles upon death)\n* No role reveal (players are not informed of each others
  roles upon death)\n* Spiteful village (the default Villager role becomes the Spiteful
  Villager)\n\n### Installing\n\nInstalling werewolf is easiest done using either\n
  \   [stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack) (recommended) or\n    [Cabal](https://github.com/haskell/cabal).\n\n**Using
  stack:**\n\n```bash\nstack install werewolf\nexport PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin\n```\n\n**Using
  Cabal:**\n\n```bash\ncabal-install werewolf\nexport PATH=$PATH:~/.cabal/bin\n```\n\n###
  Usage\n\nThis section covers how a chat interface interacts with the werewolf game
  engine.\n\nAll werewolf commands are designed to be run by a user from the chat
  client.\nE.g., to start a game:\n\n```bash\n> werewolf --caller @foo --tag werewolf
  start --extra-roles seer @bar @baz @qux @quux @corge @grault\n{\"ok\":true,\"messages\":[\n
  \   {\"to\":null,\"message\":\"A new game of werewolf is starting with @foo, @bar,
  @baz, @qux, @quux, @corge and @grault!\"},\n    {\"to\":null,\"message\":\"The roles
  in play are Seer (1), Simple Villager (4) and Simple Werewolf (2) for a total balance
  of -2.\"},\n    {\"to\":\"@foo\",\"message\":\"You're a Simple Villager.\\nA simple,
  ordinary townsperson in every way. Some may be cobblers, others bakers or even nobles.
  No matter their differences though, the plight of Werewolves in Fougères unites
  all the Villagers in this unfortunate time.\\nThe Simple Villager has no special
  abilities, they must use their guile to determine whom among them is not who they
  say they are.\"},\n    ...,\n    {\"to\":null,\"message\":\"Night falls, the village
  is asleep.\"},\n    {\"to\":null,\"message\":\"The Seer wakes up.\"},\n    {\"to\":\"@corge\",\"message\":\"Whose
  allegiance would you like to `see`?\"}\n    ]}\n```\n\nIn this example, user _@foo_
  ran the `start` command with the player names as arguments.\nNote that the calling
  user, _@foo_, was passed in to the `--caller` option and a game tag,\n    _werewolf_,
  was passed in to the `--tag` option.\nAll commands require these options (n.b.,
  the tag option is arbitrary, it just enables multiple\n    games of werewolf to
  be running at once).\n\nAny command ran returns a JSON result.\nThe result contains
  a boolean for whether the command was successful and a list of messages.\nThe `to`
  header on a message may either be `null`---for a public message---or have an intended\n
  \   recipient.\n\nIt's the Seer's turn now.\n\n```bash\n> werewolf --caller @corge
  --tag werewolf see @grault\n{\"ok\":true,\"messages\":[\n    {\"to\":\"@corge\",\"message\":\"@grault
  is aligned with the Werewolves.\"},\n    {\"to\":\"@quux\",\"message\":\"You feel
  restless, like an old curse is keeping you from sleep. It seems you're not the only
  one... @grault is also emerging from their home.\"},\n    {\"to\":\"@grault\",\"message\":\"You
  feel restless, like an old curse is keeping you from sleep. It seems you're not
  the only one... @quux is also emerging from their home.\"},\n    {\"to\":null,\"message\":\"The
  Werewolves wake up, transform and choose a new victim.\"},\n    {\"to\":\"@quux\",\"message\":\"Whom
  would you like to `vote` to devour?\"},\n    {\"to\":\"@grault\",\"message\":\"Whom
  would you like to `vote` to devour?\"}\n    ]}\n```\n\nLet's have the Werewolves,
  _@quux_ and _@grault_, vote to devour a Villager.\n\n```bash\n> werewolf --caller
  @quux --tag werewolf vote @foo\n{\"ok\":true,\"messages\":[\n    {\"to\":\"@grault\",\"message\":\"@quux
  voted to devour @foo.\"}\n    ]}\n> werewolf --caller @grault --tag werewolf vote
  @foo\n{\"ok\":true,\"messages\":[\n    {\"to\":\"@quux\",\"message\":\"@grault voted
  to devour @foo.\"},\n    {\"to\":null,\"message\":\"The sun rises. Everybody wakes
  up and opens their eyes...\"},\n    {\"to\":null,\"message\":\"As you open them
  you notice a door broken down and @foo's guts half devoured and spilling out over
  the cobblestones. From the look of their personal effects, you deduce they were
  a Simple Villager.\"},\n    {\"to\":null,\"message\":\"As the village gathers in
  the square the Town Clerk calls for a vote.\"},\n    {\"to\":null,\"message\":\"Whom
  would you like to `vote` to lynch?\"}\n    ]}\n```\n\nToo bad for _@foo_. Maybe
  the village can get some vengeance...\n\n```bash\n> werewolf --caller @corge --tag
  werewolf vote @grault\n{\"ok\":true,\"messages\":[]}\n```\n\nThis time, even though
  the command was successful, there are no messages.\n\n```bash\n> werewolf --caller
  @corge --tag werewolf vote @grault\n{\"ok\":false,\"messages\":[{\"to\":\"@corge\",\"message\":\"You've
  already voted!\"}]}\n```\n\nHere the command was unsuccessful and an error message
  is sent to _@corge_.\nEven though the command was unsuccessful, the chat interface
  probably won't need to do anything\n    special.\nRelaying the error message back
  to the user should suffice.\n\nThus a chat interface must implement the following:\n*
  The ability to call werewolf commands. This includes passing the `--caller` and
  `--tag` options\n  and arguments correctly. It is possible to only implement the
  `interpret` command, which\n  interprets the caller's input.\n* The ability to send
  resultant messages. Resultant messages may be to everyone or to a specific\n  user.\n\n####

  instructions on how to run a chat interface and play werewolf.\n\n* [Slack](https://github.com/hjwylde/werewolf-slack)\n"
