description: |-
  Utilities to route HTTP requests, mainly focused on path components.  Routes are specified using bijections and invariant functors, allowing run-time composition (routes can be distributed across modules), reverse and forward routing derived from the same specification, and O(log n) lookups.

  There are four steps/components of this package.

  1. Route endpoint specification: "Web.Route.Invertible.Common"

  2. Route map construction: "Web.Route.Invertible.Common"

  3. Route map lookup: "Web.Route.Invertible" (for the generic interface), "Web.Route.Invertible.Wai", "Web.Route.Invertible.Snap", or "Web.Route.Invertible.Happstack"

  4. Reverse routing: "Web.Route.Invertible" or "Web.Route.Invertible.URI"

  Most users will just want to import a framework-specific module like "Web.Route.Invertible.Wai" (or the generic "Web.Route.Invertible"), each of which re-exports "Web.Route.Invertible.Common".
  See test/Main.hs for some examples.
