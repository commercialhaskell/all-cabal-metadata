synopsis: Bindings to the WebDriver API
changelog: "Changelog for webdriver-w3c\n===========================\n\n0.0.2\n-----\n\nThis
  version introduces significant changes to the API, prompted by changes in the `script-monad`
  dependency. The main change is that `WebDriver` and `WebDriverT` have been replaced
  by `WebDriverT` and `WebDriverTT` and are a more sensible monad transformer and
  monad transformer transformer, respectively. The main effect of this is that (1)
  `WebDriver*` types take an extra parameter for the effect monad, and (2) functions
  for working with `WebDriver*` now have additional `Monad` and `MonadTrans` constraints.
  The library will now only compile with GHC >=8.6 due to a transitive dependency
  on `QuantifiedConstraints`.\n\n* Added\n  * Browser preferences field on `FirefoxOptions`
  and `ChromeOptions`\n  * `readDataFile`, `writeDataFile`, `readJsonFile`, and `writeJsonFile`
  data helpers\n  * `breakpoint` and `breakpointWith` for helping with debugging;
  controlled by `breakpointsOn`, and `breakpointsOff`\n  * `expectIs`\n* Changed\n
  \ * Switched order of arguments for `elementSendKeys`, `getElementAttribute`, `getElementProperty`,
  and `getElementCssValue`. The element reference now comes last to make it easier
  to chain these with `>>=`.\n  * `logDebug` and `logNotice`\n  * Tested on geckodriver
  0.23.0.\n* Fixed\n  * Bug in behavior of `cleanupOnError` was causing it to miss
  some errors, which left the remote end session open\n\n\n\n0.0.1\n-----\n\n* Added\n
  \   * `WebDriver` monad for remotely controlling user agents. Also comes in monad
  transformer flavor with `WebDriverT` \n    * Bindings for all [WebDriver endpoints](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html)
  as of 2018-04-20\n    * Integration with the [Tasty](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty)
  test framework\n"

  webdriver-w3c
  =============

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nbloomf/webdriver-w3c.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nbloomf/webdriver-w3c)

  Haskell bindings for the W3C WebDriver API


  What is it?
  -----------

  `webdriver-w3c` is a Haskell library providing bindings to the WebDriver API, enabling us to write Haskell programs that control web browsers. It is actively tested against `geckodriver` and `chromedriver`, as well as a fake remote end implementation. It is implemented as a monad transformer.

  Also included is an integration with the [tasty](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty) test framework.

  [WebDriver](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/) is an HTTP API for interacting with a web browser remotely. It is on track to become a W3C specification and based on work done by the [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/) community.


  Who is it for?
  --------------

  If you:

  * Are interested in browser automation, especially for testing,
  * Want to write browser automation code in Haskell, and
  * Don't mind filing bug and feature requests,

  then you might give `webdriver-w3c` a try.

  This library is unrelated to [webdriver](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/webdriver) except in spirit. That library is older and more mature, and depending on your needs may be more appropriate.


  Where is the documentation?
  ---------------------------

  Depends on what you want!

  * _A cursory glance:_ This brief [tutorial](https://github.com/nbloomf/webdriver-w3c/blob/master/doc/Tutorial.md) shows how to go from nothing to one very simple test.
  * _To start a simple project:_ If you want to write a test suite, there's a separate tutorial on using the [tasty integration](https://github.com/nbloomf/webdriver-w3c/blob/master/doc/TastyDemo.md).
  * _To dig into the API:_ The API docs are on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/webdriver-w3c).
  * _To mess with the library code:_ There's a very small amount of [developer documentation](https://github.com/nbloomf/webdriver-w3c/blob/master/dev/doc.md); I'm also happy to answer questions.


  Who is responsible for this?
