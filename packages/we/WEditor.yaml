  # Revision history for WEditor

  ## 0.2.1.0  -- 2020-04-20

  * **[new]** Fixes an issue with hyphenating words that already have hyphens by
    adding `endsWithHyphen` to `WordSplitter`.

  ## 0.2.0.0  -- 2020-04-17

  * **[breaking]** Adds line-splitting to `FixedFontParser` requirements. This
    ensures that a custom parser that formats the front of the line (e.g., adding
    block indentation) works properly when paragraph breaks are inserted. This
    does not affect compilation or behavior of code that isn't using custom
    line-wrapping policies.

  * **[breaking]** Adds vertical shifting of the viewable text area. This only
    affects compilation of custom `FixedFontViewer`, and otherwise extends the
    available functionality of existing code.

  ## 0.1.0.0  -- 2020-04-14

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

description: |-
  This package contains interfaces and implementations of text-editing idioms
  that can be wired up to UI libraries to create text-editor widgets.

  The goal is to provide:

  * Automatic management of a dynamically-sized viewable area, with preservation
  of the cursor position and minimal view disruption during resizing.
  * Customizable line-wrapping policies and word-hyphenation policies.
  * Support for user-defined character types.

  Also see @<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/WEditorHyphen WEditorHyphen>@
  for language-specific hyphenation rules.
