description: "# webdriver-wrapper\n\nThis package was created so end-users don't need
  to manually manage Selenium or their webdriver when dealing with the [webdriver](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/webdriver)
  package. For now, only `geckodriver` (aka Firefox) is supported - but `chromedriver`
  should be easy to implement. If you can't use Firefox for whichever reason, let
  me know and I'll look into implementing `chromedriver` support. \n\nThis package
  is strongly inspired by [sandwich-webdriver](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sandwich-webdriver).
  My original use-case didn't require the sandwich test suite, though, so I made this
  package which intends on being simpler and more minimalistic. \n\n## Extra dependencies\nYou
  must have Java installed, since Selenium is distributed as a `.jar` file. I'm running
  OpenJDK 17 on my machine, and it works perfectly with the selected Selenium version.
  \n\n## How to use\nThere are two functions which are \"batteries-included\": `wrappedRunSession`
  and `wrappedRunWD`. Just use them as you would `runSession` and `runWD`. The wrapped
  functions will handle downloading Selenium and geckodriver (if they were not already
  downloaded), plus starting and stopping Selenium. If you already have some code
  with `runSession` or `runWD`, their wrapped counterparts are drop-in replacements. "
