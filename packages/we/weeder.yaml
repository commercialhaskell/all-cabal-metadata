  # Weeder

  Weeder is an application to perform whole-program dead-code analysis. Dead code
  is code that is written, but never reachable from any other code. Over the
  lifetime of a project, this happens as code is added and removed, and leftover
  code is never cleaned up. While GHC has warnings to detect dead code is a single
  module, these warnings don't extend across module boundaries - this is where
  Weeder comes in.

  Weeder uses HIE files produced by GHC - these files can be thought of as source
  code that has been enhanced by GHC, adding full symbol resolution and type
  information. Weeder builds a dependency graph from these files to understand how
  code interacts. Once all analysis is done, Weeder performs a traversal of this
  graph from a set of roots (e.g., your `main` function), and determines which
  code is reachable and which code is dead.

  # Using Weeder

  ## Preparing Your Code for Weeder

  To use Weeder, you will need to generate `.hie` files from your source code. If
  you use Cabal, this is easily done by adding one line to your
  `cabal.project.local` file:

  ``` cabal
  package *
    ghc-options: -fwrite-ide-info
  ```

  Once this has been added, perform a full rebuild of your project:

  ``` shell
  cabal clean
  cabal build all
  ```

  ## Calling Weeder

  To call Weeder, you first need to provide a configuration file. Weeder uses
  [Dhall](https://dhall-lang.org) as its configuration format, and configuration
  files have the type:

  ``` dhall
  { roots : List Text, type-class-roots : Bool }
  ```

  `roots` is a list of regular expressions of symbols that are considered as
  alive. If you're building an executable, the pattern `^Main.main$` is a
  good starting point - specifying that `main` is a root.

  `type-class-roots` configures whether or not Weeder should consider anything in
  a type class instance as a root. Weeder is currently unable to add dependency
  edges into type class instances, and without this flag may produce false
  positives. It's recommended to initially set this to `True`:

  ``` dhall
  { roots = [ "^Main.main$" ], type-class-roots = True }
  ```

  Now invoke the `weeder` executable, and - if your project has weeds - you will
  see something like the following:

  ``` shell
  $ weeder

  src/Dhall/TH.hs:187:1: error: toDeclaration is unused

       185 ┃     -> HaskellType (Expr s a)
       186 ┃     -> Q Dec
       187 ┃ toDeclaration haskellTypes MultipleConstructors{..} = do
       188 ┃     case code of
       189 ┃         Union kts -> do

      Delete this definition or add ‘Dhall.TH.toDeclaration’ as a root to fix this error.


  src/Dhall/TH.hs:106:1: error: toNestedHaskellType is unused

       104 ┃     -- ^ Dhall expression to convert to a simple Haskell type
       105 ┃     -> Q Type
       106 ┃ toNestedHaskellType haskellTypes = loop
       107 ┃   where
       108 ┃     loop dhallType = case dhallType of

      Delete this definition or add ‘Dhall.TH.toNestedHaskellType’ as a root to fix this error.
  ```

  (Please note these warnings are just for demonstration and not necessarily weeds
  in the Dhall project).

  # Limitations

  Weeder currently has a few limitations:

  ## Type Class Instances

  Weeder is not currently able to analyse whether a type class instance is used.
  For this reason, Weeder adds all symbols referenced to from a type class
  instance to the root set, keeping this code alive. In short, this means Weeder
  might not detect dead code if it's used from a type class instance which is
  never actually needed.

  You can toggle whether Weeder consider type class instances as roots with the
  `type-class-roots` configuration option.

  ## Template Haskell

  Weeder is currently unable to parse the result of a Template Haskell splice. If
  some Template Haskell code refers to other source code, this dependency won't be
  tracked by Weeder, and thus Weeder might end up with false positives.
