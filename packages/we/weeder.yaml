  [![Stackage version](https://www.stackage.org/package/weeder/badge/nightly?label=Stackage)](https://www.stackage.org/package/weeder)
  [![Linux Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/ndmitchell/weeder/master.svg?label=Linux%20build)](https://travis-ci.org/ndmitchell/weeder)
  [![Windows Build Status](https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/ndmitchell/weeder/master.svg?label=Windows%20build)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ndmitchell/weeder)\n\nMost
  projects accumulate code over time. Weeder detects unused Haskell exports, allowing
  dead code to be removed (pulling up the weeds). Weeder piggy-backs off files generated
  by [`stack`](https://www.haskellstack.org), so first obtain stack, then:\n\n* Install
  `weeder` by running `stack install weeder --resolver=nightly`.\n* Ensure your project
  has a `stack.yaml` file. If you don't normally build with `stack` then run `stack
  init` to generate one.\n* Run `weeder . --build`, which builds your project with
  `stack` and reports any weeds.\n\n## What does Weeder detect?\n\nWeeder detects
  a bunch of weeds, including:\n\n* You export a function `helper` from module `Foo.Bar`,
  but nothing else in your package uses `helper`, and `Foo.Bar` is not an `exposed-module`.
  Therefore, the export of `helper` is a weed. Note that `helper` itself may or may
  not be a weed - once it is no longer exported `-fwarn-unused-binds` will tell you
  if it is entirely redundant.\n* Your package `depends` on another package but doesn't
  use anything from it - the dependency should usually be deleted. This functionality
  is quite like [packunused](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/packunused), but
  implemented quite differently.\n* Your package has entries in the `other-modules`
  field that are either unused (and thus should be deleted), or are missing (and thus
  should be added). The `stack` tool warns about the latter already.\n* A source file
  is used between two different sections in a `.cabal` file - e.g. in both the library
  and the executable. Usually it's better to arrange for the executable to depend
  on the library, but sometimes that would unnecessarily pollute the interface. Useful
  to be aware of, and sometimes worth fixing, but not always.\n* A file has not been
  compiled despite being mentioned in the `.cabal` file. This situation can be because
  the file is unused, or the `stack` compilation was incomplete. I recommend compiling
  both benchmarks and tests to avoid this warning where possible - running `weeder
  . --build` will use a suitable command line.\n\nBeware of conditional compilation
  (e.g. `CPP` and the [Cabal `flag` mechanism](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/developing-packages.html#configurations)),
  as these may mean that something is currently a weed, but in different configurations
  it is not.\n\nI recommend fixing the warnings relating to `other-modules` and files
  not being compiled first, as these may cause other warnings to disappear.\n\n##
  What else should I use?\n\nWeeder detects dead exports, which can be deleted. To
  get the most code deleted from removing an export, use:\n\n* GHC with `-fwarn-unused-binds
  -fwarn-unused-imports`, which finds unused definitions and unused imports in a module.\n*
  [HLint](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint#readme), looking for \"Redundant extension\"
  hints, which finds unused extensions.\n* [Unused](https://github.com/joshuaclayton/unused),
  which works at the level of `ctags` information, so can be used if you don't want
  to use `stack`, can't compile your code, or want to detect unused code between projects.\n\n##
  Ignoring weeds\n\nIf you want your package to be detected as \"weed free\", but
  it has some weeds you know about but don't consider important, you can add a `.weeder.yaml`
  file adjacent to the `stack.yaml` with a list of exclusions. To generate an initial
  list of exclusions run `weeder . --yaml > .weeder.yaml`.\n\nYou may wish to generalise/simplify
  the `.weeder.yaml` by removing anything above or below the interesting part. As
  an example of the [`.weeder.yaml` file from `ghcid`](https://github.com/ndmitchell/ghcid/blob/master/.weeder.yaml):\n\n```yaml\n-
  message: Module reused between components\n- message:\n  - name: Weeds exported\n
  \ - identifier: withWaiterPoll\n```\n\nThis configuration declares that I am not
  interested in the message about modules being reused between components (that's
  the way `ghcid` works, and I am aware of it). It also says that I am not concerned
  about `withWaiterPoll` being a weed - it's a simplified method of file change detection
  I use for debugging, so even though it's dead now, I sometimes do switch to it.\n\n##
  Running with Continuous Integration\n\nBefore running Weeder on your continuous
  integration (CI) server, you should first ensure there are no existing weeds. One
  way to achieve that is to ignore existing hints by running `weeder . --yaml > .weeder.yaml`
  and checking in the resulting `.weeder.yaml`.\n\nOn the CI you should then run `weeder
  .` (or `weeder . --build` to compile as well). To avoid the cost of compilation
  you may wish to fetch the [latest Weeder binary release](https://github.com/ndmitchell/weeder/releases/latest).
  For certain CI environments there are helper scripts to do that.\n\n**Travis:**
  Execute the following command:\n\n    curl -sL https://raw.github.com/ndmitchell/weeder/master/misc/travis.sh
  | sh -s .\n\nThe arguments after `-s` are passed to `weeder`, so modify the final
  `.` if you want other arguments.\n\n**Appveyor:** Add the following statement to
  `.appveyor.yml`:\n\n    - ps: Invoke-Command ([Scriptblock]::Create((Invoke-WebRequest
  'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ndmitchell/weeder/master/misc/appveyor.ps1').Content))
  -ArgumentList @('.')\n\nThe arguments inside `@()` are passed to `weeder`, so add
  new arguments surrounded by `'`, space separated - e.g. `@('.' '--build')`.\n\n##
  What about Cabal users?\n\nWeeder requires the textual `.hi` file for each source
  file in the project. Stack generates that already, so it was easy to integrate in
  to. There's no reason that information couldn't be extracted by either passing flags
  to Cabal, or converting the `.hi` files afterwards. I welcome patches to do that
  integration.\n\n## What about false positives?\n\nWeeder strives to avoid incorrectly
  warning about something that is required, if you find such an instance please report
  it on [the issue tracker](https://github.com/ndmitchell/weeder/issues). Unfortunately
  there are some cases where there are still false positives, as GHC doesn't put enough
  information in the `.hi` files:\n\n**Data.Coerce** If you use `Data.Coerce.coerce`
  the constructors for the data type must be in scope, but if they aren't used anywhere
  other than automatically by `coerce` then Weeder will report unused imports. You
  can ignore such warnings by adding `- message: Unused import` to your `.weeder.yaml`
  file.\n\n**Declaration QuasiQuotes** If you use a declaration-level quasi-quote
  then weeder won't see the use of the quoting function, potentially leading to an
  unused import warning, and marking the quoting function as a weed. The only solution
  is to ignore the entries with a `.weeder.yaml` file.\n\n**Stack extra-deps** Packages
  marked extra-deps in your `stack.yaml` will be weeded, due to a bug in [`stack`](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/3258).
  The only solution is to ignore the packages with a `.weeder.yaml` file.\n"
