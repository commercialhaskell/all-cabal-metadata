  [![Windows Build Status](https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/ndmitchell/weeder.svg?label=Windows%20build)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ndmitchell/weeder)\n\nThe
  principle is to delete dead code (pulling up the weeds). To do that, run:\n\n* GHC
  with `-fwarn-unused-binds -fwarn-unused-imports`, which finds unused definitions
  and unused imports in a module.\n* [HLint](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint#readme),
  looking for \"Redundant extension\" hints, which finds unused extensions.\n* The
  `weeder` tool, which detects functions that are exported internally but not available
  from outside this package. It also detects redundancies and missing information
  in your `.cabal` file.\n\n## Running Weeder\n\nTo use `weeder` your code must have
  been built with [`stack`](https://www.haskellstack.org), as it piggy-backs off files
  that `stack` generates. If you don't normally build with `stack` a simple `stack
  init && weeder . --build` is likely to be sufficient to get you started.\n\n## What
  does Weeder detect?\n\nWeeder detects a bunch of weeds, including:\n\n* You export
  a function `helper` from module `Foo.Bar`, but nothing else in your package uses
  `helper`, and `Foo.Bar` is not an `exposed-module`. Therefore, the export of `helper`
  is a weed. Note that `helper` itself may or may not be a weed - once it is no longer
  exported `-fwarn-unused-binds` will tell you if it is entirely redundant.\n* Your
  package `depends` on another package but doesn't use anything from it - the dependency
  should usually be deleted. This functionality is quite like [packunused](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/packunused),
  but implemented quite differently.\n* Your package has entries in the `other-modules`
  field that are either unused (and thus should be deleted), or are missing (and thus
  should be added). The `stack` tool warns about the latter already.\n* A source file
  is used between two different sections in a `.cabal` file - e.g. in both the library
  and the executable. Usually it's better to arrange for the executable to depend
  on the library, but sometimes that would unnecessarily pollute the interface. Useful
  to be aware of, and sometimes worth fixing, but not always.\n* A file has not been
  compiled despite being mentioned in the `.cabal` file. This situation can be because
  the file is unused, or the `stack` compilation was incomplete. I recommend compiling
  both benchmarks and tests to avoid this warning where possible - running `weeder
  . --build` will use a suitable command line.\n\nBeware of conditional compilation
  (e.g. `CPP` and the [Cabal `flag` mechanism](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/developing-packages.html#configurations)),
  as these may mean that something is currently a weed, but in different configurations
  it is not.\n\nI recommend fixing the warnings relating to `other-modules` and files
  not being compiled first, as these may cause other warnings to disappear.\n\n##
  Ignoring weeds\n\nIf you want your package to be detected as \"weed free\", but
  it has some weeds you know about but don't consider important, you can add a `.weeder.yaml`
  file adjacent to the `stack.yaml` with a list of exclusions. To generate an initial
  list of exclusions run `weeder . --yaml > .weeder.yaml`.\n\nYou may then with to
  generalise/simplify the `.weeder.yaml` by removing anything above or below the interesting
  part. As an example of the [`.weeder.yaml` file from `ghcid`](https://github.com/ndmitchell/ghcid/blob/master/.weeder.yaml):\n\n```yaml\n-
  message: Module reused between components\n- message:\n  - name: Weeds exported\n
  \ - identifier: withWaiterPoll\n```\n\nThis configuration declares that I am not
  interested in the message about modules being reused between components (that's
  the way `ghcid` works, and I am aware of it). It also says that I am not concerned
  about `withWaiterPoll` being a weed - it's a simplified method of file change detection
  I use for debugging, so even though it's dead now, I sometimes do switch to it.\n"
