changelog: |
  ### 1.4.1.2

  * [Kludgy](https://github.com/LinuxUser404) bumped dep versions and resolver.
  * [LinuxUser404](https://github.com/LinuxUser404) bumped dep versions and added `cabal.project` & `.travis.yml`.
  * Set up travis builds with stack.

  ### 1.4.1.1

  * Split changelog to own file (before this, it's located in README.md).
  * [lambdael](https://github.com/lambdael) added `glfwGetWindowSize`.
  * [Bump upper bound on `base` dependency](https://github.com/fpco/stackage/issues/2670). Bump stack LTS.

  ### 1.4.1

  * Split `Wrapped` module to `Window` and `Misc` modules.
  * Don't expose `ErrorCallback`, do expose  the `Error` type for custom error callbacks.
  * Switch from ad-hoc parenting for shared contexts, to the "ancestor" pattern described in [#24](https://github.com/plredmond/GPipe-GLFW/issues/24#issuecomment-299681824).
  * Adjustments to debug logging format.
  * Add smoketest for window close functions & sequential GPipe windows.
  * Bump deps to `GPipe-2.2.1`

  ### 1.4.0

  * Rewrite for new window handling interface.
  * Separate smoke tests to own package.

  ### 1.3.0

  * Overhaul `Graphics.GPipe.Context.GLFW.Input` to expose most of the functionality in [GLFW Input guide](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/input_guide.html).

  ### 1.2.3

  * [SwiftsNamesake](https://github.com/SwiftsNamesake) bumped version constraints.
  * Add a smoke test and stubs for shared-context tests.

  ### 1.2.2

  * [grtlr](https://github.com/grtlr) added scroll callback registration.
  * Add a readme to be a good citizen and update documentation.

  ### 1.2.1

  * [bch29](https://github.com/bch29) refactored and added new GLFW input callback registration functions as well as the `unsafe` module to access the GLFW window directly.

  ### 1.2

  * [bch29](https://github.com/bch29) exposed more of the underlying GLFW hints.
