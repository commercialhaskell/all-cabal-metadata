changelog: "### 2.2.4\r\n\r\n- Support for GHC 8.6.5 (#63)\r\n\r\n### 2.2.3\r\n\r\n-
  Removing an unnecessary optimization that was broken since 2.2\r\n\r\n### 2.2.2\r\n\r\n-
  Support for GHC 8.2.1 (#52)\r\n- Fixing errors with hidden contexts\r\n- Fixing
  GLSL link error on subtracting a negative constant (#55)\r\n- Fixing GLSL ambiguous
  overload with \"clamp\" (#51)\r\n- Adding atan2' (#44)\r\n\r\n### 2.2.1\r\n\r\n-
  Render monad would crash if using deleted windows, when that should be a no-op.
  (#41).\r\n- Manually deleting last visible window causes objects to be deleted (#42).\r\n\r\n###
  2.2\r\n\r\n- Windows are now explicit objects dynamically created and deleted with
  newWindow and deleteWindow, and are sent as parameter to drawWindowColor et al.
  (#18)\r\n- Each window created can now take their own window manager specific parameters
  (#19)\r\n- Update to GHC 8.0.2 and gl-0.8.0 (#38)\r\n\r\n### 2.1.8\r\n\r\n- Update
  dependencies to make it build with stack resolver nightly-2016-09-24\r\n\r\n###
  2.1.7\r\n\r\n- Runtime optimizations (Use BaseVertex for glDraw* instead of offsetting
  each attribute)\r\n\r\n### 2.1.6\r\n\r\n- Adding support for normal Floats, Int32s
  and Word32s in PrimitiveStreams\r\n- Runtime optimizations\r\n\r\n### 2.1.5\r\n\r\n-
  Fixed bug in clear where masks weren't set\r\n- Added up to 7-tuple instances\r\n\r\n###
  2.1.4\r\n\r\n- Fixed bug in dropVertices and dropIndices (#16)\r\n- Added withPointSize
  (#15)\r\n\r\n### 2.1.3\r\n\r\n- Fixed bug in clearImage\r\n\r\n### 2.1.2\r\n\r\n-
  Fixed bug when nesting while, ifThen, ifThenElse or ifThenElse'.\r\n\r\n### 2.1.1\r\n\r\n-
  Made ifB use ifThenElse' instead to avoid unwanted strictness\r\n- Fixed bug where
  ShaderBaseType for () wasn't lazy enough, causing error in ifThenElse'\r\n- Added
  missing () instances\r\n\r\n### 2.1\r\n\r\n- Making dangling finalizers work with
  shared and unshared contexts (#10)\r\n- Moved orphan instances to separate module
  (#11)\r\n- Fixing a bug introduced in 2.0.2 when using multiple uniforms\r\n- Fixing
  exception when using conditionals in the shader (#12)\r\n\r\n### 2.0.2\r\n\r\n-
  Linear bumped to 1.20\r\n- Running contextSwap and contextFrameBufferSize on right
  thread (#7)\r\n- render now throws if rendering to an image from a texture thats
  used for sampling (#8)\r\n- Added GPipe class instances for all linear types (#9)\r\n\r\n###
  2.0.1\r\n\r\n- Fixed runtime error in simple fragment program when not all uniforms
  where used (#5)\r\n\r\n### 2.0\r\n\r\n- Initial release of GPipe 2\r\n"

description: |-
  A typesafe API based on the conceptual model of OpenGl, but without the imperative state machine.
  Aims to be as close to the raw OpenGl performance as possible, without compromising type safety or functional style.
  Includes DSL for shaders to provide type safety even when crossing into that domain.
  Uses OpenGl 3.3 core profile under the hood.
