                  gpcsets: Pitch Class Sets for Haskell
                             Bruce H. McCosar


    *News* Version 0.9.2.0 introduces Data.PcSets.Compact, which
    allows a PcSet to be translated to and from "Compact Format"
    (one alphanumeric character per pitch class element).


  This is the third release for my General Pitch Class Sets library. It's
  still being built. Right now I have 3 out of 5 modules completed. However,
  the one module that's most complete is the main module, and it has been
  subjected to an enormous amount of test code.

  Places to find out more information
  ===================================

    * http://code.google.com/p/pcsets/

      Pitch Class Sets for Python. The original. Only handles 12-TET. I've
      got links to online Pitch Class Set references there, in case you're
      new to all this.

    * http://bmccosar.wordpress.com/

      My Wordpress Music blog. Until I get the gpcsets library in final form,
      this is the spot to find out information about upcoming releases and
      current work on this project.

  Features of this Package
  ========================

    * Data.PcSets is complete. It's fully documented through Literate Haskell
      AND through Haddock.

    * There's an enormous test suite for the main module in
      test/Test/PcSets.lhs

    * Data.PcSets.Svg is complete, and can produce a limited range of svg
      illustrations for pitch class sets.

    * Data.PcSets.Compact is complete, and allows translations to and from
      "Compact Format" (one alphanumeric character per pitch class element,
      eg [0,4,7,11] as "047B").

    * Future modules are planned: Notes, for standard representations of
      pitch class sets (eg "C E G B" instead of [0,4,7,11]); and Catalog
      for calculating prime set catalogs in different modulus systems.

    * The skeletons of the other modules and test suites are there. Most of
      the code is written, and just needs ported from my earlier versions
      (which didn't use the Haskell class system) to the modern version.

  Release Schedule
  ================

  This is still a work in progress. I released the first version as 0.9.0.x.
  Each module I add thereafter will increase the third number by one, eg
  0.9.1.x. Therefore, if I finish four new modules and four new test suites,
  I should end up at 0.9.8.x. When all of the smoke clears and the entire
  library has been tested, tested, and retested, I'll call it "stable" and
  put it out there as 1.0.0.
