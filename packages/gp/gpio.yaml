  Haskell GPIO interface, designed specifically for the RaspberryPi.

  This library also ships with an executable for directly running gpio commands. Note: when using the executable there are less guarantees about the current state of a pin. For example, when using the library we can be sure that an `ActivePin 'Out` has already been initialized and configured for writing values, when using the executable we are less sure, and therefore errors might occur.


  Note: this package has limited functionality, might be buggy and is not optimized. It works for simple read/write operations on a few pre-defined pins, but still needs a lot more testing.

  TODO:
    * Remove `runLineHack` when reading GPIO value files.
    * Optimize file reading to only look at first char.
    * Support other pin modes (in/out/up/down/pwm)
    * Support edges
    * Look into GPIO supported file watching
    * Add all pin numbers
