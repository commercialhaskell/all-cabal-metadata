  # Version 0.3

  * BREAKING CHANGE: Pretty much everything is the library was changed, in
    order for the library to become a bit lower level, and to support
    CSRF protection.


  # Version 0.2

  * BREAKING CHANGE: The type of `set` changed so that `set cc Nothing` is
    now `delete cc` (new function), and `set cc (Just a)` is now
    `set cc a`.

  * Added a function `keep` to keep the cookie as is on the client side,
    without sending any `Set-Cookie` header on the reply.

  * The `CryptoCookie` won't be decrypted and decoded until `get` is used.
    This makes requests that don't need to interact with the
    `CryptoCookie` more efficient.

  * Documentation improvements.

  * Test improvements.


  # Version 0.1

  * Changed the type of `middleware` so that the previous *lookup*
    function is not used anymore. Instead, a `CryptoCookie` is
    provided directly to an `Application`-construction function.


  # Version 0.0.1

  * Initial version.
