description: |-
  This package allows 'IO' based monads in covariant and contravariant positions
  of <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai wai> 'Application's.

  The monads, which are applicable for this, need to have
  'MonadUnliftIO' instances.
  This are for most cases 'ReaderT' stacks based on the 'IO' monad.
  This package will especially be of interest, if you are sharing access to
  'MVar's, 'TVar's or other concurrent data, while controlling that access with
  monad transformers.

  This package is based on
  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai-transformers wai-transformers> by Athan
  Clark.
