description: "This program batch-converts .wav files to .ogg format while filling
  in the ID3\ntags for the resulting .ogg files using directory structure information.
  \n\n=== Installation ===\n\n$ runhaskell Setup.lhs configure\n$ runhaskell Setup.lhs
  build\n$ runhaskell Setup.lhs install\n\nTested with GHC 6.8.2.\n\nYou will need
  the \"oggenc\" program (part of the vorbis-tools package) to run\nwavconvert. It
  would be easy to change the source code so that the program \nname to use (and appropriate
  flags) are specified on the command line or\n(preferably) through a configure option.
  Send me a patch if you do!\n\n=== Usage ===\n\n./wavconvert [OPTION...] root-directory\n\n(where
  options are described below).\n\nwavconvert assumes that files in the root directory
  are named with the following\nconvention:\n\nroot-directory/ArtistName/AlbumName/TrackNum
  - SongTitle.wav\n\nFor example, if root-directory is \"/home/tjc/Music\", an example
  is:\n\n/home/tjc/Music/Morrissey/Vauxhall and I/10 - The Lazy Sunbathers.wav\n\nIt
  looks for .wav files underneath the root directory and encodes any such files\nit
  finds in .ogg, relying on the naming conventions described above. The output\nfile
  name is determined by substituting the \".wav\" extension in the original \nfilename
  with \".ogg\".\n\nIt does not delete the original .wav file unless you specify the
  --remove-files\noption.\n\nIf the .ogg file that would have been created already
  exists, it skips that file\nand prints a warning.\n\n==== Command-line options ====\n\n-v
  / --verbose prints out external commands as they are executed.\n-d / --dry-run prints
  out commands without executing them.\n-r / --remove-files removes .WAV files after
  all files are encoded.\n\n=== To do ===\n\n* Take the name of the program and relevant
  flags as configure or command-line\noptions, rather than hard-wiring in oggenc or
  its flags.\n* Don't assume a particular file naming convention, but rather take
  a format\nstring as an argument and interpret the directory structure based on that
  string.\n\nFeel free to send me patches if you decide to implement these changes
  or\nanything else!\n\n   -- Tim Chevalier <chevalier@alum.wellesley.edu>\n      August
