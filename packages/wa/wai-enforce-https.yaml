  </div>

  [Wai](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai) middleware enforcing HTTPS protocol on any incoming request.
  In case of non-encrypted HTTP, traffic is redirected using `301 Permanent Redirect`
  or optionally `307 Temporary Redirect`.

  Middleware has compatibility modes for various reverse proxies (load balancers) and therefore can be used
  with Heroku, Google Cloud (Ingress), Azure or any other type of PAS or Cloud provider.

  ## Comparison with ForceSSL

  [Wai-Extra](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai-extra-3.0.24.3/docs/Network-Wai-Middleware-ForceSSL.html)
  package comes with `Network.Wai.Middleware.ForceSSL` module exposing middleware intended for the same purpose.
  There are several practical weaknesses of this implementation compare to one provided by wai-enforce-https.

  | Behavior                        | EnforceHTTPS (wai-enforce-https)    | ForceSSL (wai-extra) |
  |---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|
  | Redirecting methods by default  | `GET`, `HEAD` (by default)          | All                  |
  | Redirect status                 | `301` (default) or `307` (optional) | `307`                |
  | Safe against header spoofing    | ✔ yes                               | ❌ no                |
  | Forwarded spec compliant        | ✔ yes                               | ❌ no                |
  | Configurable port               | ✔ yes                               | ❌ no                |
  | Configurable host               | ✔ yes                               | ❌ no                |
  | 405 with `Allow` header support | ✔ yes                               | ❌ no                |

  Overall, this package aims to be **secure by default** and **configurable** as much as possible
  to fit any specific needs.

  ## Forwarded

  In addition to the main functionality (enforcement of HTTPS) this package also
  comes with module for parsing and encoding [Forwarded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Forwarded)
  HTTP header.

  ## Examples

  This example is using [warp-tls](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/warp-tls)
  and runs 2 servers:

  - HTTP server on port 8080
  - HTTPS server on port 8443

  if you open http://127.0.0.1:8080 in browser server returns redirect
  to https://127.0.0.1:8443

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

  module Main where

  import           Control.Concurrent                  (forkIO)
  import           Network.HTTP.Types                  (status200)
  import           Network.Wai                         (Application, responseLBS)
  import           Network.Wai.Handler.Warp            (defaultSettings, run,
                                                        setPort)
  import           Network.Wai.Handler.WarpTLS         (runTLS, tlsSettings)
  import           Network.Wai.Middleware.EnforceHTTPS (EnforceHTTPSConfig (..))

  import qualified Network.Wai.Middleware.EnforceHTTPS as EnforceHTTPS

  handler :: Application
  handler _ respond =
     respond $ responseLBS status200 [] "Hello over HTTPS"

  httpsConf :: EnforceHTTPSConfig
  httpsConf = EnforceHTTPS.defaultConfig { httpsPort = 8443 }

  app :: Application
  app = EnforceHTTPS.withConfig httpsConf handler

  main :: IO ()
  main = do
    let tls = tlsSettings "examples/cert.pem" "examples/key.pem"
    _ <- forkIO $ run 8080 app
    runTLS tls (setPort (httpsPort httpsConf) defaultSettings) app
  ```

  Another common example is running server behind reverse proxy.
  Say for instance we want to host our app on [Heroku](https://heroku.com)
  while using its https support and make sure we
  redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
  Heroku is forwarding traffic with additional header containing
  information about protocol named `x-forwarded-proto`.

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

  module Main where

  import           Network.HTTP.Types                  (status200)
  import           Network.Wai                         (Application, responseLBS)
  import           Network.Wai.Handler.Warp            (runEnv)

  import qualified Network.Wai.Middleware.EnforceHTTPS as EnforceHTTPS

  handler :: Application
  handler _ respond = respond $
    responseLBS status200 [] "Hello from behind proxy"

  app :: Application
  app = EnforceHTTPS.withResolver EnforceHTTPS.xForwardedProto handler

  main :: IO ()
  main = runEnv 8080 app
  ```

  ### Bulding Examples

  In order to run examples project must be build with `examples` flag:

  ```
  $ cabal build -f examples
