  # Revision history for wai-handler-hal

  ## 0.4.0.0 -- 2024-01-17

  - New function: `Wai.Handler.Hal.runWithOptions :: Options ->
    Application -> ProxyRequest NoAuthorizer -> ProxyResponse`. This
    provides a convenient way to pass custom `Options` without all the
    bells and whistles of `runWithContext`.

  - Instead of guessing whether a given response `Content-Type` should
    be sent as text or base64-encoded binary, `Options` now contains a
    `binaryMediaTypes :: [MediaType]`, which lists the media types that
    should be base64-encoded. This should match the `binaryMediaTypes`
    setting you have configured on the API Gateway that integrates with
    your Lambda Function.

    _See:_ [Content type conversion in API
      Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-payload-encodings-workflow.html)
      in the [Amazon API Gateway Developer
      Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/).

  ## 0.3.0.0 -- 2023-12-17

  - Accidental breaking change: more elaborate `Content-Type` headers
    like `Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8` are now encoded
    as if they were binary payloads. This release has been deprecated.
  - Breaking change: add `Options` record parameter to `runWithContext`,
    `toWaiRequest` and `fromWaiResponse`.
  - Provide a `defaultOptions`.
  - Make whether or not to run base64-encoding on the response body customizable
    through `Options.binaryMimeType`.

  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2023-03-17

  - Breaking change: `toWaiRequest` now sorts request headers and query string
    parameters.

  ## 0.1.2.0 -- 2022-06-03

  - Fix construction of `rawPathInfo`.

  ## 0.1.1.0 -- 2021-10-14

  - When API Gateway sends nonsense IPs during a test invocation, sub in
    `127.0.0.1` instead of exploding.
    [#3](https://github.com/bellroy/wai-handler-hal/issues/3)
  - Removed debug `print`s left in by mistake.

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2021-04-15

  - First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  # wai-handler-hal

  [![Haskell-CI](https://github.com/bellroy/wai-handler-hal/actions/workflows/haskell-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bellroy/wai-handler-hal/actions/workflows/haskell-ci.yml)

  This library lets you run `wai` `Application`s on AWS Lambda, which
  means you can now use mature web frameworks like
  [`servant`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant).

  The main entry point is `Network.Wai.Handler.Hal.run`, which wraps an
  `Application` and returns a function that can be passed to `hal`'s
  `AWS.Lambda.Runtime.mRuntime`.

  **NOTE:** The function returned by `Network.Wai.Handler.Hal.run` is
  only for [Lambda Proxy
  Integrations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-lambda-proxy-integrations.html)
  of AWS API Gateway **REST APIs** (`AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi` in
  CloudFormation). If you try to use such a Lambda with an API Gateway
  **HTTP API** (`AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Api` in CloudFormation), it will
  return 500s.


  For code examples, see [this repository](https://github.com/bellroy/wai-handler-hal-example),
  which contains:

  * [`wai-handler-hal-example`](https://github.com/bellroy/wai-handler-hal-example): A simple `servant` API set up to run on both `hal` and `warp`; and
  * [`wai-handler-hal-cdk`](https://github.com/bellroy/wai-handler-hal-example/tree/master/wai-handler-hal-cdk): A small [AWS
    CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html)
    application that deploys an API backed by `wai-handler-hal-example`.

  ## Developing

  Instead of serving your application with something like
  [`warp`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/warp), you will set up an
  executable that serves your application with
  [`hal`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hal). The necessary glue
  code looks something like this:

  ```haskell
  import AWS.Lambda.Runtime (mRuntime)
  import Network.Wai (Application)
  import qualified Network.Wai.Handler.Hal as WaiHandler

  app :: Application
  app = undefined -- From Servant or wherever else

  main :: IO ()
  main = mRuntime $ WaiHandler.run app
  ```

  ### Local testing

  Compiled Lambda functions can be awkward to test, especially if you're
  relying on an API Gateway integration to translate HTTP
  requests. Consider defining a second executable target that serves
  your `Application` using `warp`, which you can use for local
  testing.

  ### Caveats

  * The Lambda is never told the port that the API Gateway is listening
    on. Most APIs will listen on `443` (HTTPS), so that's what the
    library reports by default. See `runWithContext` if you need to
    change this.

  * The Lambda is never told the HTTP version that the client uses when
    talking with the API Gateway. We assume HTTP 1.1.

  ## Packaging

  Lambda functions are packaged in one of two ways: as `.zip` files or
  as Docker container images. The [`wai-handler-hal-cdk` example](https://github.com/bellroy/wai-handler-hal-example/tree/master/wai-handler-hal-cdk) uses
  `.zip` files for simplicity. CDK doesn't give us an easy way to build
  container images using `nix build`, so a container-based deployment
  using CDK would need to push to ECR first and then reference the image
  by name.

  ### `.zip` files

  You will need to create a `.zip` file containing ([at
  least](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html#runtimes-custom-build))
  an executable named `bootstrap`. This executable needs to run in
  Amazon's runtime environment, and there are multiple ways to ensure
  this.

  #### Static linking

  IOHK's [`haskell.nix`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell.nix)
  can build static Haskell binaries by cross-compiling against musl
  libc. This is convenient, but consider copyleft implications (of
  `libgmp`; `wai-handler-hal` is BSD-3-Clause) if you are distributing
  the binaries to other people.

  #### Dynamic linking

  The other option is to compile the executable in an environment with
  packages that match the [Lambda runtime
  environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html). Some
  ideas:

  * Build the executable in an "imitation environment" like the [`lambci/lambda`](https://hub.docker.com/r/lambci/lambda) Docker container; or
  * (Untested) build the executable on an Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance.

  ### Docker container images

  It is possible to package Lambdas into Docker containers for
  deployment. Amazon provide base containers for custom runtimes in the
  repository
  [`amazon/aws-lambda-provided`](https://hub.docker.com/r/amazon/aws-lambda-provided/). One
  nice feature of these images is that they provide a [runtime interface
  emulator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-test.html#images-test-AWSbase),
  which they fall back to when not running "for real". This makes it
  possible to directly invoke the lambda and see how it behaves. (This
  is less important here because we can serve our application off
  `warp`, but for writing Lambdas not invoked by an API Gateway Proxy
  Integration, it's handy.)

  At the time of writing (2021-04-06), the
  `amazon/aws-lambda-provided:al2` (Amazon Linux 2 tag) is the newest
  base image that Amazon recommends for custom runtimes. You can use a
  `Dockerfile` to build your images; there are also commented .nix files
  in the [example repository](https://github.com/bellroy/wai-handler-hal-example),
  showing a couple of different approaches to building container images using Nix.

  ## Integrating

  Actually calling the Lambda is done with a [Lambda proxy
  integration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-lambda-proxy-integrations.html)
  from an [API Gateway REST
  API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-rest-api.html).

  The simplest possible integration sends every request to the Lambda
  (where the `wai` `Application` can return 404 or whatever if the
  endpoint doesn't match). This is done by mapping the paths `/` and
  `/{proxy+}` for the HTTP method `ANY`. We do this in our [CDK example](https://github.com/bellroy/wai-handler-hal-example/tree/master/wai-handler-hal-cdk),
  and [CDK provides a Construct](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_apigateway.LambdaRestApi.html) which encapsulates this pattern, making
  it extremely simple to deploy.

  ### Splitting Servant applications

  While it's simplest to back the entire API with a single Lambda, it
  does mean that you risk one Lambda carrying an ever-expanding set of
  IAM permissions. Servant's combinators make it easy to break the API
  into parts that are served by individual Lambdas, which can each have
  the minimal set of permissions attached to their role. If your Servant
  service had endpoints `foo`, `bar`, and `baz`, you'd serve them all
  from Warp with an expression like `Warp.runEnv 8080 . Servant.serve $
  foo :<|> bar :<|> baz`. But `Servant.serve foo`, `Servant.serve bar`,
  and `Servant.serve baz` are also all WAI `Application`s, and can each
  be bundled into distinct Lambda functions using `wai-handler-hal`.

  ### Other caveats

  * The stage name in a path segment is not passed to the Lambda, so it
    is not passed to the `wai` `Application`. An invoke URL like
    `https://abcde12345.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/hoot`
    will send `pathInfo = ["hoot"]` to the `Application`.
