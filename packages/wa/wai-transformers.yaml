  ================

  Simple parameterization of Wai's `Application` and `Middleware` types.


  ## Overview

  Wai's `Application` type is defined as follows:

  ```haskell
  type Application = Request -> (Response -> IO ResponseReceived) -> IO ResponseReceived
  ```

  This is great for the server - we can just `flip ($)` the middlewares together to get
  an effectful server. However, what if we want to encode useful information in our
  middleware chain / end-point application? Something like a `ReaderT Env` environment,
  where useful data like a universal salt, current hostname, or global mutable references can
  be referenced later if it were wedged-in.

  The design looks like this:

  ```haskell
  type ApplicationT m = Request -> (Response -> IO ResponseReceived) -> m ResponseReceived
  ```

  Now we can encode MTL-style contexts with applications we write

  ```haskell
  type MiddlewareT m = ApplicationT m -> ApplicationT m


  data AuthConfig = AuthConfig
    { authFunction :: Request -> Either AuthException (Response -> Response)
    }

  simpleAuth :: ( MonadReader AuthConfig m
                , MonadError AuthException m
                ) => MiddlewareT m
  simpleAuth app req resp = do
    auth <- authFunction <$> ask
    case auth req of
      Left e = throwError e
      Right f = app req (resp . f)

  simpleAuth' :: Middleware
  simpleAuth' app req resp =
    eReceived <- runExceptT $ runReaderT (simpleAuth app req resp) myAuthConfig
    case eReceived of
      Left e = resp $ respondLBS "Unauthorized!"
      Right r = return r
  ```
