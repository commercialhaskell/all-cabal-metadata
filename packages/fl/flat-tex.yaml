  flat-tex
  ========

  The use case for this tool is:
  your paper has been accepted at a conference, and now you have
  to submit the latex sources for inclusion in the proceedings.

  But - your sources contain some information that you don't want
  to reveal. E.g., it contains  `\todo{fix proof of previous theorem}`.

  `flat-tex` does the following:
  * flatten a multi-file latex document (recursively expanding all `\input` and `\bibliography`)
  * remove all `\todo{..}`, `\reminder{..}` and comments (`% ...`)

  How `\input{foo}` is expanded:
  * if the file `foo` does exist, then it is processed
  * else `foo.tex` is processed

  How `\bibliography{...}`is expanded:
  * the file `top.bbl` is processed, where `top.tex` is the file that contains the `\bibliography`  statement
