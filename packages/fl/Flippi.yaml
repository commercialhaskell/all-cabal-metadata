description: "Flippi v0.03: A Wiki clone written in Haskell\r\n=============================================\r\n\r\nAs
  the title suggests, Flippi is a Wiki clone - a fairly basic one at \r\npresent,
  written in Haskell by Philippa Cowderoy and released under the BSD\r\nlicense. There's
  an installation of Flippi running at \r\nhttp://www.scannedinavian.org/cgi-bin/flippi/flippi
  - hopefully, details of\r\nuser modifications, new releases etc will be kept there.\r\n\r\nRequirements:
  Flippi is written in plain Haskell 98 using a recent version\r\n              of
  the hierarchical libraries - it builds fine under \r\n              GHC 6.21, doesn't
  build under 5.02, hasn't been tested anywhere\r\n              else.\r\n\r\nTo configure:
  Edit the source a little. The only really critical thing is\r\n              where
  the data files go - this can be changed by editing the\r\n              function
  dataDirectory in the PageIO module. The default is a\r\n              directory
  data under the directory Flippi is run from.\r\n              \r\n              To
  change how the pages look on screen, edit PageTemplates.hs.\r\n              \r\n
  \             To change the wiki markup, edit DeWikify.hs.\r\n              \r\n
  \             Scripts are ordinary functions of type \r\n              [(String,String)]
  -> IO Html - to make one available, add an\r\n              entry to the list \"scripts\"
  in Scripts.hs. It's probably a\r\n              good idea if anybody distributing
  scripts they've written\r\n              includes a fuller description of how to
  do this in the \r\n              documentation so as to make things easier for users
  who don't\r\n              know Haskell.\r\n\r\nInstallation: Should be pretty simple:
  either compile the lot (a GHC --make \r\n              works fine) and set it up
  as a CGI executable or run it via \r\n              your preferred Haskell interpreter
  like any other script.\r\n              \r\n              GHC users should find
  some variant on this works:\r\n              \"ghc --make Flippi.hs -o <foo>\" where
  <foo> is the name of \r\n              the resulting executable.\r\n              \r\n
  \             Optionally, copy the files found under data\\ in the \r\n              distribution
  to wherever the CGI will be looking for page\r\n              data - these initial
  pages document the markup syntax and tell \r\n              users you're running
  Flippi. If you don't want to do this, \r\n              you'll want to create a
  FrontPage - point a browser at the CGI\r\n              and follow the link to create
  it.\r\n\r\nHistory:\r\n--------\r\n\r\nv0.03: * Added scripting API and corresponding
  syntax \r\n          (see Script.hs, ScriptSyntax.hs)\r\n       * Added RecentChanges
  script\r\n       * Added HelloWorld example script in Script.hs\r\n       * Added
  getPagenames to PageIO\r\n       * Restricted page requests to valid pagenames as
  defined by a\r\n         pattern in DeWikify (an isPagename function is exported
  by\r\n         PageIO)\r\n       * hopefully removed DOS/UNIX data issue - all data
  files are now \r\n         written out in binary format, all input is done in text
  mode and\r\n         then has CRLFs forcibly converted to LFs. The parser will read
  \r\n         both LF and CRLF as new lines, though this should never be \r\n         needed
  now.\r\n       * Data files now go in a specified directory rather than having\r\n
  \        a specified prefix\r\n       * A couple more bugfixes\r\n\r\nv0.02: * Added
  proper (first edit wins) edit conflict resolution\r\n       * Fixed some potential
  holes such as editing the page \"\"\r\n       * Better page templates\r\n       *
  Enough markup to just about be usable (paragraphs, escapes)\r\n\r\nv0.01: * Early
  version shown to a few friends\r\n       * Missing just about everything! But it
  does page IO\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThanks to Shae Erisson for encouragement,
  discussion, a test server and above\r\nall else naming Flippi - if you don't like
  the name, blame it on him!\r\n\r\n-- \r\nPhilippa Cowderoy\r\nflippa@flippac.org\r\n"
