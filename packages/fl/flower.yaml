  flower - FLOWgram ExtractoR tools

  This is now obsolete, please install the biosff library
  (which includes the 'flower' exectuable) instead.

  The flower executable reads files in SFF-format and produces various output,
  including sequences with quality, or flowgram data in tabular format.  By default,
  it outputs a textual representation of the data in the SFF-file, much like
  'sffinfo' from Roche does.

  The flowselect executable extracts reads from SFF-files, generating a new
  SFF-file with a subset of the reads based on various quality criteria.

  The flowt program removes (artificial) duplicates from SFF files.  It's currently a work
  in progress, but included if you'd like to play with it.  It's faster than other approaches
  (e.g. CD-HIT), and ought to be more sensitive and specific, but this needs to be proven.
