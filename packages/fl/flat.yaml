changelog: "Significant and compatibility-breaking changes.\n\n\nVersion 0.6:\n    -
  [**breaking**] Renamed Repr to AsBin and SizeOf to AsSize\n    - Faster AsBin implementation
  \n    - Fixed AsSize implementation (SizeOf worked only for types with custom size
  implementation and returned max size, not actual size)\n\nVersion 0.5.2:\n    -
  Fixed https://github.com/Quid2/flat/issues/28 that could cause an undetected overflow
  when decoding out of range Int/Word values\n    - Added UTF16Text and Data.ByteString.Short
  support for ghcjs\n    - Improved speed and accuracy of encoded Text size calculation
  (for encoding)\n    - [**breaking**] Removed `textBytes` from Flat.Encoder.Size
  (breaking but insignificant)\n\nVersion 0.5:\n    - Compatibility with ghc 9.0.2
  & 9.2.4 & 9.4.2\n    - Compatibility with text-2.0 (GHC)\n    - Fixed https://github.com/Quid2/flat/issues/23
  that could cause an encoding failure for non byte aligned Arrays \n    - Fixed https://github.com/Quid2/flat/pull/26
  that could cause the decoder to read beyond the end of the decoding buffer (causing
  a SEGFAULT on ghcjs)\n    - Merged https://github.com/Quid2/flat/pull/22 - fails
  correctly on invalid UTF-8 text \n    - Added a few ways to partially or incrementally
  decode values, see Flat.Repr and Flat.Decoder.Run.listTDecoder\n    - Moved strictDecoder
  from Flat.Decoder.Types to Flat.Decoder\n    - Removed Flat instance for Semigroup.Option
  from Flat.Instances.Base\n    - Moved overlapping/specialised Flat instance for
  [Char] to Flat.Instances.Extra\n    - Added a few extra functions\n\nVersion 0.4.4:\n\t-
  Added instances for Identity, Monoid.Dual/All/Any/Sum/Product/Alt, Semigroup.Min/Max/First/Last/Option
  \n\nVersion 0.4.2:\n\t- Fixed links in README.md\n\t- Added multiple stack.yaml
  files for different LTS\n\nVersion 0.4:\n    - Compatibility with ghc 8.8.3\n\t-
  Data.Seq.Seq is serialised as a List (previously was serialised as an Array)\n\t-
  Changed namespace from Data.Flat to Flat\n\t- Addtional Flat Instances for some
  common packages: array, base, bytestring, containers, dlist, text, unordered-containers,
  vector\n\t- Additional doctests, with a static version that can run without ghci
  and therefore also under ghcjs/eta (run it with stack test :doc-static)\n\t- Many
  minor changes\n\nVersion 0.3.4:\n\t- Redisegned Generics-based instance generation
  (Data.Flat.Class) to reduce compilation time and improve encoding and decoding performance\n\t-
  Fixed GHCJS Double bug and tested GHCJS with full test suite\n\nVersion 0.3.2:\n\t-
  Tested with ghc 8.2.1\n\t- Dropped dependencies on the 'cpu', 'derive' and 'tasty'
  packages to make it compatible with the Eta compiler (https://github.com/typelead/eta)\n\nVersion
  0.3:\n\t- Removed 'flatStrict' and 'unflatStrict' (use 'flat' and 'unflat' instead
  that also encode/decode strictly)\n\t- `unflatWith` now takes a decoder for the
  unpadded value (previously it expected a padded decoder) and decodes the padded
  value\n\t- Added some decoding primitives\n\t- Added Data.ByteString.Convert\n"

description: "\n![Build Status](https://github.com/Quid2/flat/actions/workflows/haskell-ci.yml/badge.svg)\n\n[![Hackage
  version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/flat.svg)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/flat)\n\n[![Stackage
  LTS 16](http://stackage.org/package/flat/badge/lts-16)](http://stackage.org/lts/package/flat)\n[![Stackage
  LTS 18](http://stackage.org/package/flat/badge/lts-18)](http://stackage.org/lts/package/flat)\n[![Stackage

  Nightly](http://stackage.org/package/flat/badge/nightly)](http://stackage.org/nightly/package/flat)\n\nHaskell
  implementation of [Flat](http://quid2.org/docs/Flat.pdf), a principled, portable
  and compact binary data format ([specs](http://quid2.org)).\n\n\n### How To Use
  It For Fun and Profit\n\n```haskell\n{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric, DeriveAnyClass
  #-}\n```\n\n```haskell\nimport Flat\n```\n\n\n\n```haskell\ndata Direction = North
  | South | Center | East | West deriving (Show,Generic,Flat)\n```\n\nUse **flat**
  to encode: \n\n```haskell\nflat [North,South]\n-> \"\\149\"\n```\n\n\nand **unflat**
  to decode:\n\n```haskell\nunflat (flat [North,South]) :: Decoded [Direction]\n->
  Right [ North , South ]\n```\n\n\nAnd thanks to Flat's bit-encoding, this list fits
  in 1 byte (rather than the 5 bytes that would be required by a traditional byte
  encoding):\n\n```haskell\nflatBits [North,South]\n-> \"10010101\"\n```\n\n\n\n###
  Performance\n\nFor some hard data, see this [comparison of the major haskell serialisation
  libraries](https://github.com/haskell-perf/serialization).\n\nBriefly:\n * Size:
  `flat` produces significantly smaller binaries than all other libraries (3/4 times
  usually)\n * Serialization time: `store`, `persist` and `flat` are faster\n * Deserialization
  time: `store`, `flat`, `persist` and `cereal` are faster\n * Transfer time (serialisation
  time + transport time on the network + deserialisation at the receiving end): `flat`
  is usually faster for all but the highest network speeds\n\n### Documentation\n\n*
  [Tutorial](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/flat/docs/Flat-Tutorial.html)\n\n*
  [Hackage Package and Docs](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/flat)\n\n* [Flat Format
  Specification](http://quid2.org/docs/Flat.pdf)\n\n### Installation\n\nGet the latest
  stable version from [hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/flat).\n\n###
  Compatibility\n\nTested with:\n\n* [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) 7.10.3 to
  9.4.3 (x64)\n\n\n* [GHCJS](https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs) version 8.6.0.1 (GHC
  8.6.2) \n\n\n\n### Known Bugs and Infelicities\n\n* Data types with more than 512
  constructors are currently unsupported (but support could be easily added if necessary)\n\n*
  Longish compilation times\n\n  * To improve performance, `flat` relies on extensive
  inlining. This unfortunately leads to longer compilation times.\n\n    If you have
  many data types or very large ones, you might want to: \n\n      * During development,
  turn optimisations off (`stack --fast` or `-O0` in the cabal file).\n\n      * Keep
  your serialisation code in separate modules.\n\n* See also the [full list of open
  issues](https://github.com/Quid2/flat/issues).\n\n### Ports for other languages\n\n[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
  and [TypeScript-JavaScript](https://github.com/Quid2/ts) ports are under development.\n\n\nGet
  in touch if you would like to help porting `flat` to other languages.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n`flat`
  reuses ideas and readapts code from various packages, mainly: `store`, `binary-bits`
  and `binary` and includes bug fixes from a number of contributors.\n\n### Other
  Stuff You Might Like\n\nTo decode `flat` encoded data you need to know the type
  of the serialised data.\n\nThis is ok for applications that do not require long-term
  storage and that do not operate in open distributed systems.\n\nFor those who do,
  you might want to supplement `flat` with [ZM - Language independent, reproducible,
  absolute types](https://github.com/Quid2/zm).\n"
