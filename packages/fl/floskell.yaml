  # Floskell

  [![Hackage][hackage-image]][hackage-url]
  [![Build Status][ci-image]][ci-url]
  [![License][license-image]][license-url]

  Floskell is a flexible Haskell source code pretty printer.

  [Documentation](https://github.com/ennocramer/floskell/blob/master/README.md)

  [Examples](https://github.com/ennocramer/floskell/blob/master/styles)

  Floskell started as a fork of version 4 of [Chris Done's
  hindent](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/hindent).  The
  formatting styles present in hindent 4 have been preserved in spirit,
  but generally will not produce exactly the same output.


  ## Installation

      git clone https://github.com/ennocramer/floskell
      cd floskell
      stack install


  ## Usage

  Floskell can be used to reformat Haskell source files in place

      floskell path/to/sourcefile.hs

  or as a pipeline processor

      cat path/to/sourcefile.hs | floskell > outfile.hs

  One of the predefined formatting styles can be selected with the
  `--style` option

      floskell --style cramer path/to/sourcefile.hs

  Or the style can be read from a configuration file

      floskell --config path/to/config.json path/to/sourcefile.hs

  If neither style nor configuration file is given on the command line,
  Floskell will try to find a configuration file in the current working
  directory or any of its parent directories, or fall back to the users
  global configuration file.


  ## Formatting Process

  A style in Floskell is a set of formatting possibilities for different
  language constructs.  Floskell formats Haskell code according to a
  given style by finding the combination of allowed formatting choices
  that result in the best overall layout.

  ### Penalty

  The overall layout of the generated output is judged by a penalty
  function.  This function takes into account the number of lines
  generated, whether lines are longer than a defined limit, and the
  indentation of each line.

  In general, Floskell will try to generate

  * the smallest number of lines,

  * the least amount of indentation, and

  * the least amount of overflow.

  ### Layout

  A number of language constructs can be formatted in different ways.
  Floskell generally defines two layout choices for these constructs,
  `flex` and `vertical`, and three modes to apply these choices, `flex`,
  `vertical`, and `try-oneline`.

  The layout choice `flex` generally tries to fit as much on each line
  as possible, but allows linebreaks in a number of places, while the
  `vertical` layout choice forces linebreaks in various places.

  The `flex` and `vertical` layout modes simply select the respective
  layout choice, while `try-oneline` will first try `flex`, but replace
  the choice with `vertical` if the `flex` layout would more than one
  line or an overfull line.

  An example:

  ```haskell
  -- flex layout for con-decls
  data Enum = One | Two | Three

  -- vertical layout for con-decls
  data Enum = One
            | Two
            | Three
  ```

  ### Indentation

  A number of language constructs can apply indentation to sub-elements.
  Floskell provides two different indentation choices, `aligned` and
  `indented`, and three modes to apply these choices, `align`,
  `indent-by n`, and `align-or-indent-by n`.

  `align` will start the sub-element on the same line and raise the
  indentation to align following lines, while `indent-by n` will start
  the sub-element on the following line with the indentation raised by
  `n`.

  `align-or-indent-by n` will allow either choice and select the
  formatting with the least penalty.

  An example:

  ```haskell
  -- align for do
  foo = do x <- xs
           y <- ys
           return (x, y)

  -- indent-by 4 for do
  foo = do
      x <- xs
      y <- ys
      return (x, y)
  ```

  ### Tabstop Alignment

  Some language constructs allow for tabstop alignment.  Alignment is
  optional and subject to configurable limits, regarding the amount of
  added whitespace.

  An example:

  ```haskell
  -- let without alignment
  let foo = bar
      quux = quuz
  in foo quux

  -- let with alignment
  let foo    = bar
      quuuux = quuz
  in foo quuuux
  ```

  ### Whitespace

  Floskell allows the customization of whitespace around infix
  operators, as well as inside parentheses and other enclosing
  punctuation characters.

  The presence of whitespace or linebreaks is as `before`, meaning
  before the operator/enclosed item, `after`, meaning after the
  operator/enclosed item, or `both`, meaning both before and after the
  operator/enclosed item.

  Whitespace configuration can depend on the context where an operator
  or enclosing punctuation is used.  The context can be one of
  `declaration`, `type`, `pattern`, `expression`, or `other`.

  An example:

  ```haskell
  -- tuple with space after/before parentheses and after comma
  tuple = ( 1, 2 )
  -- tuple without any spaces
  tuple = (1,2)
  ```

  ### Preprocessor Directives (CPP)

  Floskell, in general, supports Haskell source with conditional
  compilation directives using the `CPP` language extensions.  However,
  due to the way this support is implemented, some care must be taken to
  not confuse the Haskell source parser.

  Floskell treats conditional compilation directives as if they were
  simply comments.  As a consequence, the input must still be valid
  Haskell when all preprocessor lines are removed.  This is relevant
  when using `#if`/`#else`/`#endif` sequences, as Floskell will see both
  the if- and else-block in sequence.  For example, the following cannot
  be processed with Floskell, as the first declaration of `prettyPrint`
  ends with an incomplete `do` block:

  ```haskell
  #if MIN_VERSION_haskell_src_exts(1,21,0)
      prettyPrint (GadtDecl _ name _ _ mfielddecls ty) = do
  #else
      prettyPrint (GadtDecl _ name mfielddecls ty) = do
  #endif
          pretty name
          operator Declaration "::"
          mayM_ mfielddecls $ \decls -> do
              prettyRecordFields len Declaration decls
              operator Type "->"
          pretty ty
  ```

  Instead, some of the contents of the `do` block have to be duplicated,
  so that the contents of the `#if` are valid Haskell on their own.

  ```haskell
  #if MIN_VERSION_haskell_src_exts(1,21,0)
      prettyPrint (GadtDecl _ name _ _ mfielddecls ty) = do
          pretty name
          operator Declaration "::"
          mayM_ mfielddecls $ \decls -> do
              prettyRecordFields len Declaration decls
              operator Type "->"
          pretty ty
  #else
      prettyPrint (GadtDecl _ name mfielddecls ty) = do
          pretty name
          operator Declaration "::"
          mayM_ mfielddecls $ \decls -> do
              prettyRecordFields len Declaration decls
              operator Type "->"
          pretty ty
  #endif
  ```


  ## Customization

  Floskell's behaviour and the style of its output can be modified with
  a configuration file.

  See the documentation on the [Configuration Format](CONFIGURATION.md)
  for a detailed description of the contents of the configuration file.

  ### Initial Configuration

  The `--print-config` command line option can be used to create an
  initial configuration file.

      floskell --style cramer --print-config > ~/.floskell.json

  This command will create a configuration file with all fields and the
  entire definition of the selected style in the `formatting` block.

  ### Configuration File Location

  * If a style is given on the command line, but no explicit
    configuration file, the style will be used as-is and no
    configuration file will be loaded.

  * If both a style and an explicit configuration file are given on the
    command line, the explicit configuration file will be loaded and the
    style parameter will replace any style setting in the configuration
    file.

  * If neither style nor explicit configuration file are given on the
    command line, Floskell will try to find an applicable configuration
    file.  Floskell will look for

    * a file called `floskell.json` in the current working directory and
      all its parent directories,

    * a file called `config.json` in `~/.floskell`, `~/config/floskell`,
      or `%APPDATA%/floskell`, and lastly

    * a file called `.floskell.json` in `~` or `~/.config`.

    Only the first file found will be loaded.


  ## Editor Integration

  ### Emacs

  In
  [contrib/floskell.el](https://github.com/ennocramer/floskell/blob/master/contrib/floskell.el)
  there is `floskell-mode`, which provides keybindings to reindent parts
  of the buffer:

  - `M-q` reformats the current declaration.  When inside a comment, it
    fills the current paragraph instead, like the standard `M-q`.
  - `C-M-\` reformats the current region.

  To enable it, add the following to your init file:

  ```lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/floskell/contrib")
  (require 'floskell)
  (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook #'floskell-mode)
  ```

  By default, Floskell uses the style called `base`.  If you want to use
  another, run `M-x customize-variable floskell-style` or create a
  Floskell configuration file in your home directory. If you want to
  configure per-project, add a configuration file in the project root or
  make a file called `.dir-locals.el` in the project root directory like
  this:

  ``` lisp
  ((nil . ((floskell-style . "johan-tibell"))))
  ```

  ### Vim

  The `'formatprg'` option lets you use an external program (like
  floskell) to format your text. Put the following line into
  ~/.vim/ftplugin/haskell.vim to set this option for Haskell files:

      setlocal formatprg=floskell\ --style\ chris-done

  Then you can format with floskell using `gq`. Read `:help gq` and `help
  'formatprg'` for more details.

  Note that unlike in emacs you have to take care of selecting a
  sensible buffer region as input to floskell yourself. If that is too
  much trouble you can try
  [vim-textobj-haskell](https://github.com/gilligan/vim-textobj-haskell)
  which provides a text object for top level bindings.

  ### Atom

  Basic support is provided through
  [contrib/floskell.coffee](https://github.com/ennocramer/floskell/blob/master/contrib/floskell.coffee),
  which adds floskell to atom menu with each available style, and
  `Default` which will use the appropriate configuration file. Mode
  should be installed as package into `.atom\packages\${PACKAGE_NAME}`,
  here is simple example of atom
  [package](https://github.com/Heather/atom-hindent).
