description: |-
  flat-mcmc is a Haskell library for painless, efficient, general-purpose
  sampling from continuous distributions.

  flat-mcmc uses an ensemble sampler that is invariant to affine
  transformations of space.  It wanders a target probability distribution's
  parameter space as if it had been "flattened" or "unstretched" in some sense,
  allowing many particles to explore it locally and in parallel.

  In general this sampler is useful when you want decent performance without
  dealing with any tuning parameters or local proposal distributions.

  flat-mcmc exports an 'mcmc' function that prints a trace to stdout, as well
  as a 'flat' transition operator that can be used more generally.
