description: "= hsflickr - Programming Flickr from Haskell =\r\n\r\n'hsflickr' is
  a Haskell package providing a binding to\r\nthe Flickr API - http://www.flickr.com/services/api/\r\n\r\nThe
  binding is functionally complete (Nov 2008), letting\r\nyou write applications in
  Haskell that access and manipulates\r\ncontent on Flickr, either public information
  or per-user\r\nphotos and properties. Including the uploading of new photos.\r\n\r\n=
  Getting started =\r\n\r\nFor some code samples showing you how to get started using
  this\r\nAPI binding, have a look in the examples/ directory. \r\n\r\n= Building
  and installing =\r\n\r\nThis package is provided in Cabal form, so only thing you
  need to\r\ndo to get going is:\r\n\r\n  foo% runghc Setup configure\r\n  foo% runghc
  Setup build \r\n  foo% runghc Setup install\r\n\r\nThe package depends on a bunch
  of other packages though, so you\r\nneed to have them built&installed, as well.
  They are:\r\n\r\n  * HTTP: http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/HTTP\r\n
  \ * xml:  http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/xml\r\n  *
  mime >= 0.3: http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/mime\r\n
  \ * utf8-string: http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/utf8-string\r\n\r\n=
  Authentication =\r\n\r\nTo use this API binding to build your own Flickr application,
  you ought\r\nto apply for your own set of API keys to identify yourself with when\r\nprompting
  the user. See, http://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/apply/ , \r\nfor how to apply
  -- use either a 'mobile' or 'web' type of key. With\r\nthat API key, instantiate
  your own APIKey value, see Util.Keys for\r\ndefinition of that type + examples of
  its use. \r\n\r\n(The keys that come with the package by default are not guaranteed
  to\r\nstick around for too long, esp. if their use end up being used in inapprop.\r\nways.)\r\n\r\n=
  Feedback / question =\r\n\r\nPlease send them to sof@forkIO.com , and I'll try to
  respond to them\r\nas best/quickly as possible.\r\n"
