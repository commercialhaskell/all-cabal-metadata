changelog: ! "# Version 0.4\n\n* COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE: Fixed `TypeApplications`
  for `flay1` so\n  that @c@ comes first.\n\n* COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE:
  Not exporting `GFlay'`, `gflay'`,\n  `gterminal` anymore.\n\n* COMPILER ASSISTED
  BREAKING CHANGE: `GFlay` and `All` are now type synonyms\n  rather than classes.\n\n*
  COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE: `Flayable1` is not a typeclass anymore.\n  Now
  it is a type synonym for `Flayable` using “quantified constraints” as\n  implemented
  in `Data.Constraint.Forall`. Accordingly, `flay1` is not a\n  typeclass method anymore.\n\n*
  `Generic` types parametrized by a type constructor who have *all* of their\n  immediate
  children fields using said type constructor get a `Flayable`\n  instance for free.\n\n*
  Added `pump`, `dump`, `Pump` and `GPump`.\n\n* Added `GTerminal` instance for `GHC.Generics.U1`.\n\n*
  Added `Fields`, `GFields`, `FieldsF` and `GFieldsF`.\n\n\n# Version 0.3\n\n* BREAKING
  CHANGE: `zip`, `zip1` and `unsafeZip` now take a monadic pairing function, and return\n
  \ `Maybe` where `Nothing` happens in the target indexes do not match.\n\n* BREAKING
  CHANGE: Remove `Record` and `GRecord`.\n\n* Added `trivialize`.\n\n* Generalized
  type of `trivial'`.\n\n\n# Version 0.2\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: The `m` parameter in
  in `Flay` and `Flayable` has been\n  existentialized, to be chosen by the caller.\n\n*
  BREAKING CHANGE: We don't use `DefaultSignatures` for `flay = gflay` anymore.\n
  \ This is very sad, but unfortunately type inferrence for the `c` type variable\n
  \ in new `Flayable` instances doesn't work.\n\n* Added `Flayable1`, `trivial1`,
  `collect1`, `Terminal`, `GTerminal`, `zip1`,\n  `zip`, `Record`, `GRecord`.\n\n*
  Removed `outer`.\n\n* Made compatible with GHC 8.2.2.\n\n\n# Version 0.1\n\n* Initial
  version.\n"
