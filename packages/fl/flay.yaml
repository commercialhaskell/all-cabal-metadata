  # Version 0.5

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE: Fixed `TypeApplications` for `zip1` so
    that @c@ comes first.

  * Documentation improvements.

  * Fixed compilation with GHC 9.8.


  # Version 0.4

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE: Fixed `TypeApplications` for `flay1` so
    that @c@ comes first.

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE: Not exporting `GFlay'`, `gflay'`,
    `gterminal` anymore.

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE: `GFlay` and `All` are now type synonyms
    rather than classes.

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE: `Flayable1` is not a typeclass anymore.
    Now it is a type synonym for `Flayable` using “quantified constraints” as
    implemented in `Data.Constraint.Forall`. Accordingly, `flay1` is not a
    typeclass method anymore.

  * `Generic` types parametrized by a type constructor who have *all* of their
    immediate children fields using said type constructor get a `Flayable`
    instance for free.

  * Added `pump`, `dump`, `Pump` and `GPump`.

  * Added `GTerminal` instance for `GHC.Generics.U1`.

  * Added `Fields`, `GFields`, `FieldsF` and `GFieldsF`.


  # Version 0.3

  * BREAKING CHANGE: `zip`, `zip1` and `unsafeZip` now take a monadic pairing function, and return
    `Maybe` where `Nothing` happens in the target indexes do not match.

  * BREAKING CHANGE: Remove `Record` and `GRecord`.

  * Added `trivialize`.

  * Generalized type of `trivial'`.


  # Version 0.2

  * BREAKING CHANGE: The `m` parameter in in `Flay` and `Flayable` has been
    existentialized, to be chosen by the caller.

  * BREAKING CHANGE: We don't use `DefaultSignatures` for `flay = gflay` anymore.
    This is very sad, but unfortunately type inferrence for the `c` type variable
    in new `Flayable` instances doesn't work.

  * Added `Flayable1`, `trivial1`, `collect1`, `Terminal`, `GTerminal`, `zip1`,
    `zip`, `Record`, `GRecord`.

  * Removed `outer`.

  * Made compatible with GHC 8.2.2.


  # Version 0.1

  * Initial version.
