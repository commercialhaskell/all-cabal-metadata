description: "Flow2dot\n========\n`flow2dot` is a tool to generate nice sequence (flow)
  diagrams from\ntextual descriptions, written in Haskell.\n\nTool itself generates
  a diagram _description_, which could be fed into [GraphViz](www.graphviz.org)\nto
  get a nice-looking picture.\n\nTo try it out, run:\n```\n  runhaskell flow2dot.hs
  sample.flow | dot -T png -o sample.png\n```\nand view \"sample.png\" with your favorite
  picture viewer. Make sure \nversion of `dot` is at least 2.12.\n\nIf you want to
  tweak the output - read Dot manual\nand use it for scaling, colors, pagination etc.\n\nSample
  output\n============\n![sample.png](sample.png)\n\nAcknowledgements\n================\nThanks
  to Cale, quicksilver and roconnor from #haskell for\nsuggestions on how to modularize
  this. Thanks to Dema from\nhaskell@conference.jabber.ru for win32 testing. Gwern0
  helped\nto adapt this to GHC 6.8.2. Radoslav Dorcik sent in parser improvements.\nMike
  Shigorin and Denis Smirnov packaged for Alt Linux and provided feedback\non compatibility
  with different GHC versions. Vasyl Vaskul reported bugs.\n\nKnown issues\n============\n\n*
  Dot < 2.12 will most likely segfault on files generated by flow2dot\n"
