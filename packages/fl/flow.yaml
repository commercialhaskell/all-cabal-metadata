  # [Flow][]

  [![CI](https://github.com/tfausak/flow/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tfausak/flow/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
  [![Hackage](https://badgen.net/hackage/v/flow)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/flow)

  Write more understandable Haskell.

  Flow is a package that provides functions and operators for writing more
  understandable Haskell. It is an alternative to some common idioms like
  [`($)`][] for function application and [`(.)`][] for function composition.

  -   [Requirements](#requirements)
  -   [Installation](#installation)
  -   [Usage](#usage)
      -   [Cheat sheet](#cheat-sheet)

  ## Requirements

  Flow requires a Haskell compiler. It is tested with recent versions of GHC, but
  older or different compilers should be acceptable. For installation with Cabal,
  Flow requires at least Cabal 2.2.

  ## Installation

  To add Flow as a dependency to your package, add it to your Cabal file.

  ```
  build-depends: flow ==2.0.*
  ```

  ## Usage

  Flow is designed to be imported unqualified. It does not export anything that
  conflicts with [the base package][].

  ``` hs
  import Flow
  ```

  ### Cheat sheet

  Flow            | Base
  --------------- | -------------
  <code>x &#124;> f</code> | `x & f`
  <code>f <&#124; x</code> | `f $ x`
  `apply x f`     | `f x`
  `f .> g`        | `f >>> g`
  `g <. f`        | `g . f`
  `compose f g x` | `g (f x)`
  `x !> f`        | -
  `f <! x`        | `f $! x`
  `apply' x f`    | `seq x (f x)`

  ### Converting existing code

  If you want to uniformly use flow operators you can use [HLint] with the
  `hlint-flow.yaml` file. For easy use, it is best to extract the
  `hlint-flow.yaml` to your project directory and do

  ``` sh
  > hlint -h hlint-flow.yaml <source file>
  ```

  or

  ``` sh
  > hlint --git -h hlint-flow.yaml
  ```

  to check all Haskell source tracked by git.

  For more information about Flow, please read [the Haddock documentation][].
