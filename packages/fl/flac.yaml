synopsis: Complete high-level binding to libFLAC
changelog: |
  ## FLAC 0.2.1

  * Maintenance release with more modern and minimal dependencies.

  ## FLAC 0.2.0

  * Got rid of `data-default-class` dependency. Now default values for various
    settings are exported explicitly. This may be a breaking change for you if
    use `def`.

  ## FLAC 0.1.2

  * Documentation and metadata improvements.

  ## FLAC 0.1.1

  * Added support for `DiscTotal` Vorbis comment field.

  ## FLAC 0.1.0

  * Initial release.

  This is a complete high-level Haskell binding to
  [libFLAC](https://xiph.org/flac/)—reference FLAC implementation.

  > As the maintainer of the C FLAC code base, I must say I'm impressed. Quite

  ## Aims of the project

  These are the goals of the project:

  * Be a complete interface for FLAC file manipulation in Haskell.
  * Be as efficient as the underlying C implementation.
  * Provide a safe API using type system to kindly guard against bad things,
    but not too much so as to remain beginner-friendly and simple.

  ## Motivation

  FLAC is awesome and Haskell is awesome, surely there should be a safe
  Haskell API to the fast libFLAC library!

  Seriously though, we have
  [`htaglib`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/htaglib) to work with audio
  metadata, but it does not support FLAC-specific thing I would like to
  manipulate. We have
  [`hsndfile`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hsndfile), but I don't
  really want to read FLAC data into a buffer or Haskell `Vector`. How simple
  is it (if possible) to decode a FLAC file using that library? How simple is
  it to figure out where to begin with such a task? With `flac` it is one line
  of code.

  ## Provided functionality

  `flac` can work with:

  * Metadata—full support for reading/writing/deleting of all audio
    parameters, application data, seek tables, vorbis comments of all sorts,
    CUE sheets, and even pictures.

  * Stream decoder—simple interface for decoding to WAVE and RF64.

  * Stream encoder—a lot of options to tweak, everything that libFLAC
    supports.

  ## Limitations

  Right now there are three main limitations:

  * No Ogg FLAC support, and I do not plan to add it; I'll accept a PR adding
    support for Ogg FLAC.

  * It's not possible to use custom callbacks for printing decoding/encoding
    progress in real-time.

  * Only works on little-endian architectures so far; I'll accept a PR lifting
    this limitation.

  ## Quick start

  The best way to start using `flac` is to take a look at [the
  Haddocks](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/flac). Encoding and decoding
  should be simple to understand, for metadata there are examples in the docs.
  Feel free to ask me a question if you get stuck with something.

  ## Related packages

  The following packages are designed to be used with `flac`:

  * [`flac-picture`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/flac-picture)—add
    pictures to FLAC metadata easier.
