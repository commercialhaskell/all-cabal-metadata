description: |-
  A monad transformer library with type indexes, which allows the
  programmer to get a distinct copy of one of the monads without
  reproducing definitions and instances.  It currently
  supports IdentityX, ReaderX, StateX, WriterX, RWSX, and ErrorX
  monads (and their transformer versions).  All these copies can be
  combined into a transformer stack, including any of the original
  mtl monads. Inspired by the original mtl.  That library was
  inspired by the paper /Functional Programming with Overloading and
  Higher-Order Polymorphism/, by Mark P Jones
  (<http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/pubs/springschool.html>), Advanced
  School of Functional Programming, 1995.  See the Examples.hs file
  for usage.
