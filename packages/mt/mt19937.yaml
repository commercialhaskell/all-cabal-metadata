  ## 0.1.1 (2024-07-14)
    * loosen base lower bounds, can now build with GHC 9.2->9.8 (and maybe 9.10)
    * fix extract erroneously reading from the pre-twist state vector once after
      twisting (thanks gilgamec)

  ## 0.1.0 (2024-03-15)
    * efficient MT19937 (Mersenne Twister) implementation, seemingly correct

  # mt19937
  Efficient MT19937 (standard 32-bit Mersenne Twister PRNG) implementation, in pure Haskell
  (no FFI) with a pure interface.

  Only the PRNG itself is implemented. If you'd like to use this as a PRNG in any
  capacity, you'll need to wrap it into some monad or some such.

  Doesn't seem too useful? You'd be surprised. This was originally written while
  decoding a file header which was bafflingly encoded using a set-seed MT19937.
