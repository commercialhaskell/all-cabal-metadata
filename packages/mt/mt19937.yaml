  # `mt19937`: MT19937 implementation in pure Haskell
  What it says on the box.

  Only the PRNG itself is implemented. If you'd like to use this as a PRNG in any
  capacity, you'll need to wrap it into some monad or some such.

  Doesn't seem too useful? You'd be surprised. This was originally written while
  decoding a file header which was bafflingly encoded using a set-seed MT19937.
