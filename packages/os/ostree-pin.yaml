  ## Summary
  A small utility to move the ostree "pin" to the current ostree deployment.
  eg useful on Fedora Silverblue for preserving
  the current booted deployment image.
  It can be run before booting into a new staged deployment,
  or afterwards using the `--rollback` option.

  ## Help
  `$ ostree-pin --version`
  ```
  0.1.1
  ```
  `$ ostree-pin --help`
  ```
  Tool to update ostree deployment pin

  Usage: ostree-pin [--version] [-n|--dryrun] [-p|--rollback]

    See https://github.com/juhp/ostree-pin#readme

  Available options:
    -h,--help                Show this help text
    --version                Show version
    -n,--dryrun              Dry run
    -p,--rollback            Pin previous (rollback) deployment
  ```

  If you forgot to pin the previous deployment before booting into a newer one,
  you can use `--rollback` to pin it from the newer deployment.

  ## Usage
  ```shellsession
  $ sudo ostree-pin
  removing previous pin
  pinning current deployment
  ```

  ## Install
  Needs the Fedora `ostree-devel` package (or better `ghc-gi-ostree-devel`)
  or `libostree-dev` (Debian/Ubuntu). Also needs ghc and cabal-install (or stack).
  ```
  $ cabal install
  ```
  or from git:
  ```
  $ stack install
  ```

  ## Usage
  ```
  $ sudo ostree-pin
  ```
  Sets the current deployment to pinned,
  and unpins the previously pinned deployment.
  If more than one deployment was pinned it doesn't touch them.

  ostree-pin is distributed under the GPL license version 3 or later.
