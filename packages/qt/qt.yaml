description: "Version 1.1.6.1 of the Qt bindings for Haskell, a set of Haskell bindings
  for the\r\nQt library from Trolltech.  There are no subtantial changes to the code,
  but it\r\nnow compiles with GHC 7.8.\r\n\r\nThere was a bug related to the Foreign
  Function Interface. In most cases that\r\ncould be resolved by importing Foreign.C.Types,
  but not always.  I introduced a\r\ncouple of extra changes to make things compile,
  but there is no guarantee that\r\nthey will work. Actually, I would expect them
  to break. Please, try them, and\r\nif you can find a better solution, send a msg
  or a pull request.\r\n\r\nHtml Documentation for this project can be found in the
  'doc' folder.\r\nThe qtHaskell User Guide includes comprehensive installation instructions.\r\nSee
  examples/ and demos/ for code examples.\r\n"
