changelog: "Version 1.2.3 - released 2009-01-27; changes from 1.2.2\n\n  * Improved
  and expanded Haddock comments throughout.\n  * Fixed allocator mismatch bug in Com.Base.getModuleFileName\n\nVersion
  1.2.2 - released 2009-01-27; changes from 1.2.1\n\n  * built-in enumeration handling
  of variants (via the\n    IEnumVariant interface) was buggy and stale. \n\n  * Fixed
  Integer unmarshalling for Variants; used to\n    go via CURRENCY, now Int64.\n  \n
  \ * Only buildable on Windows platforms.\n\nVersion 1.2.1 - released 2009-01-19;
  changes from 1.2.0\n\n  * fix bad mix of allocators, the accidental introduction
  of the\n    combined use of the CRT one (malloc()) and the COM task allocaotr\n
  \   led to spurious MM crashes.\n  * drop 'haskell98' dependencies\n\n"
