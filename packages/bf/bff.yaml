description: |-
  This is an implementation of the ideas presented in "Bidirectionalization
  for Free!" (paper at POPL'09) by Janis Voigtlaender.

  It also includes an automatic deriver for the Zippable type class.

  Using the cabal flag "binaries" will enable the creation of a web frontend
  to bff, in the form of a CGI program. Make sure you understand the
  security implications before allowing untrusted access to the script.

  Using the cabal flag "stats" will generate programs that collect performance
  statistics about bff and print them as a table.

  Using the cabal flag "render" will generate a program that renders collected
  performance statistics as PDF files.

  You may also want to check out later work combining the implementation here
  with other methods:
