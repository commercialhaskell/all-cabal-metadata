description: |-
  An abstract interface to highly-parameterizable queues/deques.

  Background: There exists a feature space for queues that extends between:

  * simple, single-ended, non-concurrent, bounded queues

  * double-ended, threadsafe, growable queues

  ... with important points inbetween (such as
  the queues used for work-stealing).

  This package includes an interface for Deques that allows the
  programmer to use a single API for all of the above, while using the
  type-system to select an efficient implementation given the
  requirements (using type families).

  This package also includes a simple reference implementation based
  on 'IORef' and "Data.Sequence".
