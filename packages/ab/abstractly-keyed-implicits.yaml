  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2025-12-25

  * Fully implement proposal
changelog-type: markdown
description: |-
  Manage the implicit parameter namespace dynamically at compile time.

  This is an implementation of [GHC proposal 737](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/737).
  Relative to that proposal, this suffers from the following (likely hypothetical) limitations:

    * It may break if future GHC versions change the implementation of implicit parameters
    * It doesn't mandate that 'bindImplicit' and 'implicitParameter' be fully applied,
      nor guarantee that they don't impose additional runtime cost.
    * It uses some auxiliary internal type-level machinery that can't be hidden.
    * It is not inferred as safe Haskell (though it is safe).
