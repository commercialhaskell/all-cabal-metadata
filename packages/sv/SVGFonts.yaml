changelog: |
  1.8.0.1 (1 Nov 2021)
  --------------------

  - Include a migration guide for updating to version 1.8.

  1.8 (15 Oct 2021)
  -----------------

  - `Graphics.SVGFonts` and `Graphics.SVGFonts.Text` have been greatly
    refactored and many of the names have changed.  The `textSVG`
    function is still provided for a bit of backwards compatibility.
  - New module `Graphics.SVGFonts.Wrap` for configurable text wrapping.

  1.7.0.1-r2 (17 Sep 2021)
  ------------------------

  - Bump upper bounds to build with GHC 9.0 and `diagrams-core-1.5`.

  1.7.0.1 (29 Jan 2019)
  ---------------------

  - Remove strange kerning values in `LinLibertineCut.svg`. ([#29](https://github.com/diagrams/SVGFonts/issues/29))
  - Remove non-ASCII character from `LinLibertine.svg` so users don't
    have to worry about encoding/locale
    settings. ([#30](https://github.com/diagrams/SVGFonts/issues/30))

  1.7 (9 May 2018)
  ---------------------

  - Fixed a bug (Fontforge seems to use SVG namespace for some time, which it didn't before)
  - `unsafePerformIO` removed
  - drop support for GHC 7.6
  - Build with GHC-8.4

  1.6.0.3 (25 September 2017)
  ---------------------------

  - Fix link on Hackage page

  1.6.0.2 (21 August 2017)
  ------------------------

  - Bug fix: don't print blank line to stdout when there are no errors. (#23)
    Thanks to Tim Docker for the fix.

  1.6.0.1 (27 October 2016)
  -------------------------

  - Allow `diagrams-core-1.4`
  - Allow `diagrams-lib-1.4`

  1.6 (8 August 2016)
  -------------------

  - Performance improvement: port ReadPath to use attoparsec
  - New `loadFont'` function, to read font data from an XmlSource
  - Export `Kern(..)` from `Graphics.SVGFonts.ReadFont`
  - New `Serialize` instances for `FontData` and `Kern`

  1.5.0.1 (6 June 2016)
  ---------------------

  - allow `base-4.9`
  - allow `data-default-class-0.1`
  - test with GHC 8.0.1

  1.5.0.0 (19 April 2015)
  -----------------------

  - Split functionality out of `ReadFont`, into `Fonts` (built-in fonts) and
    `Text` (rendering text to Diagrams).
  - `textSVG'` and `textSVG_` now have the text as a separate argument,
    distinct from `TextOptions`.
  - `ReadFont` does not use `unsafePerformIO` any more. `unsafePerformIO` is
    now only used to load built-in fonts.

  1.4.0.3 (2 June 2014)
  ----------------------

  - Allow `diagrams-lib-1.2`.

  1.4.0.1 (25 November 2013)
  --------------------------

  - Bump `diagrams-lib` upper bound to `< 1.1`.

  1.4 (10 September 2013)
  -----------------------

  - `FontData` can now be written back to SVG using `makeSvgFont` inside of the `WriteFont` module.
    It is possible to only write back a specfic set of glyphs.
  - The SVG `font-face` element is now completely supported.
    This means all possible attributes are read and written back to it.
    Correct defaults are also set on non optional attributes. Some optional attributes are still
    required though, due to their use in font rendering.
  - The `ReadPath` module does not use `unsafePerformIO` anymore. `ReadFont` is now the only module with unsafe calls.
  - Minor bug fixes:
    - `stemh` and `stemv` are now optional attributes.

  1.3.0.2 (14 August 2013)
  ------------------------

  - remove old comment causing Haddock build to fail

  1.3.0.1 (12 August 2013)
  ------------------------

  - fix repo location in .cabal file

  1.3: 9 August 2013
  ------------------

  - A bunch of bug fixes, cleanup, and reorganization:
    - Proper data type for `Kern` and `FontData` instead of mega-tuples.
    - Fixed several `Prelude.read` error on `font-face` attributes.
    - Fixed wrong attribute names.
    - Switched to `data-default-class` instead of `data-default`.
  - Require `diagrams-lib-0.7`.

  # SVGFonts

  Native font support for the Diagrams library. The SVG-Font format is
  easy to parse and was therefore chosen for a font library completely
  written in Haskell.

  You can convert your own font to SVG with
  [FontForge](http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/) or use one of the
  SVG fonts included with the library.

  ## Features

  Complete implementation of the features that fontforge produces (but
  not the complete SVG format):

  * Kerning (e.g. the two characters in "VA" have a shorter distance than in "VV")
  * Unicode
  * Ligatures
  * Text boxes with syntax highlighting

  XML speed issues can be solved by trimming the svg file to only those
  characters that are used (or maybe binary xml one day)

  Version 1.0 of this library supports texturing which would only make
  sense in a Diagrams Backend that does rasterization in Haskell.

  ## Example

  ```
  import Diagrams.Prelude
  import Diagrams.Backend.SVG.CmdLine
  import qualified Graphics.SVGFonts as F

  main = do
    font <- F.loadFont "/path/to/font.svg"
    let
      diagram :: Diagram B
      diagram =
        (F.drop_rect$ F.fit_height 22$ F.svgText def{F.textFont = font} "Hello World!")
        # stroke # fc blue # lc blue # bg lightgrey # fillRule EvenOdd # showOrigin
    mainWith diagram
  ```

  ## Usage

  Convert your favourite font (*i.e.* `.ttf`) into a `.svg` file with
  fontforge (the menu item under "Save All"). If a font converted on
  your own doesn't work, try the repair options, and if this still
  doesn't work edit the file by hand or [report an
  issue](https://github.com/diagrams/SVGFonts/issues).  Remember that a
  lot of fonts are not allowed to be distributed freely.

  ## Porting to version 1.8

  Version 1.8 of the library greatly improved the API but introduced a
  number of breaking changes.

  Previously, functions provided by the library took a large `TextOpts`
  options record and directly produced a diagrams `Path`. For example,
  it was common to see code like this:

  ```
  text' font h s = (strokeP $ textSVG' (TextOpts font INSIDE_H KERN False h h) s)
                 # lw none # fc black
  ```

  Compared to this, version 1.8:
  - Introduces a new intermediate type `PathInRect`
  - Splits out width and height options into dedicated
    combinators such as `fit_width` and `fit_height`
  - There are also several new functions that allow specifying width and
    height in different ways, such as `svgText_fitRect` and `svgText_fitRect_stretchySpace`.

  The only things remaining in `TextOpts` are options for the font,
  spacing mode, and underline.

  Here is an idiomatic way to translate the above example code into the
  new API:

  ```
  text' font h s
    = s
    # svgText def { textFont = font }
    # fit_height h
    # set_envelope
    # lw none # fc black
  ```

  - We use the `svgText` function with a default options record `def`,
    overriding the `textFont` field to set the font explicitly.
  - We then use the `fit_height` function to scale the resulting text so
    it has height `h`.  This corresponds to our previous use of
    `INSIDE_H`.  This is probably the most common mode, but `fit_width`
    and `svgText_fitRect` also available.
  - Finally, we call `set_envelope` which converts a `PathInRect` to a
    `Diagram`, by stroking the text path and appropriately setting the
    envelope.
  - If you actually want an explicit `Path` instead of a `Diagram`, you
    can call `drop_rect` instead of `set_envelope`.
  - Note that the old `textSVG'` function resulted in a centered local
    origin, whereas all the new API functions result in a local origin
    and the left end of the text baseline.  If you need the text
    centered, you can of course call `centerXY`.
