changelog: "# Changelog for epi-sim\n\n## 0.4.2\n\n- Include `simulationWithGenIO`
  and add `scRequireCherry` to the\n  `SimulationConfiguration` record type to make
  it easier to control how\n  simulations are conditioned upon particular observations.\n-
  Documentation.\n- Bug fix in edge case of no sequenced samples.\n\n## 0.4.1\n\n-
  Update the `simulationWithSystemRandom` function so that this works again.\n\n##
  0.4.0.0\n\n- The following changes to the `EpidemicEvent` type will be the real
  sticking\n  point in moving from `0.3.0.0` to `0.4.0.0`:\n  \n```\n-- | Events that
  can occur in an epidemic with their absolute time.\ndata EpidemicEvent\n  = Infection
  AbsoluteTime Person Person -- ^ infection time, infector, infectee\n  | Removal
  AbsoluteTime Person -- ^ removal without observation\n  | Sampling AbsoluteTime
  Person -- ^ removal and inclusion in phylogeny\n  | Catastrophe AbsoluteTime People
  -- ^ scheduled sampling of lineages\n  | Occurrence AbsoluteTime Person -- ^ removal
  and observed by not in phylogeny\n  | Disaster AbsoluteTime People -- ^ scheduled
  occurrence of lineages\n  | Extinction -- ^ epidemic went extinct time time can
  be recovered from the preceeding removal\n  | StoppingTime -- ^ the simulation reached
  the stopping time\n  deriving (Show, Generic, Eq)\n```\n\nbecomes\n\n```\n-- | Events
  that can occur in an epidemic with their absolute time.\ndata EpidemicEvent\n  =
  Infection AbsoluteTime Infector Infectee\n  | Removal AbsoluteTime Person\n  | IndividualSample\n
  \     { indSampTime :: AbsoluteTime\n      , indSampPerson :: Person\n      , indSampSeq
  :: Bool\n      }\n  | PopulationSample\n      { popSampTime :: AbsoluteTime\n      ,
  popSampPeople :: People\n      , popSampSeq :: Bool\n      }\n  | Extinction --
  ^ epidemic went extinct time time can be recovered from the preceeding removal\n
  \ | StoppingTime -- ^ the simulation reached the stopping time\n  deriving (Show,
  Generic, Eq)\n```\n \n- Remove CSV export, now there is only JSON export. If you
  want to include an\n  orphan instance for working with `cassava` the following might
  be useful\n\n```\ninstance Csv.ToRecord EpidemicEvent where\n  toRecord e =\n    case
  e of\n      (Infection time person1 person2) ->\n        Csv.record\n          [
  \"infection\"\n          , Csv.toField time\n          , Csv.toField person1\n          ,
  Csv.toField person2\n          ]\n      (Removal time person) ->\n        Csv.record
  [\"removal\", Csv.toField time, Csv.toField person, \"NA\"]\n      (Sampling time
  person) ->\n        Csv.record [\"sampling\", Csv.toField time, Csv.toField person,
  \"NA\"]\n      (Catastrophe time people) ->\n        Csv.record [\"catastrophe\",
  Csv.toField time, Csv.toField people, \"NA\"]\n      (Occurrence time person) ->\n
  \       Csv.record [\"occurrence\", Csv.toField time, Csv.toField person, \"NA\"]\n
  \     (Disaster time people) ->\n        Csv.record [\"disaster\", Csv.toField time,
  Csv.toField people, \"NA\"]\n      Extinction -> Csv.record [\"extinction\", \"NA\",
  \"NA\", \"NA\"]\n      StoppingTime -> Csv.record [\"stop\", \"NA\", \"NA\", \"NA\"]\n```\n\n-
  Move the Newick material into `Epidemic.Types.Newick`.\n- Remvoe the `TransmissionTree`
  and `SampleTree` data types because there is\n  already the `EpidemicTree` and `ReconstructedTree`
  in the\n  `Epidemic.Types.Events` which should be used preferentially.\n- Remove
  dependency on `trifecta` since this functionality is not necessary.\n\n## 0.3.0.0\n\n-
  Add an `ARCHITECTURE.md` file to outline the structure of this package.\n- Move
  all the temporal types into their own submodule `Epidemic.Types.Time` so\n  they
  are easier to isolate.\n- Provide a `Epidemic.Types.Observations` module to provide
  the functionality\n  surrounding extracting the observed events from a simulation.\n-
  Add `Extinction` and `StoppingTime` constructors for the `EpidemicEvent` type\n
  \ so that we can encode why the simulation finished in the events. As a result\n
  \ of this change, every simulation that was not terminated early should end with\n
  \ an `Extinction` event or a `StoppingTime` event.\n- Update the resolver to 17.2\n-
  Extend the `ModelParameters` class to include a `Population` parameter type\n  since
  this is needed to compute event rates in for the logistic model.\n- Create `Epidemic.Type.Simulation`
  module for types relating to running generic\n  simulations from the models to avoid
  confusion as to where these are defined.\n- Move class definitions into corresponding
  `Epidemic.Type.X` modules.\n- Add a `Epidemic.Model.LogisticBDSD` module implementing
  a logistic birth-death\n  process with unscheduled sampling and scheduled unsequenced
  sampling.\n- Move the models into a new `Epidemic.Model` module so that it is clearer
  that\n  these are really just examples of putting together functionality provided
  by\n  the rest of the library.\n- Use a new type `Identifier` to represent identities
  of people rather than a\n  raw integer this way it is clearer what it really is.\n-
  Replace `Time` with `AbsoluteTime` and `TimeDelta` types to make it explicit\n  what
  is being represented.\n- Reduce the number of models that are included to the more
  interesting subset.\n\n## 0.2.2.0\n\n- Clean up for a release candidate.\n\n## 0.2.1.0\n\n-
  Update the stack resolver to `lts-16.17` and add bounds on the package\n  versions
  to use.\n- Remove dependency upon `epi-types` by moving its modules into this package
  and\n  include the tests from that package.\n- Remove unused `Setup.hs` file.\n\n##
  0.2.0.1\n\n- Improve documentation in `Epidemic.BDSCOD`.\n- Upgrade to `epi-types-0.2.1.2`
  for the bug fix.\n\n## 0.2.0.0\n\n- Predicates such as `isSampling` and `isOccurrence`
  have been replaced with\n  clearer named alternatives: `isNonReconTreeObservation`
  and `isReconTreeLeaf`\n  to avoid uncertainty about whether scheduled events are
  included.\n- Upgrade to `epi-types-0.2.1.0` which adds substantial amounts of Newick\n
  \ functionality meaning this can be removed.\n\n## 0.1.9.0\n\n- Upgrade to `epi-types-0.2.0.0`
  which makes a lot of functions redundant so\n  they have been removed.\n\n## 0.1.8.8\n\n-
  Upgrade to `epi-types-0.1.1.1` and remove `joinTimed` since it is no longer\n  needed.\n\n##
  0.1.8.7\n\n- Upgrade to `epi-types-0.1.1.0` and start using the `Timed *` class.\n\n##
  0.1.8.6\n\n- Use `-j2` to slightly improve compilation time.\n- Include a `observedEvents`
  function which was missing from the\n  `InhomogeneousBDS` module.\n\n## 0.1.8.5\n\n-
  Start using cabal directly without hpack.\n- Move time dependent parameters into
  a `epi-sim` package so they are easier to\n  share, and import them here.\n\n##
  0.1.8.4\n\n- Improve documentation of construction of `inhomBDSRates` and include
  a test to\n  check this conforms to expectations.\n- Implement a birth-death-sampling
  model with time-dependent birth rates and\n  include an example of what this returns
  in the README.\n\n## 0.1.8.3\n\n- Improve error handling in `birth-death-lines.R`.\n-
  Refactor some of the plotting code in `birth-death-lines.R` to make it easier\n
  \ to maintain.\n- Use the `future` and `furrr` packages in R to generate the visualisation
  of a\n  simulation in parallel since the serial version is frustratingly slow. Both\n
  \ packages are on CRAN so it does not seem unreasonable.\n\n## 0.1.8.2\n\n- Include
  an additional parameter in the `simulation` and\n  `simulationWithSystemRandom`
  to determine whether the simulation should be\n  conditioned on having at least
  two sampled leaves in the reconstructed tree.\n  It does this by repeatedly simulating
  until such a tree is acheved.\n\n## 0.1.8.1\n\n- Implement an example of the inhomogeneous
  birth-death process and include it\n  in the `README`.\n- Fix broken example using
  the BDSCOD model and organise examples in `examples/`\n  rather than just the single
  one in `app/`.\n\n## 0.1.8.0\n\n- Define an inhomogeneous birth-death process in
  `InhomogeneousBD`.\n- Define an inhomogeneous exponential random sampler using `Timed
  Rate`s.\n- Extend the `ModelParameters` class to have a `birthProb` function.\n-
  Include a `Timed` type for time varying values.\n- Include a test that the final
  size of a birth-death simulation is\n  approximately correct.\n- Format the changelog
  to make it easier to read outside of a browser.\n- Fix naming convention and exports
  in the `BirthDeath`, `BirthDeathSampling`\n  and `BirthDeathSamplingOccurrence`modules
  to conform to the pattern used in\n  the `BDSCOD` module and move `simulation` into
  the `Utility` module since it\n  is common between all models\n- Adjust the type
  of the `ModelParameters` interface to include potential time\n  dependence.\n\n##
  0.1.7.2\n\n- Make `Event` an instance of `FromRecord` to match with `ToRecord`.\n\n##
  0.1.7.1\n\n- Provide `vis/birth-death-lines.R` which visualises a simulation.\n\n##
  0.1.7.0\n\n- Provide `vis/ott.R` to visualise observations through time and make\n
  \ `vis/ltt.R` ignore disasters.\n- Replace some Catastrophe specific functions with
  equivalents for handling\n  scheduled events more generally\n  + `noCatastrophe`
  becomes `noScheduledEvent`\n  + `firstCatastrophe` becomes `firstScheduled`\n- Change
  the naming of the BDSCO model to be consistent with the new BDSCOD\n  model.\n-
  Implement a birth-death-sampling-catastrophe-occurrence-disaster model in\n  `Epidemic.BDSCOD`.\n\n##
  0.1.6.2\n\n- Update the visualisation code in `vis/ltt.R` such that it parses the\n
  \ catastrophe events to draw the LTT.\n- BUG FIX: In the observed events catastrophes
  are replicated when they should\n  not be.\n\n## 0.1.6.1\n\n- Include a visualisation
  script for the LTT of reconstructed trees: `vis/ltt.R`\n  which is described in
  the README.\n\n## 0.1.6.0\n\n- Move the `ToField` declarations into the `Epidemic`
  module to avoid orphaned\n  instance and select a representation for multiple people
  in the CSV output.\n- Implement a birth-death-sampling-catastrophe-occurrence model
  in\n  `Epidemic.BirthDeathSamplingCatastropheOccurrence`; it's a shame about the\n
  \ length of the name.\n- Include a contructor for catastrophe events in which multiple
  people can be\n  sampled simultaneously.\n\n## 0.1.5.1\n\n- Include a `.gitignore`.\n-
  Improved documentation with `haddock`.\n\n## 0.1.5.0\n\n- Include some testing with
  `hspec`.\n- The `Epidemic.BirthDeathSamplingOccurrence` module now has a function
  to\n  extract the observable events.\n- Change the simulation functions to return
  events in the order they occurred.\n- Change the configuration functions to take
  tuples of model parameters.\n\n## 0.1.4.0\n\n- Make `Event` an instance of the `Ord`
  typeclass.\n- Implement types and conversion functions for a `TransmissionTree`
  and a\n  `SampleTree`.\n- Implement a parser and printer for Newick in `Epidemic.Utility`.\n\n##
  0.1.3.0\n\n- Implement a birth-death-sampling-occurrence model in\n  `Epidemic.BirthDeathSamplingOccurrence`.\n-
  Implement a visualisation of the birth-death-sampling LTT in\n  `vis/birthDeathSamplingVisualisation.R`.\n-
  Implement a birth-death-sampling model in `Epidemic.BirthDeathSampling`.\n\n## 0.1.2.0\n\n-
  Implement a visualisation of the infection network in\n  `vis/infection-tree.vg.json`.\n-
  Implement `Epidemic.Utility.eventsAsJsonTree`.\n- Move the `Epidemic.Simulation`
  module to `Epidemic.Utility`.\n\n## 0.1.1.0\n\n- Write the output to CSV using `cassava`\n\n##
  0.1.0.0\n\n- Basic prototype to simulate a constant rate birth-death process.\n"
