  # Changelog for epi-sim

  ## 0.2.2.0

  - Clean up for a release candidate.

  ## 0.2.1.0

  - Update the stack resolver to `lts-16.17` and add bounds on the package
    versions to use.
  - Remove dependency upon `epi-types` by moving its modules into this package and
    include the tests from that package.
  - Remove unsed `Setup.hs` file.

  ## 0.2.0.1

  - Improve documentation in `Epidemic.BDSCOD`.
  - Upgrade to `epi-types-0.2.1.2` for the bug fix.

  ## 0.2.0.0

  - Predicates such as `isSampling` and `isOccurrence` have been replaced with
    clearer named alternatives: `isNonReconTreeObservation` and `isReconTreeLeaf`
    to avoid uncertainty about whether scheduled events are included.
  - Upgrade to `epi-types-0.2.1.0` which adds substantial amounts of Newick
    functionality meaning this can be removed.

  ## 0.1.9.0

  - Upgrade to `epi-types-0.2.0.0` which makes a lot of functions redundant so
    they have been removed.

  ## 0.1.8.8

  - Upgrade to `epi-types-0.1.1.1` and remove `joinTimed` since it is no longer
    needed.

  ## 0.1.8.7

  - Upgrade to `epi-types-0.1.1.0` and start using the `Timed *` class.

  ## 0.1.8.6

  - Use `-j2` to slightly improve compilation time.
  - Include a `observedEvents` function which was missing from the
    `InhomogeneousBDS` module.

  ## 0.1.8.5

  - Start using cabal directly without hpack.
  - Move time dependent parameters into a `epi-sim` package so they are easier to
    share, and import them here.

  ## 0.1.8.4

  - Improve documentation of construction of `inhomBDSRates` and include a test to
    check this conforms to expectations.
  - Implement a birth-death-sampling model with time-dependent birth rates and
    include an example of what this returns in the README.

  ## 0.1.8.3

  - Improve error handling in `birth-death-lines.R`.
  - Refactor some of the plotting code in `birth-death-lines.R` to make it easier
    to maintain.
  - Use the `future` and `furrr` packages in R to generate the visualisation of a
    simulation in parallel since the serial version is frustratingly slow. Both
    packages are on CRAN so it does not seem unreasonable.

  ## 0.1.8.2

  - Include an additional parameter in the `simulation` and
    `simulationWithSystemRandom` to determine whether the simulation should be
    conditioned on having at least two sampled leaves in the reconstructed tree.
    It does this by repeatedly simulating until such a tree is acheved.

  ## 0.1.8.1

  - Implement an example of the inhomogeneous birth-death process and include it
    in the `README`.
  - Fix broken example using the BDSCOD model and organise examples in `examples/`
    rather than just the single one in `app/`.

  ## 0.1.8.0

  - Define an inhomogeneous birth-death process in `InhomogeneousBD`.
  - Define an inhomogeneous exponential random sampler using `Timed Rate`s.
  - Extend the `ModelParameters` class to have a `birthProb` function.
  - Include a `Timed` type for time varying values.
  - Include a test that the final size of a birth-death simulation is
    approximately correct.
  - Format the changelog to make it easier to read outside of a browser.
  - Fix naming convention and exports in the `BirthDeath`, `BirthDeathSampling`
    and `BirthDeathSamplingOccurrence`modules to conform to the pattern used in
    the `BDSCOD` module and move `simulation` into the `Utility` module since it
    is common between all models
  - Adjust the type of the `ModelParameters` interface to include potential time
    dependence.

  ## 0.1.7.2

  - Make `Event` an instance of `FromRecord` to match with `ToRecord`.

  ## 0.1.7.1

  - Provide `vis/birth-death-lines.R` which visualises a simulation.

  ## 0.1.7.0

  - Provide `vis/ott.R` to visualise observations through time and make
    `vis/ltt.R` ignore disasters.
  - Replace some Catastrophe specific functions with equivalents for handling
    scheduled events more generally
    + `noCatastrophe` becomes `noScheduledEvent`
    + `firstCatastrophe` becomes `firstScheduled`
  - Change the naming of the BDSCO model to be consistent with the new BDSCOD
    model.
  - Implement a birth-death-sampling-catastrophe-occurrence-disaster model in
    `Epidemic.BDSCOD`.

  ## 0.1.6.2

  - Update the visualisation code in `vis/ltt.R` such that it parses the
    catastrophe events to draw the LTT.
  - BUG FIX: In the observed events catastrophes are replicated when they should
    not be.

  ## 0.1.6.1

  - Include a visualisation script for the LTT of reconstructed trees: `vis/ltt.R`
    which is described in the README.

  ## 0.1.6.0

  - Move the `ToField` declarations into the `Epidemic` module to avoid orphaned
    instance and select a representation for multiple people in the CSV output.
  - Implement a birth-death-sampling-catastrophe-occurrence model in
    `Epidemic.BirthDeathSamplingCatastropheOccurrence`; it's a shame about the
    length of the name.
  - Include a contructor for catastrophe events in which multiple people can be
    sampled simultaneously.

  ## 0.1.5.1

  - Include a `.gitignore`.
  - Improved documentation with `haddock`.

  ## 0.1.5.0

  - Include some testing with `hspec`.
  - The `Epidemic.BirthDeathSamplingOccurrence` module now has a function to
    extract the observable events.
  - Change the simulation functions to return events in the order they occurred.
  - Change the configuration functions to take tuples of model parameters.

  ## 0.1.4.0

  - Make `Event` an instance of the `Ord` typeclass.
  - Implement types and conversion functions for a `TransmissionTree` and a
    `SampleTree`.
  - Implement a parser and printer for Newick in `Epidemic.Utility`.

  ## 0.1.3.0

  - Implement a birth-death-sampling-occurrence model in
    `Epidemic.BirthDeathSamplingOccurrence`.
  - Implement a visualisation of the birth-death-sampling LTT in
    `vis/birthDeathSamplingVisualisation.R`.
  - Implement a birth-death-sampling model in `Epidemic.BirthDeathSampling`.

  ## 0.1.2.0

  - Implement a visualisation of the infection network in
    `vis/infection-tree.vg.json`.
  - Implement `Epidemic.Utility.eventsAsJsonTree`.
  - Move the `Epidemic.Simulation` module to `Epidemic.Utility`.

  ## 0.1.1.0

  - Write the output to CSV using `cassava`

  ## 0.1.0.0

  - Basic prototype to simulate a constant rate birth-death process.

  # epi-sim
  A library for simulating epidemics, with a focus on phylodynamics and
  observation models.

  ## Available models

  1. Birth-Death (see `Epidemic.BirthDeath`)
  2. Birth-Death-Sampling (see `Epidemic.BirthDeathSampling`)
  3. Birth-Death-Sampling-Occurrence (see `Epidemic.BirthDeathSamplingOccurrence`)
  4. Birth-Death-Sampling-Catastrophe-Occurrence (see `Epidemic.BirthDeathSamplingCatastropheOccurrence`)
  5. Birth-Death-Sampling-Catastrophe-Occurrence-Disaster (see `Epidemic.BDSCOD`)
  6. Inhomogeneous Birth-Death (see `Epidemic.InhomogeneousBD`)
  7. Inhomogeneous Birth-Death-Sampling (see `Epidemic.InhomogeneousBDS`)

  ## Output

  The output is a CSV with a header encoding which events occurred when and to
  whom: `event,time,primaryPerson,secondaryPerson`. The *primary person* is either
  the infecting person or the person who has been removed in some manner, the
  *secondary person* is the person who was infected, or this is a missing value.
  There are functions to assist in extracting observations from a full simulation:
  `birthDeathSamplingOccurrenceObservedEvents`. In the case of a catastrophe event
  where multiple individuals may be removed, they are represented as a colon
  separated list of identifiers in the `primaryPerson` field.
