  2.3 (2013-09-20)

    * These tools now support both epub2 and epub3
    * Documentation changes and additions


  2.2 (2013-04-14)

    * Updated to build against recent changes and bug fixes in
      epub-metadata 3.0
    * All support data files have been brought into the binaries
      now. This makes these tools more tolerant to being moved to a
      different location than what they were configured for build with.
    * Some documentation additions and changes


  2.1.1 (2013-02-03)

    * Fixed a stack overflow problem with some epub documents


  2.1.0 (2013-02-01)

    * Added new subjectMatch command to the DSL, similar to
      authorMatch. This is being primarily used to detect anthology
      publications.
    * Removed some rules that are now handled by anthology detection,
      and fixed relevant unit tests
    * Clarified DSL documentation for authorMatch a little more
    * Modified rules for some magazines to reflect changes to
      recent editions
    * Fixed an error in the DSL documentation
    * Fixed a bug in epubzip where no epub file will be created if
      none already exists


  2.0.0 (2012-10-31)

    * Major redesign of the formatting rules system. Renaming
      machinery is now described in a domain-specific language,
      NOT in statically compiled code. Users are able to extend the
      functionality with custom naming rules in conf files.
    * Added interactive mode to ask about each file rename as they
      happen, this is like darcs now!
    * Added ability to specify target directory for books to be
      moved to as part of renaming. Includes code to check that target
      directory exists.
    * Removed --overwrite option. Turns out, renameFile has always
      been smart enough to not overwrite existing.
    * Added / character to filters, a big no-no character for file
      paths on most sane filesystems
    * Publication year was looking for publication before
      original-publication, causing problems in books that have
      both tags
    * Miscellaneous rules changes for various publications


  1.1.2 (2012-01-29)

    * Changed how this code provides epub zip file contents as a
      ByteString to the epub-metadata library. Need to read this data
      strictly to avoid dangling open files.
    * Corrected for breakage due to change in title format of Eclipse magazine
    * Some work done on the utility script for deploying Windows
      binaries of these tools
    * Added parsing support and test cases for more date formats
    * Minor usage info changes


  1.1.1 (2011-11-15)

    * Changed how publication date is found to more closely follow
      the OPF spec recommendations
    * Changed the switches related to publication date
    * Redesigned unit test code and added more tests for new date code


  1.1.0 (2011-11-04)

    * Huge redesign of how formatting works, dramatically shortening
      the code needed to handle any given book type. Code is much more
      monadic now and consolidated into one module.
    * Many changes/additions to magazine and compilation book name
      formatting
    * Fixed a group of bugs that occur when a creator has only a
      single word for their name
    * Extensive changes/additions to unit testing for above


  1.0.0.1 (2011-10-27)

    * Extensive changes to the cabal build of this project to bring
      it up to Cabal 1.10
    * Unit tests now use the test-suite cabal stanza

  ## Synopsis

  Command line utilities for working with epub files (Haskell)


  ## Description

  A suite of command-line utilities for creating and manipulating epub book files. Included are: epubmeta, epubname, epubzip. This software uses the epub-metadata library, also available on Hackage.

  ### epubmeta

  epubmeta is a command-line utility for examining and editing epub book metadata. With it you can export, import and edit the raw OPF Package XML document for a given book. Or simply dump the metadata to stdout for viewing in a friendly format.

  Here's an example of epubmeta output:

        $ epubmeta Kelly_Kessel_Lethem-NinetyPercentOfEverything.epub

        package
           version: 2.0
           unique-identifier: calibre_id
        identifier
           id: calibre_id
           scheme: calibre
           text: b1026732-69a5-4a05-a8d9-a1701685f6fa
        identifier
           scheme: ISBN
           text: 1-590620-00-3
        title: Ninety Percent of Everything
        language: en-us
        contributor
           text: calibre (0.5.1) [http://calibre.kovidgoyal.net]
           file-as: calibre
           role: bkp
        creator
           text: James Patrick Kelly
           file-as: Kelly, James Patrick
           role: aut
        creator
           text: John Kessel
           role: aut
        creator
           text: Jonathan Lethem
           role: aut
        date: 2001-03-25T00:00:00
        publisher: www.Fictionwise.com
        subject: Science Fiction/Fantasy

  ### epubname

  epubname is a command-line utility for renaming epub ebook files based on their OPF Package metadata. It tries to use author names and title info to construct a sensible name.

  Using it looks like this:

        $ epubname poorly-named-book.epub

        poorly-named-book.epub -> WattsPeter-Blindsight_2006.epub

        $ epubname another-poorly-named-book.epub

        another-poorly-named-book.epub -> Kelly_Kessel_Lethem-NinetyPercentOfEverything.epub

  ### epubzip

  epubzip is a handy utility for zipping up the files that comprise an epub into an .epub zip file. Using the same technology as epubname, it can try to make a meaningful filename for the book.
