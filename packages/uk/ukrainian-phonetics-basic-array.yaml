changelog: "# Revision history for ukrainian-phonetics-basic-array\n\n## 0.1.0.0 --
  2020-12-14\n\n* First version. Released on an unsuspecting world. A fork of the
  ukrainian-phonetics-basic package that transformed into\nan independent one. All
  the vector-related functionality has been removed.\n\n## 0.1.1.0 -- 2020-12-18\n\n*
  First version revised A. Changed the dependency boundaries to fix the array usage
  issue. Please, update to the new\nversion to avoid the misusage.\n\n## 0.1.2.0 --
  2021-01-27\n\n* First version revised B. Added new variants of the sound representation
  durations to the Languages.Phonetic.Ukrainian.Syllable.Double.Arr and Languages.Phonetic.Ukrainian.Syllable.Arr
  modules.\nSome documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.2.0.0 -- 2021-10-30\n\n* Second
  version. Switched to the Case.Hashable.Cuckoo.getBFstL' function where possible.
  Updated the dependencies.\n\n## 0.3.0.0 -- 2021-10-31\n\n* Third version. Switched
  back to the CaseBi.Arr.getBFstLSorted' functionality.\n\n## 0.4.0.0 -- 2021-11-03\n\n*
  Fourth version. Added Int8-based optimized functionality.The modules that do not
  use Int8 after ugrading the\nphonetic-languages-simplified-examples-array to the
  Int8-based functionality are planned to be moved to a new package.\n\n## 0.4.1.0
  -- 2021-11-04\n\n* Fourth version revised A. Some documentation improvements. Moved
  the new modules with Int8 functionality without ByteString\nrelated functionality
  to the new location path without ByteString folder.\n\n## 0.4.2.0 -- 2021-11-05\n\n*
  Fourth version revised B. Removed the inlining in the new modules to make them similar
  to the previous ones. Probably it\nled to not optimized compiling of the further
  code using this ones.\n\n## 0.5.0.0 -- 2022-02-19\n\n* Fifth version. Some code
  optimizations and improvements (mostly) in speed. Moved the functionality to the
  2 new packages: \nukrainian-phonetics-common and ukranian-phonetics-basic-array-bytestring.
  Added new tuples-based functionality.\n\n## 0.5.1.0 -- 2022-02-21\n\n* Fifth version
  revised A. Fixed issues with the similarly defined sDurat4 and sDurat3 functions.
  Some code improvements. \nAdded extended versions of the functions to the Languages.Phonetic.Ukrainian.Syllable.ArrInt8
  module.\n\n"

description: Rewritten from the mmsyn6ukr and mmsyn7s packages. Comparing to the ukrainian-phonetics-basic
  package, all the vector-related functionality removed, it also removed from the
  dependencies and the mmsyn2 is changed to mmsyn2-array. Since 0.4.0.0 version switched
  to the more optimized Int8-based functionality. The modules that do not use Int8
  after ugrading the phonetic-languages-simplified-examples-array to the Int8-based
  functionality are planned to be moved to the new package.
