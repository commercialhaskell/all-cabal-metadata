  the recorded informational sound file in the 'recAndProcess' function.\n\n## 0.5.3.0
  -- 2020-03-07\n\n* Fifth version revised C. Fixed issue with the noise reduction
  in the 'recAndProcess' function for the existing at the beginning file\n(it is not
  done at all in such a case). \n\n## 0.6.1.0 -- 2020-03-08\n\n* Sixth version revised
  A. Fixed issue with 'signsFromString' function that leads to performance penalty
  and to cycling. \n\n## 0.7.0.0 -- 2020-03-10\n\n* Seventh version. Added new explicit
  dependency (mmsyn2) that earlier was implicit. Added the opportunity to define in
  how many times the amplitude\nfor the second lower note is greater than for the

  code improvements that give more stability. Documentation improvement.\n\n## 0.9.0.0
  -- 2020-03-13\n\n* Ninth version. Changed the module structure to four modules.
  Added new functions in the DobutokO.Sound.Functional module to filter possible beats.
  Changed some\nexports for DobutokO.Sound module.\n\n## 0.9.1.0 -- 2020-03-14\n\n*
  Ninth version revised A. Removed two functions from DobutokO.Sound.Functional module
  because of their inefficient work that leads to very long\n(possibly infinitely)
  computation. \n\n## 0.10.0.0 -- 2020-03-14\n\n* Tenth version. Added again the possibility
  to filter possible beats. Added new simple functions that are likely to work with
  previously prepared\nVector (Double, Double) that satisfies some constraints. Some
  documentation imrovement. Some performance optimizations.\n\n## 0.10.1.0 -- 2020-03-14\n\n*
  Tenth version revised A. Some documentation improvements. Some performance optimizations.\n\n##
  0.11.0.0 -- 2020-03-16\n\n* Eleventh version. Added a second executable O2help that
  can be used to convert multiline Ukrainian text input to the needed String for the
  dobutokO2\nprogram. Rewritten DobutokO.Sound.Executable module to provide more modularity.
  \n\n## 0.11.0.1 -- 2020-03-16\n\n* Eleventh version revised A. Some documentation
  improvement of README.markdown file.\n\n## 0.11.1.0 -- 2020-03-16\n\n* Eleventh
  version revised B. Inserted the functionality of the second auxiliary executable
  O2help into the single one -- dobutokO2 with \"0\" first command\nline option. Changed
  the information in the README.markdown file appropriately.\n\n## 0.11.2.0 -- 2020-03-16\n\n*
  Eleventh version revised C. Fixed issue with being not compiled because of not properly
  defined arguments for a function 'o2help'\nin the DobutokO.Sound.Executable module.\n\n##
  0.12.0.0 -- 2020-03-17\n\n* Twelfth version. Added a possibility to produce sound
  in the dobutokO2 function with only one input provided for the first command line
  option \"7\". Made\nfunctions in the DobutokO.Sound.Executable module more modular
  so this grows a possibility to reuse them. Added new functions for the new functionality.
  Some\ndocumentation improvements. Added as additional file \"text.dat.txt\" an example
  of the configuration for \"7\" first command line input. \n\n## 0.13.0.0 -- 2020-03-18\n\n*
  Thirteenth version. Fixed issues connected with that SoX is by default for some
  distributions unable to work with a quantity of given files significantly more\nthan
  1000. This led to that the program and functions could not work properly with some
  big amounts of data or sound data source files of some sizes. Now the\nprogram and
  library work with them in a much more stable manner using temporary additional files.
  Some documentation, code and export improvements.\n\n## 0.14.0.0 -- 2020-03-19\n\n*
  Fourteenth version. Fixed issues connected with unneeded empty extensionless intermediate
  files in the current directory. Added the possibility to create\nthe resulting \"end.wav\"
  file and to clean the disk space from \"result*\" files by adding two new first
  command line options \"8\" and \"80\". Please, use the last\none with a special
  attention. See README.markdown for more information. Fixed issues with negative
  frequencies and durations possible in the\nDobutokO.Sound.Functional functions.
  Added some more error messages to make debugging easier.\n\n## 0.15.0.0 -- 2020-03-20\n\n*
  Fifteenth version. Added an opportunity to work not only with octaves but also with
  n-th elements sets of consequential notes with the variants\nof 2, 3, 4, 6, or 9
  notes. Octave from such a perspective is a set of 12 notes. Some documentation improvements
  for the README.markdown file.\n\n## 0.15.1.0 -- 2020-03-20\n\n* Fifteenth version
  revised A. Fixed issue with the wrong mapping between the first command line arguments
  and the executable behaviour. Added the needed\nbehaviour for the \"61\" first command
  line option. Some improvement for the README.markdown file.\n\n## 0.16.0.0 -- 2020-03-23\n\n*
  Sixteenth version. Changed dependency version for directory package. Some documentation
  improvements for README.markdown file. Added a new module\nDobutokO.Sound.IntermediateF
  to work with intermediate files. Changed the names of the some functions in DobutokO.Sound
  module and its exports.\n\n## 0.17.0.0 -- 2020-03-25\n\n* Seventeenth version. Added
  a few functions ('reverbE', 'reverb1E' etc.) to work with SoX effects to DobutokO.Sound.IntermediateF
  module. Added some additional\ninformation in a dobutokO2.cabal file.\n\n## 0.17.1.0
  -- 2020-03-25\n\n* Seventeenth version revised A. Fixed issues with being not compiled
  and duplicate export in 'DobutokO.Sound.IntermediateF'. Added two new functions\n'soxE'
  and 'soxE1'. \n\n## 0.18.0.0 -- 2020-03-26\n\n* Eighteenth version. Added three
  new functions to the DobutokO.Sound.IntermediateF module for recording and playing
  of the files.\nSome documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.19.0.0 -- 2020-03-27\n\n*
  Nineteenth version. Added a new module DobutokO.Sound.ParseList to parse entered
  list of Int. Added the possibility to use \"99\" and \"999\" first command line\noptions
  that allows to play and edit with SoX effects applied respectively the sequence
  of the \"result\\*wav\" files in the current directory. Added functions\nto realize
  the functionality to different modules. Some documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.19.1.0
  -- 2020-03-28\n\n* Nineteenth version revised A. Fixed issue with the infinite lists
  and thus the divergent functions. Changed some functions and fulfilled them with
  a limitation\nparameter. Some minor documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.20.0.0 --
  2020-03-28\n\n* Twentieth version. Improved behaviour of the functions in the DobutokO.Sound.Functional
  module. Added new functions to produce melodies. Some minor\ndocumentation improvements.\n\n##
  0.21.0.0 -- 2020-03-30\n\n* Twenty-first version. Starting from the version 0.21.0.0
  the package extends its library functions with the possibility to create not only\nsingle
  notes or intervals of sounds playing simultaneously but also sets of three, four,
  five, six, seven or more sounds played simultanously\nwith their obertones. For
  more information, please, refer to the documentation for the DobutokO.Sound.Functional
  module. Added the needed functionality\nfor this. Rearrange modules DobutokO.Sound
  and DobutokO.Sound.Functional to provide more flexibility and shorten the code.
  Added new generalized functions\nto the DobutokO.Sound.Functional module. Some documentation
  improvements.\n\n## 0.22.0.0 -- 2020-04-02\n\n* Twenty-second version. Added 1G
  generalized functions to the DobutokO.Sound.Functional module. They allow additional
  volume adjustment in dB given by\nan additional vector of Double values for the
  overtones. Changed the names of the functions and documentation from 'ober' ('Ober')
  to English 'over'\n('Over'). Fixed issue with 'partialTest_k' function for being
  not generated overtones files for the indices that can be without a remainder divided
  by\n50. Some code and documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.22.1.0 -- 2020-04-02\n\n*

  1G) functions\nto the same modules. Some code and documentation improvements. Added
  new command line options with \"2\" at the end.\n\n## 0.24.0.0 -- 2020-04-04\n\n*
  Twenty-fourth version. Fixed issue with being not compiled because of the unsupported
  operator (<$>) for GHC 7.8.4. Added possibilities to\nwork with DobutokO.Sound.Functional
  module function f more explicitly by three functions 'maybeFFromStrVec', 'fVecCoefs'
  and 'showFFromStrVec'. Provided\ninformation about examples in the GitHub repository
  dobutokO2-examples. Some code and documentation improvements. \n\n## 0.24.1.0 --
  2020-04-04\n\n* Twenty-fourth version revised A. Fixed issue with being not compiled

description: "A program and a library to create experimental music from\na mono audio
  and a Ukrainian text. It can also create a timbre\nfor the notes.\n\n                *****
  Usage *****\n                -----------------\n\nYou can use it as a library or
  as an executable.\n\nPlease, check before executing whether there is no \"x.wav\",
  \"test\\*.wav\",\n\"result\\*.wav\" and \"end.wav\" files in the current directory,
  because they\ncan be overwritten. The same can be said about \"nx\\*.wav\" files
  in the directory.\n\nFor the executable you enter in the terminal:\n\ndobutokO2
  { 0 | 1 | 11 | 2 | 21 | 3 | 31 | 4 | 41 | 5 | 51 | 6 | 7 } {fileName} {Ukrainian
  text}\n\nOR:\n\ndobutokO2 { 8 | 80 | 9 | 99 | 999 }\n\nOR:\n\ndobutokO2 { 82 | 820
  | 92 | 992 | 9992 } {volatile symbols together, e. g. \"0\"} {quality control, see
  information below}\n\nOR:\n\ndobutokO2 00 {beginning symbols for the filenames \"fade\"
  effect to be applied to} {quality control, see information below}\n\n  where filename
  is:\n  the full name of the file to be recorded in the current directory or\n  the
  full absolute path to the sound .wav file (or other one format\n  that is supported
  by your SoX installation) to obtain sound information from.\n\nIf the first command
  line argument equals to one of the numbers below, then\nthe program behaves as follows:\n\n
  \ \"1\", or \"3\", or \"5\" ->  then the executable uses the overTones functions,\n
  \   so for the given parameters the overtones are the same for every call.\n\n  \"2\",
  or \"4\", or \"6\" -> then the program uses uniqOverTones functions.\n\n  \"3\",
  or \"4\", or \"5\", or \"6\" -> the program uses additional String to define\n    signs
  for the harmonics coefficients for overtones.\n\n  \"11\", or \"21\", or \"31\",
  or \"41\", or \"51\", or \"61\" -> the program works as for\n     the respective
  inputs with only the first character in the option\n       (e. g. for \"51\", this
  is \"5\"), but uses not octaves, but n-th elements sets\n         of consequential
  notes consisting of 2, 3, 4, 6, or 9 elements (called\n           'enky'). The usual
  octave is from such point of view a 12th elements set\n             of consequential
  notes. This allows to create more 'condensed' and\n               'narrower' compositions
  that being more defined can be at the\n                 same time more precise.\n\n
  \ \"9\" -> the program works with existing \"result\\*.wav\" files and you can replace\n
  \    some of them by other one(s) or their sequences. This allows to create files,\n
  \      then edit them using this first command line option (possibly for several\n
  \        times) and at last create a resulting melody file with \"8\" or \"80\"
  options.\n\n  \"99\" -> the program takes a filename (it is a first command line
  argument and it is\n     ignored) and the rest of the command line argument (they
  are treated as command\n       line arguments to the SoX 'play' command). Then the
  program prompts you to\n         specify the needed indeces for the \"result\\*.wav\"
  files in the current\n           directory (e. g. they can be obtained by executing
  the dobutokO2 with\n             the first command line argument less than \"8\",
  or produced by some\n               other means). You can specify multiple lists
  of Int to select the\n                 needed files to be played with effects. Afterwards,
  the program\n                   just plays these selected files applying the specified
  SoX\n                     effects to them consequently. For example:\n    dobutokO2
  9 reverb -w\n                       will play the selected (during execution) files
  with the\n                         SoX \"reverb -w\" effect. For more information
  on effects,\n                           please, refer to the SoX documentation.\n\n
  \ \"999\" -> similarly to \"99\", but instead of playing the files, SoX actually\n
  \     applies to them these effects and overwrites the files with the obtained ones.\n
  \       It is convenient way to test the sounding effects with firstly run the\n
  \         dobutokO2 with \"99\" first command line argument, and then, if suitable,\n
  \           with \"999\" one. Be aware, that after running with the latter one,
  the\n              program cannot restore the files that were changed to their previous\n
  \               state, so be careful while running.\n                           \n
  \ In more details:\n\n  \"0\" -> the program just converts multiline Ukrainian text
  from stdin\n     into a String and prints it to stdout. No other arguments are used.\n\n
  \ \"00\" -> the program applies \"fade q 0.01 -0.0\" SoX effect to every \"zs\\*.wav\"\n
  \    (or instead of them to every \"zs\\*.flac\") file in the current directory.
  \n       The 'zs' here is specified by the second command line argument.\n        This
  allows to avoid clipping while just simply concatenating the files into\n          one
  with SoX. The mentioned clipping can be desirable in some circumstances\n            but
  generally is not necessary or is redundant. For more information,\n              please,
  refer to the SoX documentation and to that one for 'fadeAllE'\n                function
  in the DobutokO.Sound.IntermediateF module.\n\n  \"1\" -> basic functionality without
  the possibility to define individual overtones.\n\n  \"11\" -> the same as \"1\",
  but works with enky. See general information above.\n  \n  \"2\" -> basic functionality
  with the possibility to define individual overtones.\n     In such a case, another
  text gives the other overtones.\n\n  \"21\" -> the same as \"2\", but works with
  enky. See general information above.\n\n  \"3\" -> adittionally to basic functionality
  gives an opportunity \n     to specify the signs for the harmonics coefficients
  for overtones\n       by additional String.\n\n  \"31\" -> the same as \"3\", but
  works with enky. See general information above.\n\n  \"4\" -> similarly to \"2\"
  gives an opportunity to specify the signs\n     for the harmonics coefficients for
  overtones by additional String.\n\n  \"41\" -> the same as \"4\", but works with
  enky. See general information above.\n\n  \"5\" -> additionally to that one functionality
  provided by \"3\" gives\n     an opportunity to specify in how many times the amplitude
  for\n       the second lower note (if any) is greater, than the amplitude\n         for
  the main note and specify the intervals to be used\n           for every note.\n\n
  \ \"51\" -> the same as \"5\", but works with enky. See general information above.\n\n
  \ \"6\" -> the same as \"5\", but you can define also overtones by an additional
  String.\n\n  \"61\" -> the same as \"6\", but works with enky. See general information
  above.\n\n  \"7\" -> the program behaves like for the \"5\" option, but generates\n
  \    overtones using additional String and allows maximum control over\n       the
  parameters. Besides, all the needed information it obtains from\n         the singular
  formatted input, which can be ended with a keyboard keys\n           combination
  that means an end of input (e. g. for Unices, that is\n             probably Ctrl
  + D). '@' are separators for the input parts\n               for their respective
  parts. For more information about the\n                 format of the single input,
  see:\n        https://drive.google.com/open?id=10Z_GRZR4TKoL5KXfqPm-t-4humuHN0O4\n
  \                 The file is also provided with the package as text.dat.txt.\n
  \                  The last two or three inputs (an input just here means\n                     a
  textual input between two '@') can be omitted, the\n                       program
  will work also but with less control for\n                         the user possible.\n\n
  \  \"8\" -> the program just creates from input \"result\\*\" files the \"end.wav\"
  by\n     concatenating them into one. It is mostly useful after some processment\n
  \      on the \"result\\*\" files after previous execution with other lesser first\n
  \        command line arguments to get the test final sound file. It can be then\n
  \          listened to and probably remade again by editing the \"result\\*\" files\n
  \            and running the program with this option again. In such a case,\n               none
  from the other command line arguments is important for the\n                 program
  running, so they all can be simply omitted.\n\n   \"80\" -> the same as \"8\" but
  with one important difference that the program if\n     succeeded in creation of
  the \"end.wav\" file, then removes all other \"result\\*\"\n       files from the
  current directory, so you cannot reverse the successful action\n         back and
  try again with just the same files. In such a case, you need to\n           repeat
  all the process of creation of \"result\\*\" files. Be aware and use\n             with
  care!\n\n  \"82\" -> the same as \"8\", but you can specify the sound quality parameters
  for the\n     resulted file and choose whether it will be in WAV or FLAC format.
  To specify\n       this additional processing information, use as a third command
  line argument\n          (after the first \"82\" and the volatile second one) 4
  consequent symbols:\n            3 digits and 1 letter ('f' -- for FLAC one and
  'w' for WAV one). The first\n              two digits are a code for rate and the
  third one -- a code for bit depth\n                ('1' -- for 16 bit and '2' --
  for 24 bit). The list of possible first\n                  two digits and their
  corresponding frequency rate in Hz:\n\n                     \"11\" -> 11025\n\n
  \                    \"16\" -> 16000\n\n                     \"17\" -> 176400\n\n
  \                    \"19\" -> 192000\n\n                     \"32\" -> 32000\n\n
  \                    \"44\" -> 44100\n\n                     \"48\" -> 48000\n\n
  \                    \"80\" -> 8000\n\n                     \"96\" -> 96000\n\n
  \                    The default one behaviour is equivalent to \"221w\".\n\n  \"820\"
  -> the same as \"80\", but similarly to \"82\" it gives you the opportunity to\n
  \     specify sound quality parameters in just the same way.\n\n  \"9\", \"99\",
  or \"999\" -> see the information above.\n\n  \"92\", \"992\", or \"9992\" -> similar
  to the above line, but with the opportunity to\n      specify sound quality parameters
  in just the same way as for \"82\" option.\n         These are considered still
  highly experimental and not well tested,\n            so use them not for production.\n
  \          \n   _  -> the program behaves like for the \"5\" option, but generates\n
  \    overtones using additional String and allows maximum control over\n        the
  parameters.\n\nAfter the program executing (it takes some time) with the first command
  line\noptions except \"80\" there are files \"result\\*.wav\" in the directory.\nThese
  are the resulting melody generated in their order preserved.\n\nThe program now
  lifts the frequencies to the octave or to the enka with the number,\nwhich you can
  specify during its execution.\n\nYou can use the default values (backward compatible
  with the 0.2.0.0 version \nif the first command line option does not consist of
  two digits and the last one\nis not a '0' or '1') by simply pressing 'Enter' while
  being prompted and\nthe informational message contains the line about the default
  value.\n\nSince the 0.21.0.0 version the package extends its library functions with\nthe
  possibility to create not only single notes or intervals of sounds playing\nsimultaneously
  but also sets of three, four, five, six, seven or more sounds\nplayed simultaneously
  with their overtones. For more information, please, refer\nto the documentation
  for the DobutokO.Sound.Functional module.\n\nSince the 0.22.1.0 version the library
  functions are extended also with the\npossibility to adjust volume for the overtones
  using generalized functions '1G'\nwith adjustment being represented in dB. For more
  information, please, refer\nto the documentation for the DobutokO.Sound.Functional
  module.\n\nSince the 0.23.0.0 version the library includes functions '2G': generalized\nones
  in the DobutokO.Sound.Functional, and DobutokO.Sound.IntermediateF, and\nDobutokO.Sound.Executable
  modules. They allow to specify sound quality\nof the resulting files using additional
  parameter.\n\nSince the 0.24.0.0 version the library includes functions to work
  more explicitly\nwith f function in the DobutokO.Sound.Functional module. They are
  based on the\nsimplest (but still meaningful) multiplicative data fitting.\n\n**
  Note:\n\n* Better to execute in the RAM. Need rather a lot of space on the disk
  for\nthe resulting file \"end.wav\" and auxiliary files (MBs) for a short sound\nin
  the second command line arguments.\n\n                ***** Examples *****\n                --------------------\n\nStarting
  from the 0.24.0.0 version, you can refer to examples in the GitHub special\nrepository
  (https://github.com/OleksandrZhabenko/dobutokO2-examples/). \nYou can also see some
  of the generated sounds on the YouTube list:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuG3zSZWV7yollV9nMPcRtm3udVuYVlFS\n\n\n
  \               ***** Support for not Sound File Variativity Sources *****\n                ----------------------------------------------------------\n
  \               \nSince 0.28.0.0 version the library supports not only the sound
  file as a \nvariativity source but also other types of files. They are used through
  \na special reencoding using lazy bytestrings. For more information, please, \nrefer
  to DobutokO.Sound.Keyboard module.                \n\n"
