  # doctemplates

  ## 0.7.2

    * Add `nowrap` filter.

    * Improve `alpha`, `roman`, `uppercase`, `lowercase` filters so they
      apply recursively within a list or map.

    * Allow `for` loops to bind map value.  In this case there is no
      iteration, but the anophoric variable 'it' is assigned, which may
      help in using filters that destructure a string into a map (if
      we add any).

  ## 0.7.1

    * Add `chomp` filter.

    * Allow filters to be applied to output of partials.

  ## 0.7

    * Add haddock Makefile target, which regenerates haddocks from README
      and tests the code example.

    * Remove `BreakingSpace` constructor on `Template`.
      Now we use doclayout `BreakingSpace` inside a `Literal`.

    * Add instance for `ToContext a (Doc a)`.

    * Get benchmarks compiling again.

    * Use (doclayout) `Doc` internally and for rendered output.

      + `TemplateTarget` is now a type constraint synonym, not a regular
        typeclass.
      + Constraint on `compileTemplate` and `applyTemplate`
        simplified using TemplateTarget.
      + DocTemplates reexports Text.DocLayout.Doc.
      + The `Literal` costructor of `Template` now takes a `Doc a`
        rather than an `a`.
      + The `SimpleVal` constructor of `Val` now takes a `Doc a`
        rather than an `a`.
      + `renderTemplate` now returns a `Doc a` rather than an `a`.
        (This value can be converted to an a using `render Nothing`.)

    * Remove fromText from `TemplateTarget`.  Now we use `fromString`
      from Data.String.

    * Parameterize `Template` on underlying stringlike type.

    * Improved behavior of partials.

    * Improve indent functions: don't drop final newline.

    * Allow blank lines in nested section.

    * Indent for Text/String: don't indent empty lines.

    * Additional tests and documentation about nesting.

    * Render items in for loop before separator.
      Otherwise we throw off column calculation.

    * Remove `+-reflow`; replace with toggle `$~$`.

    * Remove pNewline parser; it isn't needed now.

    * Remove `+-nest`.

    * Fix nest parsing bug.

    * Improve nesting.

      + Change `Nested` constructor for `Template` so it doesn't take
        a parameter.
      + Nesting level is now determined dynamically at render time
        rather than at compile time.  This gives much better results
        when nesting occurs after template directives.
        Benchmarks show a slight penalty in performance (from 3.5ms to 3.1ms
        in rendering), but it's not too much.

    * Add filters. Filters transform the value of a variable, e.g. changing
      a map into an array of key/value pairs.  Closes #5.

      + Internal: Add `Filter` type and `[Filter]` parameter on `Variable`.
      + Remove `unVariable`; now we have `varParts` and `varFilters`.
      + Document filters in README.md.
      + Implement filters.
      + Add tests.

    * Add `ToYAML`, `FromYAML` instances for `Context`, `Val`.

  ## 0.6.2

    * Remove unnecessary `TemplateTarget` constraints on
      `ToContext` instances.

    * Add `ToContext` instance for `Map Text a`.

    * Add `Data`, `Typeable` instances for `Context` and `Val`.

  ## 0.6.1

    * Indent bare partials.

  ## 0.6

    * Add `+nest`/`-nest` keywords.

    * Add `+reflow`/`-reflow` keywords.

    * Add Nested constructor to Template, remove Indented
      and Indented parameter for Interpolate.

    * More expansive description of library.

  ## 0.5.1

    * Add elseif keyword.

    * Improve compile error source locations with partials.

    * Handle templates that don't end in newlines.  Previously
      this caused problems in some cases.

  ## 0.5

    * Add toText method to TemplateTarget class.

    * Add String and Lazy Text instances for TemplateTarget.

    * Swap Parameters in ToContext (so that the first parameter
      for both ToContext and FromContext refers to the parameter
      of Context).

    * Add toVal method to ToContext.

    * Default instance definition for toContext in terms of toVal,
      so that defining toVal is sufficient.

    * Add instances for ToContext and FromContext.

    * Remove valueToContext. Add ToJSON, FromJSON instances
      for Context and Val instead.

    * isEmpty: For Doc, treat `Text 0 _` as empty.
      Also `Concat x y` when x and y are empty.
      This differs from isEmpty in DocLayout itself, which only
      applies to Empty.

    * Code cleanup.

  ## 0.4

    * Split into three modules.  Main module only exports an
      opaque version of the Template type.  Import Internal if you
      need to manipulate a Template.

    * Add Context type, parameterized on the underlying content's type.

    * Add Val type.

    * Add valueToContext for converting an Aeson Value to a Context.

    * Make renderTemplate and applyTemplate polymorphic in both
      context and target.  Context parameter is now any instance
      of ToContext (instead of ToJSON).  Result is now any
      instance of TemplateTarget.

    * Change type of getPartial in TemplateMonad so it runs in the
      TemplateMonad instance, not the Parser.  Return a simple
      value rather than an Either; error handling can vary with
      the monad.

    * Remove TemplatePart. Template is now an algebraci data type,
      not a list of TemplateParts.

    * Add an Indented type to indicate indentation for
      interpolated variables.

    * Improve architecture, doing more at compile time.

    * Depend on doclayout.  Context can be parameterized on a doclayout
      Doc type, allowing intelligent reflowing of content.

    * Remove single final newline in interpolated variable.

    * Remove final newline from partial.

    * Don't iterate when the variable evaluates to NullVal.

    * Only indented interpolated variables if by themselves on line.

    * Add Indented parameter to Interpolate constructor.

    * Update documentation and haddocks.

    * Add benchmark.

  ## 0.3.0.1

  * Bump lower bound on base to 4.9, drop support for ghc 7.10.

  * Add needed import for older base versions.

  * Add test.hs to repository.

  ## 0.3

  * Note that all of the changes to template syntax described
    below are backwards compatible, and all old pandoc templates
    should continue to work as before.

  * Allow `${...}` style delimiters around variables and
    directives, in addition to `$...$`.  Allow space around
    the delimiters.

  * Support `$it$` as a variable for the current value in
    an iteration.  (The old method, where the containing
    variable name is used, still works.)

  * Support partials (subtemplates defined in different files).

  * Interpolated array variables now have all elements rendered,
    concatenated, with an optional separator that can be
    specified using a new bracketed syntax.

  * Remove `TemplateTarget` class.  It was pointless; the
    calling program can just do these trivial transformations.
    Avoids dependencies on bytestring, blaze-html, blaze-markup.

  * Change type of `renderTemplate` and `applyTemplate` to produce
    a `Text`, instead of being polymorphic.

  * Changed type of `compileTemplate`: it now takes a
    template path and the template contents, and returns
    either a template or an error.  It runs in an instance
    of `TemplateMonad`, which is an abstraction around different
    ways of getting partials.  (For example, in IO we can get
    partials by reading them from a file system, but in a
    web application one might want to obtain them from the
    database or have a set of them baked in.)

  * Remove `varListToJSON`.

  * Changed the architecture: `Template` is no longer just
    a newtype around a function, but a list of `TemplatePart`s.

  * Added a newtype for `Variable`.

  * Improved documentation in README.md.

  * Added a new test framework and much more extensive tests.

  # doctemplates

  [![CI
  tests](https://github.com/jgm/doctemplates/workflows/CI%20tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jgm/doctemplates/actions)


  This is the text templating system used by pandoc.  Its basic function is to
  fill variables in a template.  Variables are provided by a "context."
  Any instance of the `ToContext` typeclass (such as an aeson `Value`)
  can serve as the context, or a `Context` value can be constructed manually.

  Control structures are provided to test whether a variable has a non-blank
  value and to iterate over the items of a list.  Partials---that is,
  subtemplates defined in different files---are supported.  Filters
  can be used to transform the values of variables or partials.
  The provided filters make it possible to do list enumeration and
  tabular layout in templates.

  Templates are rendered to a doclayout `Doc` (which is polymorphic
  in the underlying string type). If `Doc` values are used in the
  context, rendered documents will be able to wrap flexibly on breaking
  spaces.  This feature makes doctemplates more suitable than other
  template engines for plain-text formats (like Markdown).

  Unlike the various HTML-centered template engines, doctemplates is
  output-format agnostic, so no automatic escaping is done on interpolated
  values.  Values are assumed to be escaped properly in the Context.

  ## Example of use

  ``` haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
  import Data.Text (Text)
  import qualified Data.Text.IO as T
  import Data.Aeson
  import Text.DocTemplates
  import Text.DocLayout (render)

  data Employee = Employee { firstName :: String
                           , lastName  :: String
                           , salary    :: Maybe Int }
  instance ToJSON Employee where
    toJSON e = object [ "name" .= object [ "first" .= firstName e
                                         , "last"  .= lastName e ]
                      , "salary" .= salary e ]

  template :: Text
  template = "$for(employee)$Hi, $employee.name.first$. $if(employee.salary)$You make $employee.salary$.$else$No salary data.$endif$$sep$\n$endfor$"

  main :: IO ()
  main = do
    res <- compileTemplate "mytemplate.txt" template
    case res of
           Left e    -> error e
           Right t   -> T.putStrLn $ render Nothing $ renderTemplate t $ object
                          ["employee" .=
                            [ Employee "John" "Doe" Nothing
                            , Employee "Omar" "Smith" (Just 30000)
                            , Employee "Sara" "Chen" (Just 60000) ]
                          ]
  ```

  ## Delimiters

  To mark variables and control structures in the template,
  either `$`...`$` or `${`...`}` may be used as delimiters.
  The styles may also be mixed in the same template, but the
  opening and closing delimiter must match in each case.  The
  opening delimiter may be followed by one or more spaces
  or tabs, which will be ignored. The closing delimiter may
  be followed by one or more spaces or tabs, which will be
  ignored.

  To include a literal `$` in the document, use `$$`.

  ## Comments

  Anything between the sequence `$--` and the end of the
  line will be treated as a comment and omitted from the output.

  ## Interpolated variables

  A slot for an interpolated variable is a variable name surrounded
  by matched delimiters.  Variable names must begin with a letter
  and can contain letters, numbers, `_`, `-`, and `.`.  The
  keywords `it`, `if`, `else`, `endif`, `for`, `sep`, and `endfor` may
  not be used as variable names. Examples:

  ```
  $foo$
  $foo.bar.baz$
  $foo_bar.baz-bim$
  $ foo $
  ${foo}
  ${foo.bar.baz}
  ${foo_bar.baz-bim}
  ${ foo }
  ```

  The values of variables are determined by the `Context` that is
  passed as a parameter to `renderTemplate`.  So, for example,
  `title` will return the value of the `title` field, and
  `employee.salary` will return the value of the `salary` field
  of the object that is the value of the `employee` field.

  - If the value of the variable is simple value, it will be
    rendered verbatim.  (Note that no escaping is done;
    the assumption is that the calling program will escape
    the strings appropriately for the output format.)
  - If the value is a list, the values will be concatenated.
  - If the value is a map, the string `true` will be rendered.
  - Every other value will be rendered as the empty string.

  When a `Context` is derived from an aeson (JSON) `Value`,
  the following conversions are done:

  - If the value is a number, it will be rendered as an
    integer if possible, otherwise as a floating-point number.
  - If the value is a JSON boolean, it will be rendered as `true`
    if true, and as the empty string if false.


  ## Conditionals

  A conditional begins with `if(variable)` (enclosed in
  matched delimiters) and ends with `endif` (enclosed in matched
  delimiters).  It may optionally contain an `else` (enclosed in
  matched delimiters).  The `if` section is used if
  `variable` has a non-empty value, otherwise the `else`
  section is used (if present).  (Note that even the
  string `false` counts as a true value.) Examples:

  ```
  $if(foo)$bar$endif$

  $if(foo)$
    $foo$
  $endif$

  $if(foo)$
  part one
  $else$
  part two
  $endif$

  ${if(foo)}bar${endif}

  ${if(foo)}
    ${foo}
  ${endif}

  ${if(foo)}
  ${ foo.bar }
  ${else}
  no foo!
  ${endif}
  ```

  The keyword `elseif` may be used to simplify complex nested
  conditionals.  Thus

  ```
  $if(foo)$
  XXX
  $elseif(bar)$
  YYY
  $else$
  ZZZ
  $endif$
  ```

  is equivalent to

  ```
  $if(foo)$
  XXX
  $else$
  $if(bar)$
  YYY
  $else$
  ZZZ
  $endif$
  $endif$
  ```

  ## For loops

  A for loop begins with `for(variable)` (enclosed in
  matched delimiters) and ends with `endfor` (enclosed in matched
  delimiters.

  - If `variable` is an array, the material inside the loop will
    be evaluated repeatedly, with `variable` being set to each
    value of the array in turn, and concatenated.
  - If `variable` is a map, the material inside will be set to
    the map.
  - If the value of the associated variable is not an array or
    a map, a single iteration will be performed on its value.

  Examples:

  ```
  $for(foo)$$foo$$sep$, $endfor$

  $for(foo)$
    - $foo.last$, $foo.first$
  $endfor$

  ${ for(foo.bar) }
    - ${ foo.bar.last }, ${ foo.bar.first }
  ${ endfor }

  $for(mymap)$
  $it.name$: $it.office$
  $endfor$
  ```

  You may optionally specify a separator between consecutive
  values using `sep` (enclosed in matched delimiters).  The
  material between `sep` and the `endfor` is the separator.

  ```
  ${ for(foo) }${ foo }${ sep }, ${ endfor }
  ```

  Instead of using `variable` inside the loop, the special
  anaphoric keyword `it` may be used.

  ```
  ${ for(foo.bar) }
    - ${ it.last }, ${ it.first }
  ${ endfor }
  ```

  ## Partials

  Partials (subtemplates stored in different files) may be
  included using the syntax

  ```
  ${ boilerplate() }
  ```

  The partials are obtained using `getPartial` from
  the `TemplateMonad` class.  This may be implemented
  differently in different monads.  The path passed
  to `getPartial` is computed on the basis of the
  original template path (a parameter to `compileTemplate`)
  and the partial's name.  The partial's name is substituted
  for the *base name* of the original template path
  (leaving the original template's extension), unless
  the partial has an explicit extension, in which case
  this is kept.  So, with the `TemplateMonad` instance
  for IO, partials will be sought in the directory
  containing the main template, and will be assumed
  to have the extension of the main template.

  Partials may optionally be applied to variables using
  a colon:

  ```
  ${ date:fancy() }

  ${ articles:bibentry() }
  ```

  If `articles` is an array, this will iterate over its
  values, applying the partial `bibentry()` to each one.  So the
  second example above is equivalent to

  ```
  ${ for(articles) }
  ${ it:bibentry() }
  ${ endfor }
  ```

  Note that the anaphoric keyword `it` must be used when
  iterating over partials.  In the above examples,
  the `bibentry` partial should contain `it.title`
  (and so on) instead of `articles.title`.

  Final newlines are omitted from included partials.

  Partials may include other partials.  If you exceed
  a nesting level of 50, though, in resolving partials,
  the literal `(loop)` will be returned, to avoid infinite loops.

  A separator between values of an array may be specified
  in square brackets, immediately after the variable name
  or partial:

  ```
  ${months[, ]}$

  ${articles:bibentry()[; ]$
  ```

  The separator in this case is literal and (unlike with `sep`
  in an explicit `for` loop) cannot contain interpolated
  variables or other template directives.

  ## Nesting

  To ensure that content is "nested," that is, subsequent lines
  indented, use the `^` directive:

  ```
  $item.number$  $^$$item.description$ ($item.price$)
  ```

  In this example, if `item.description` has multiple lines,
  they will all be indented to line up with the first line:

  ```
  00123  A fine bottle of 18-year old
         Oban whiskey. ($148)
  ```

  To nest multiple lines to the same level, align them
  with the `^` directive in the template. For example:

  ```
  $item.number$  $^$$item.description$ ($item.price$)
                 (Available til $item.sellby$.)
  ```

  will produce

  ```
  00123  A fine bottle of 18-year old
         Oban whiskey. ($148)
         (Available til March 30, 2020.)
  ```

  If a variable occurs by itself on a line, preceded by whitespace
  and not followed by further text or directives on the same line,
  and the variable's value contains multiple lines, it will be
  nested automatically.

  ## Breakable spaces

  When rendering to a `Doc`, a distinction can be made between
  breakable and unbreakable spaces.  Normally, spaces in the
  template itself (as opposed to values of the interpolated
  variables) are not breakable, but they can be made breakable
  in part of the template by using the `~` keyword (ended
  with another `~`).

  ```
  $~$This long line may break if the document is rendered
  with a short line length.$~$
  ```

  The `~` keyword has no effect when rendering to `Text`
  or `String`.

  ## Filters

  A filter transforms the value of a variable or partial.  Filters
  are specified using a slash (`/`) between the variable name (or
  partial) and the filter name.  Example:

  ```
  $for(name)$
  $name/uppercase$
  $endfor$

  $for(metadata/pairs)$
  - $it.key$: $it.value$
  $endfor$

  $employee:name()/uppercase$
  ```

  Filters may be chained:

  ```
  $for(employees/pairs)$
  $it.key/alpha/uppercase$. $it.name$
  $endfor$
  ```

  Some filters take parameters:

  ```
  |----------------------|------------|
  $for(employee)$
  $it.name.first/uppercase/left 20 "| "$$it.name.salary/right 10 " | " " |"$
  $endfor$
  |----------------------|------------|
  ```

  Currently the following filters are predefined:

  - `pairs`:  Converts a map or array to an array of maps,
    each with `key` and `value` fields.  If the original
    value was an array, the `key` will be the array index,
    starting with 1.

  - `uppercase`:  Converts text to uppercase.

  - `lowercase`:  Converts text to lowercase.

  - `length`:  Returns the length of the value:  number
    of characters for a textual value, number of elements
    for a map or array.

  - `reverse`:  Reverses a textual value or array,
    and has no effect on other values.

  - `chomp`:  Removes trailing newlines (and breakable space).

  - `nowrap`:  Disables line wrapping on breakable spaces.

  - `alpha`:  Converts textual values that can be
    read as an integer into lowercase alphabetic
    characters `a..z` (mod 26). This can be used to get lettered
    enumeration from array indices.  To get uppercase
    letters, chain with `uppercase`.

  - `roman`:  Converts textual values that can be
    read as an integer into lowercase roman numerials.
    This can be used to get lettered enumeration from array indices.
    To get uppercase roman, chain with `uppercase`.

  - `left n "leftborder" "rightborder"`:  Renders a textual value
    in a block of width `n`, aligned to the left, with an optional
    left and right border.  Has no effect on other values. This
    can be used to align material in tables.  Widths are positive
    integers indicating the number of characters.  Borders
    are strings inside double quotes; literal `"` and `\` characters
    must be backslash-escaped.

  - `right n "leftborder" "rightborder"`:  Renders a textual value
    in a block of width `n`, aligned to the right, and has no
    effect on other values.

  - `center n "leftborder" "rightborder"`:  Renders a textual
    value in a block of width `n`, aligned to the center, and has
    no effect on other values.
