changelog: "# Revision history for dobutokO-poetry\n\n## 0.1.0.0 -- 2020-06-01\n\n*
  First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n## 0.2.0.0 -- 2020-06-01\n\n*
  Second version. Fixed issue with the wrong convertion to the WAV sound file. Added
  mmsyn3 as an explicit dependency (it was implicit) and changed the \nnumber of the
  minimum mmsyn6ukr package version.\n\n## 0.3.0.0 -- 2020-06-02\n\n* Third version.
  Added new generalized functions to the DobutokO.Poetry module and extended with
  them the functionality in the Main module. \n\n## 0.3.1.0 -- 2020-06-02\n\n* Third
  version revised A. Fixed issue with being printed also the second command line argument
  for the Main.main function.\n\n## 0.3.2.0 -- 2020-06-02\n\n* Third version revised
  B. Fixed issues with being not accurate printing.\n\n## 0.4.0.0 -- 2020-06-03\n\n*
  Fourth version. Changed the module structure to simplify the usage in research purposes.
  Added new generalized variants of the functions with different\nnorms and different
  String -> [Int] conversion functions. Some documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.5.0.0
  -- 2020-06-04\n\n* Fifth version. Fixed issues with inappropriate message information
