  # Dovin

  A proof assistant for [Possibility
  Storm](http://www.possibilitystorm.com/)-style Magic: The Gathering puzzles.

  > He has an innate talent, heightened by magic, that allows him to clearly see
  > the flaws in any system or machine. After mere moments of scrutiny, Dovin can
  > provide a complete analysis, noting a particular machine's weaknesses,
  > highlighting its shortcomings, and predicting with startling accuracy exactly
  > how and when it will fail. --- [Dovin Baan, Planeswalker](https://magic.wizards.com/en/story/planeswalkers/dovin-baan)

  It provides a haskell DSL for expressing Magic actions, with tracking of life
  and other counters and validation of pre- and post- conditions. For example, if
  you try to tap a permanent that is already tapped, it will error. Or if you try
  to target a creature with hexproof. It can also track state-based effects, such
  as "all creatures get +1/+1" or "other creatures gain hexproof".

  It does not try to provide a full ruleset implementation, instead it's more
  akin to letting you lay out cards and counters in front of you and manipulate
  them as you would in a real game of paper magic.

  I've only added actions "as needed" to solve problems, so the built-in
  functions are rather incomplete right now. It is straightforward to add more
  though. See `src/Dovin/V2.hs` in conjuction with `src/Dovin/Actions.hs` for
  supported and tested actions, and `src/Dovin/Dump.hs` for untested experimental
  ones.

  ## Example

  ``` haskell
  module Solutions.Example where

  import Dovin

  main = run formatter solution

  solution :: GameMonad ()
  solution = do
    step "Initial state" $ do
      setLife Opponent 3

      withLocation Hand $ addInstant "Plummet"
      withLocation Play $ do
        addLands 2 "Forest"

      as Opponent $ do
        withLocation Play $ do
          withAttributes [flying, token] $ addCreature (4, 4) "Angel"
          withAttributes [flying]
            $ withEffect
                matchInPlay
                (matchOtherCreatures <> (const $ matchAttribute creature))
                (pure . setAttribute hexproof)
            $ addCreature (3, 4) "Shalai, Voice of Plenty"

    step "Plummet to destroy Shalai" $ do
      tapForMana "G" (numbered 1 "Forest")
      tapForMana "G" (numbered 2 "Forest")
      cast "1G" "Plummet"
      resolve "Plummet"
      with "Shalai, Voice of Plenty" $ \enemy -> do
        target enemy
        validate (matchAttribute flying) enemy
        destroy enemy

  formatter :: Step -> Formatter
  formatter step = case view stepNumber step of
    1 -> manaFormatter
      <> cardFormatter "opponent creatures" (matchLocation (Opponent, Play))
    _ -> boardFormatter

  manaFormatter = attributeFormatter $ do
    attribute "availble mana" $
      countCards (matchAttribute land <> missingAttribute tapped)
  ```

  `run` uses the supplied formatter to print out the board state at each step:

      1. Initial state
            (Active,Hand):
              Plummet (instant)
            (Active,Play):
              Forest 1 (land)
              Forest 2 (land)
            (Opponent,Play):
              Angel (creature,flying,hexproof,token) (4/4, 0)
              Shalai, Voice of Plenty (creature,flying) (3/4, 0)
      2. Plummet to destroy Shalai
            availble mana: 0
            opponent creatures:
              Angel (creature,flying,token) (4/4, 0)

  ## Solutions Index

  See `src/Solutions` for more extensive usage (spoiler alert: these are
  solutions for published Possibility Storm puzzles!)

  * `Dominaria5` uses a planeswalker.
  * `RivalsOfIxalan7` uses `withEffect` to model `exert`
    effects, and shows how to verify multiple blocking scenarios.
  * `Core19_9` has a fancy formatter to correctly track how much
    mana is available when working with `Powerstone Shard`, as well as spell
    tracking for `Aetherflux Reservoir`.
  * `GuildsOfRavnicaPre2` uses `forCards` to model undergrowth
    for a `Rhizome Lurcher`.
  * `GuildsOfRavnica1` uses `mentor`.
  * `GuildsOfRavnica3` uses a sacrifice wrapper to repeatedly
    create treasure tokens.
  * `GuildsOfRavnica8` shows using counters to correctly track
    `Muldrotha, the Gravetide` usage.
  * `GuildsOfRavnica9` handles `storm`.
  * `ExplorersOfIxalanContest` handles some pretty weird damage
    interactions.
  * `UltimateMasters` shows how to track opponent actions.
  * `ChannelFireball` automatically calculates High Tide mana.
  * `WarOfTheSpark2` shows off a hack for effects that depend on attributes of
    other cards (hopefully will have a better fix in API soon!)

  ## Development

      bin/dev  # Launch an interactive REPL
      bin/test # Runs all tests and lints
      bin/run  # Runs all solutions

  `src/Dovin/Dump.hs` is currently a dumping ground for prototype code. Actions
  are in the process of being moved to `Dovin.Actions`. To be moved they must:

    * Be unit tested.
    * Be documented.
    * The primary target card of an action should be the final parameter.
