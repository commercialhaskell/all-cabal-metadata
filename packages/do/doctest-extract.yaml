  # Known Issues

  *   For compatibility with original `doctest` parser
      you cannot write

      ~~~~
      {-# LANGUAGE MyPreferredExtension #-}
      ~~~~

      Instead you must write

      ~~~~
      :set -XMyPreferredExtension
      ~~~~

  * In Literal Haskell files
    only `\\begin{code} ... \\end{code}` blocks are scanned,
    but not bird style code blocks.

  * `prop>` supports multi-line code,
    but both original `doctest` and `haddock` do not support it.

  * IO tests are not supported as `doctest` examples, so far.
    We need a syntactic distinction for IO tests,
    because `doctest-extract` does not employ a type-checker.
    We could mark IO tests
    with a specific `id` function, as in `ioTest $ runMyTest`
    or a type annotation, as in `runMyTest :: IO ()`.


  # Tipps and Tricks

  ## How to disable selected tests?

  For focussing on certain tests it can be useful to disable other ones.
  We have not implemented a mechanism to disable parts of the test suite
  in `doctest-extract`,
  because this would require to implement a way to identify tests.
  You can still disable some of the tests
  without explicit support by `doctest-extraxt`.

  * If you want to disable whole modules,
    you may make a copy of the auto-generated `Test/Main.hs`
    and remove the modules that you want to skip.

  * For disabling all tests on a function
    you may turn a Haddock comment into a plain comment
    by removing the bar after the opening of the comment.

  * For disabling individual tests you may prefix `>>>` and `prop>`
    with an asterisk or the like.

  These tricks work best in conjunction with a revision control systen,
  such that it always reminds you that there are tests disabled temporarily.
