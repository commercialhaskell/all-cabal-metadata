  # Doctest: Test interactive Haskell examples

  `doctest` is a small program, that checks [examples in Haddock comments](http://www.haskell.org/haddock/doc/html/ch03s08.html#id566093).  It is similar
  to the [popular Python module with the same name](http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html).


  ## Installation

  `doctest` is available from
  [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/doctest).
  Install it, by typing:

      cabal install doctest

  Make sure that Cabal's `bindir` is on your `PATH`.

  On Linux:

      export PATH="$HOME/.cabal/bin:$PATH"

  On Mac OS X:

      export PATH="$HOME/Library/Haskell/bin:$PATH"

  On Windows:

      set PATH="%AppData%\cabal\bin\;%PATH%"

  For more information, see the [section on paths in the Cabal User Guide](http://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/installing-packages.html#paths-in-the-simple-build-system).

  ## Usage

  Below is a small Haskell module.
  The module contains a Haddock comment with some examples of interaction.
  The examples demonstrate how the module is supposed to be used.

  ```haskell
  module Fib where

  -- | Compute Fibonacci numbers
  --
  -- Examples:
  --
  -- >>> fib 10
  -- 55
  --
  -- >>> fib 5
  -- 5
  fib :: Int -> Int
  fib 0 = 0
  fib 1 = 1
  fib n = fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)
  ```

  (A comment line starting with `>>>` denotes an _expression_.
  All comment lines following an expression denote the _result_ of that expression.
  Result is defined by what a
  [REPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop) (e.g. ghci)
  prints to `stdout` and `stderr` when evaluating that expression.)

  With `doctest` you may check whether the implementation satisfies the given examples, by typing:

      doctest Fib.hs

  You may produce Haddock documentation for that module with:

      haddock -h Fib.hs -o doc/

  ### Example groups

  Examples from a single Haddock comment are grouped together and share the same
  scope.  E.g. the following works:

  ```haskell
  -- |
  -- >>> let x = 23
  -- >>> x + 42
  -- 65
  ```

  If an example fails, subsequent examples from the same group are skipped.  E.g.
  for

  ```haskell
  -- |
  -- >>> let x = 23
  -- >>> let n = x + y
  -- >>> print n
  ```

  `print n` is not tried, because `let n = x + y` fails (`y` is not in scope!).

  #### A note on performance

  By default, `doctest` calls `:reload` between each group to clear GHCi's scope
  of any local definitions. This ensures that previous examples cannot influence
  later ones. However, it can lead to performance penalties if you are using
  `doctest` in a project with many modules. One possible remedy is to pass the
  `--fast` flag to `doctest`, which disables calling `:reload` between groups.
  If `doctest`s are running too slowly, you might consider using `--fast`.
  (With the caveat that the order in which groups appear now matters!)

  However, note that due to a
  [bug on GHC 8.2.1 or later](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/14052),
  the performance of `--fast` suffers significantly when combined with the
  `--preserve-it` flag (which keeps the value of GHCi's `it` value between
  examples).

  ### Setup code

  You can put setup code in a [named chunk][named-chunks] with the name `$setup`.
  The setup code is run before each example group.  If the setup code produces
  any errors/failures, all tests from that module are skipped.

  Here is an example:

  ```haskell
  module Foo where

  import Bar.Baz

  -- $setup
  -- >>> let x = 23 :: Int

  -- |
  -- >>> foo + x
  -- 65
  foo :: Int
  foo = 42
  ```

  Note that you should not place setup code inbetween the module header (`module
  ...  where`) and import declarations. GHC will not be able to parse it ([issue
   #167](https://github.com/sol/doctest/issues/167)). It is best to place setup
  code right after import declarations, but due to its declarative nature you can
  place it anywhere inbetween top level declarations as well.


  ### Multi-line input
  GHCi supports commands which span multiple lines, and the same syntax works for doctest:

  ```haskell
  -- |
  -- >>> :{
  --  let
  --    x = 1
  --    y = 2
  --  in x + y + multiline
  -- :}
  -- 6
  multiline = 3
  ```

  Note that `>>>` can be left off for the lines following the first: this is so that
  haddock does not strip leading whitespace. The expected output has whitespace
  stripped relative to the :}.

  Some peculiarities on the ghci side mean that whitespace at the very start is lost.
  This breaks the example `broken`, since the x and y aren't aligned from ghci's
  perspective.  A workaround is to avoid leading space, or add a newline such
  that the indentation does not matter:

  ```haskell
  {- | >>> :{
  let x = 1
      y = 2
    in x + y + works
  :}
  6
  -}
  works = 3

  {- | >>> :{
   let x = 1
       y = 2
    in x + y + broken
  :}
  3
  -}
  broken = 3
  ```

  ### Multi-line output
  If there are no blank lines in the output, multiple lines are handled
  automatically.

  ```haskell
  -- | >>> putStr "Hello\nWorld!"
  -- Hello
  -- World!
  ```

  If however the output contains blank lines, they must be noted
  explicitly with `<BLANKLINE>`. For example,

  ```haskell
  import Data.List ( intercalate )

  -- | Double-space a paragraph.
  --
  --   Examples:
  --
  --   >>> let s1 = "\"Every one of whom?\""
  --   >>> let s2 = "\"Every one of whom do you think?\""
  --   >>> let s3 = "\"I haven't any idea.\""
  --   >>> let paragraph = unlines [s1,s2,s3]
  --   >>> putStrLn $ doubleSpace paragraph
  --   "Every one of whom?"
  --   <BLANKLINE>
  --   "Every one of whom do you think?"
  --   <BLANKLINE>
  --   "I haven't any idea."
  --
  doubleSpace :: String -> String
  doubleSpace = (intercalate "\n\n") . lines
  ```

  ### Matching arbitrary output
  Any lines containing only three dots (`...`) will match one or more lines with
  arbitrary content. For instance,

  ```haskell
  -- |
  -- >>> putStrLn "foo\nbar\nbaz"
  -- foo
  -- ...
  -- baz
  ```

  If a line contains three dots and additional content, the three dots will match
  anything *within that line*:

  ```haskell
  -- |
  -- >>> putStrLn "foo bar baz"
  -- foo ... baz
  ```

  ### QuickCheck properties

  Haddock (since version 2.13.0) has markup support for properties.  Doctest can
  verify properties with QuickCheck.  A simple property looks like this:

  ```haskell
  -- |
  -- prop> \xs -> sort xs == (sort . sort) (xs :: [Int])
  ```

  The lambda abstraction is optional and can be omitted:

  ```haskell
  -- |
  -- prop> sort xs == (sort . sort) (xs :: [Int])
  ```

  A complete example that uses setup code is below:

  ```haskell
  module Fib where

  -- $setup
  -- >>> import Control.Applicative
  -- >>> import Test.QuickCheck
  -- >>> newtype Small = Small Int deriving Show
  -- >>> instance Arbitrary Small where arbitrary = Small . (`mod` 10) <$> arbitrary

  -- | Compute Fibonacci numbers
  --
  -- The following property holds:
  --
  -- prop> \(Small n) -> fib n == fib (n + 2) - fib (n + 1)
  fib :: Int -> Int
  fib 0 = 0
  fib 1 = 1
  fib n = fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)
  ```

  If you see an error like the following, ensure that
  [QuickCheck](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck) is a dependency
  of the test-suite or executable running `doctest`.

  ```haskell
  <interactive>:39:3:
      Not in scope: ‘polyQuickCheck’
      In the splice: $(polyQuickCheck (mkName "doctest_prop"))

  <interactive>:39:3:
      GHC stage restriction:
        ‘polyQuickCheck’ is used in a top-level splice or annotation,
        and must be imported, not defined locally
      In the expression: polyQuickCheck (mkName "doctest_prop")
      In the splice: $(polyQuickCheck (mkName "doctest_prop"))
  ```

  ### Hiding examples from Haddock

  You can put examples into [named chunks][named-chunks], and not refer to them
  in the export list.  That way they will not be part of the generated Haddock
  documentation, but Doctest will still find them.

  ```haskell
  -- $
  -- >>> 1 + 1
  -- 2
  ```

  [named-chunks]: http://www.haskell.org/haddock/doc/html/ch03s05.html

  ### Using GHC extensions

  There's two sets of GHC extensions involved when running Doctest:

  1. The set of GHC extensions that are active when compiling the module code
  (excluding the doctest examples). The easiest way to specify these extensions
  is through [LANGUAGE pragmas][language-pragma] in your source files.
  (Doctest will not look at your cabal file.)
  2. The set of GHC extensions that are active when executing the Doctest
  examples. (These are not influenced by the LANGUAGE pragmas in the file.) The
  recommended way to enable extensions for Doctest examples is to switch them
  on like this:

  ```haskell
  -- |
  -- >>> :set -XTupleSections
  -- >>> fst' $ (1,) 2
  -- 1
  fst' :: (a, b) -> a
  fst' = fst
  ```

  Alternatively you can pass any GHC options to Doctest, e.g.:

      doctest -XCPP Foo.hs

  These options will affect both the loading of the module and the execution of
  the Doctest examples.

  If you want to omit the information which language extensions are enabled from
  the Doctest examples you can use the method described in [Hiding examples from
  Haddock](#hiding-examples-from-haddock), e.g.:

  ```haskell
  -- $
  -- >>> :set -XTupleSections
  ```

  [language-pragma]: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/pragmas.html#language-pragma

  ### Cabal integration

  Doctest provides both, an executable and a library.  The library exposes a
  function `doctest` of type:

  ```haskell
  doctest :: [String] -> IO ()
  ```

  Doctest's own `main` is simply:

  ```haskell
  main = getArgs >>= doctest
  ```

  Consequently, it is possible to create a custom executable for a project, by
  passing all command-line arguments that are required for that project to
  `doctest`.  A simple example looks like this:

  ```haskell
  -- file doctests.hs
  import Test.DocTest
  main = doctest ["-isrc", "src/Main.hs"]
  ```

  And a corresponding Cabal test suite section like this:

      test-suite doctests
        type:          exitcode-stdio-1.0
        ghc-options:   -threaded
        main-is:       doctests.hs
        build-depends: base, doctest >= 0.8
