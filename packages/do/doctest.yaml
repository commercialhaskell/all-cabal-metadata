changelog: |
  Changes in 0.20.0
    - Allow doctest to be invoked via `cabal repl --with-ghc=doctest`
    - Include `ghc --info` output in `--info`
    - Make `--info` output formatting consistent with GHC

  Changes in 0.19.0
    - Better support for `cabal v2-*`

  Changes in 0.18.2
    - GHC 9.2 compatibility. (#305, thanks to Ryan Scott and Matthew Pickering)

  Changes in 0.18.1
    - GHC 9.0 compatibility. (#275)

  Changes in 0.18
    - Don't use unqualified references to `stderr` or `stdout` which may collide with definitions in user code. (#201)
    - Remove support for cabal-install sandboxes. They have been obsoleted in practice by Nix-style builds in cabal-install (i.e., the `v2-*` commands) and stack.

  Changes in 0.17
    - #266:
      - doctest now annotates its internal marker string as a `String`, to prevent misbehaviour in `OverloadedStrings` environments. This has a theoretical chance of breakage; if you're affected, please open an issue.
      - `evalEcho` no longer preserves `it`.

  Changes in 0.16.3
    - Add a cursor to highlight the differing portion between the
      expected and actual output. (#249)
    - GHC 8.10 compatibility. (#247, #257)

  Changes in 0.16.2
    - Add doctest's necessary-for-operation options to GHC's command
      line at the end, so that they over-ride anything provided by the
      user. (#233)
    - Allow GHC 8.8.

  Changes in 0.16.1
    - Fix loading plugins in doctests. (#224)
    - Require QuickCheck 2.13.1 or newer.
    - Remove dependency on `with-location`

  Changes in 0.16.0.1
    - Bump bounds to allow GHC 8.6. (#210)

  Changes in 0.16.0
    - Output format has changed to (hopefully) be more machine consumable. (#200)

  Changes in 0.15.0
    - Add `--verbose` for printing each test as it is run

  Changes in 0.14.1
    - Add test assets to source tarball (see #189)

  Changes in 0.14.0
    - GHC 8.4 compatibility.

  Changes in 0.13.0
    - Add `--preserve-it` for allowing the `it` variable to be preserved between examples

  Changes in 0.12.0
    - Preserve the 'it' variable between examples

  Changes in 0.11.4
    - Add `--fast`, which disables running `:reload` between example groups

  Changes in 0.11.3
    - Add `--info`
    - Add `--no-magic`

  Changes in 0.11.2
    - Make `...` match zero lines

  Changes in 0.11.1
   - Fix an issue with Unicode output on Windows (see #149)

  Changes in 0.11.0
   - Support for GHC 8.0.1-rc2

  Changes in 0.10.1
   - Automatically expand directories into contained Haskell source files (thanks @snoyberg)
   - Add cabal_macros.h and autogen dir by default (thanks @snoyberg)

  Changes in 0.10.0
   - Support HASKELL_PACKAGE_SANDBOXES (thanks @snoyberg)

  Changes in 0.9.7
   - Ignore trailing whitespace when matching example output

  Changes in 0.9.6
   - Fail gracefully if GHCi is not supported (#46)

  Changes in 0.9.5
   - Fix a GHC panic with GHC 7.6.1 (#41)

   - There is no distinction between example/interaction anymore.  Each
     expression is counted as an example in the summary.

  Changes in 0.8.0
   - Doctest now directly accepts arbitrary GHC options, prefixing GHC options
     with --optghc is no longer necessary

  Changes in 0.7.0
   - Print source location for failing tests
   - Output less clutter on failing examples
   - Expose Doctest's functionality through a very simplistic API, which can be

  # Doctest: Test interactive Haskell examples

  `doctest` is a small program, that checks [examples in Haddock comments](http://www.haskell.org/haddock/doc/html/ch03s08.html#id566093).  It is similar
  to the [popular Python module with the same name](http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html).


  ## Installation

  `doctest` is available from
  [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/doctest).
  Install it, by typing:

      cabal install doctest

  Make sure that Cabal's `bindir` is on your `PATH`.

  On Linux:

      export PATH="$HOME/.cabal/bin:$PATH"

  On Mac OS X:

      export PATH="$HOME/Library/Haskell/bin:$PATH"

  On Windows:

      set PATH="%AppData%\cabal\bin\;%PATH%"

  For more information, see the [section on paths in the Cabal User Guide](http://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/installing-packages.html#paths-in-the-simple-build-system).

  ## Usage

  Below is a small Haskell module.
  The module contains a Haddock comment with some examples of interaction.
  The examples demonstrate how the module is supposed to be used.

  ```haskell
  module Fib where

  -- | Compute Fibonacci numbers
  --
  -- Examples:
  --
  -- >>> fib 10
  -- 55
  --
  -- >>> fib 5
  -- 5
  fib :: Int -> Int
  fib 0 = 0
  fib 1 = 1
  fib n = fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)
  ```

  (A comment line starting with `>>>` denotes an _expression_.
  All comment lines following an expression denote the _result_ of that expression.
  Result is defined by what a
  [REPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop) (e.g. ghci)
  prints to `stdout` and `stderr` when evaluating that expression.)

  With `doctest` you may check whether the implementation satisfies the given examples, by typing:

      doctest Fib.hs

  You may produce Haddock documentation for that module with:

      haddock -h Fib.hs -o doc/

  `doctest` will fail on comments that `haddock` also doesn't like.
  Sometimes (e.g., [#251](https://github.com/sol/doctest/issues/251)), this means that `doctest` will fail on input that GHC accepts.

  `doctest` likes UTF-8. If you are running it with, e.g., `LC_ALL=C`,
  you may need to invoke `doctest` with `LC_ALL=C.UTF-8`.

  ### Example groups

  Examples from a single Haddock comment are grouped together and share the same
  scope.  E.g. the following works:

  ```haskell
  -- |
  -- >>> let x = 23
  -- >>> x + 42
  -- 65
  ```

  If an example fails, subsequent examples from the same group are skipped.  E.g.
  for

  ```haskell
  -- |
  -- >>> let x = 23
  -- >>> let n = x + y
  -- >>> print n
  ```

  `print n` is not tried, because `let n = x + y` fails (`y` is not in scope!).

  #### A note on performance

  By default, `doctest` calls `:reload` between each group to clear GHCi's scope
  of any local definitions. This ensures that previous examples cannot influence
  later ones. However, it can lead to performance penalties if you are using
  `doctest` in a project with many modules. One possible remedy is to pass the
  `--fast` flag to `doctest`, which disables calling `:reload` between groups.
  If `doctest`s are running too slowly, you might consider using `--fast`.
  (With the caveat that the order in which groups appear now matters!)

  However, note that due to a
  [bug on GHC 8.2.1 or later](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/14052),
  the performance of `--fast` suffers significantly when combined with the
  `--preserve-it` flag (which keeps the value of GHCi's `it` value between
  examples).

  ### Setup code

  You can put setup code in a [named chunk][named-chunks] with the name `$setup`.
  The setup code is run before each example group.  If the setup code produces
  any errors/failures, all tests from that module are skipped.

  Here is an example:

  ```haskell
  module Foo where

  import Bar.Baz

  -- $setup
  -- >>> let x = 23 :: Int

  -- |
  -- >>> foo + x
  -- 65
  foo :: Int
  foo = 42
  ```

  Note that you should not place setup code inbetween the module header (`module
  ...  where`) and import declarations. GHC will not be able to parse it ([issue
   #167](https://github.com/sol/doctest/issues/167)). It is best to place setup
  code right after import declarations, but due to its declarative nature you can
  place it anywhere inbetween top level declarations as well.


  ### Multi-line input
  GHCi supports commands which span multiple lines, and the same syntax works for doctest:

  ```haskell
  -- |
  -- >>> :{
  --  let
  --    x = 1
  --    y = 2
  --  in x + y + multiline
  -- :}
  -- 6
  multiline = 3
  ```

  Note that `>>>` can be left off for the lines following the first: this is so that
  haddock does not strip leading whitespace. The expected output has whitespace
  stripped relative to the :}.

  Some peculiarities on the ghci side mean that whitespace at the very start is lost.
  This breaks the example `broken`, since the x and y aren't aligned from ghci's
  perspective.  A workaround is to avoid leading space, or add a newline such
  that the indentation does not matter:

  ```haskell
  {- | >>> :{
  let x = 1
      y = 2
    in x + y + works
  :}
  6
  -}
  works = 3

  {- | >>> :{
   let x = 1
       y = 2
    in x + y + broken
  :}
  3
  -}
  broken = 3
  ```

  ### Multi-line output
  If there are no blank lines in the output, multiple lines are handled
  automatically.

  ```haskell
  -- | >>> putStr "Hello\nWorld!"
  -- Hello
  -- World!
  ```

  If however the output contains blank lines, they must be noted
  explicitly with `<BLANKLINE>`. For example,

  ```haskell
  import Data.List ( intercalate )

  -- | Double-space a paragraph.
  --
  --   Examples:
  --
  --   >>> let s1 = "\"Every one of whom?\""
  --   >>> let s2 = "\"Every one of whom do you think?\""
  --   >>> let s3 = "\"I haven't any idea.\""
  --   >>> let paragraph = unlines [s1,s2,s3]
  --   >>> putStrLn $ doubleSpace paragraph
  --   "Every one of whom?"
  --   <BLANKLINE>
  --   "Every one of whom do you think?"
  --   <BLANKLINE>
  --   "I haven't any idea."
  --
  doubleSpace :: String -> String
  doubleSpace = (intercalate "\n\n") . lines
  ```

  ### Matching arbitrary output
  Any lines containing only three dots (`...`) will match one or more lines with
  arbitrary content. For instance,

  ```haskell
  -- |
  -- >>> putStrLn "foo\nbar\nbaz"
  -- foo
  -- ...
  -- baz
  ```

  If a line contains three dots and additional content, the three dots will match
  anything *within that line*:

  ```haskell
  -- |
  -- >>> putStrLn "foo bar baz"
  -- foo ... baz
  ```

  ### QuickCheck properties

  Haddock (since version 2.13.0) has markup support for properties.  Doctest can
  verify properties with QuickCheck.  A simple property looks like this:

  ```haskell
  -- |
  -- prop> \xs -> sort xs == (sort . sort) (xs :: [Int])
  ```

  The lambda abstraction is optional and can be omitted:

  ```haskell
  -- |
  -- prop> sort xs == (sort . sort) (xs :: [Int])
  ```

  A complete example that uses setup code is below:

  ```haskell
  module Fib where

  -- $setup
  -- >>> import Control.Applicative
  -- >>> import Test.QuickCheck
  -- >>> newtype Small = Small Int deriving Show
  -- >>> instance Arbitrary Small where arbitrary = Small . (`mod` 10) <$> arbitrary

  -- | Compute Fibonacci numbers
  --
  -- The following property holds:
  --
  -- prop> \(Small n) -> fib n == fib (n + 2) - fib (n + 1)
  fib :: Int -> Int
  fib 0 = 0
  fib 1 = 1
  fib n = fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)
  ```

  If you see an error like the following, ensure that
  [QuickCheck](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck) is a dependency
  of the test-suite or executable running `doctest`.

  ```haskell
  <interactive>:39:3:
      Not in scope: ‘polyQuickCheck’
      In the splice: $(polyQuickCheck (mkName "doctest_prop"))

  <interactive>:39:3:
      GHC stage restriction:
        ‘polyQuickCheck’ is used in a top-level splice or annotation,
        and must be imported, not defined locally
      In the expression: polyQuickCheck (mkName "doctest_prop")
      In the splice: $(polyQuickCheck (mkName "doctest_prop"))
  ```

  ### Hiding examples from Haddock

  You can put examples into [named chunks][named-chunks], and not refer to them
  in the export list.  That way they will not be part of the generated Haddock
  documentation, but Doctest will still find them.

  ```haskell
  -- $
  -- >>> 1 + 1
  -- 2
  ```

  [named-chunks]: http://www.haskell.org/haddock/doc/html/ch03s05.html

  ### Using GHC extensions

  There's two sets of GHC extensions involved when running Doctest:

  1. The set of GHC extensions that are active when compiling the module code
  (excluding the doctest examples). The easiest way to specify these extensions
  is through [LANGUAGE pragmas][language-pragma] in your source files.
  (Doctest will not look at your cabal file.)
  2. The set of GHC extensions that are active when executing the Doctest
  examples. (These are not influenced by the LANGUAGE pragmas in the file.) The
  recommended way to enable extensions for Doctest examples is to switch them
  on like this:

  ```haskell
  -- |
  -- >>> :set -XTupleSections
  -- >>> fst' $ (1,) 2
  -- 1
  fst' :: (a, b) -> a
  fst' = fst
  ```

  Alternatively you can pass any GHC options to Doctest, e.g.:

      doctest -XCPP Foo.hs

  These options will affect both the loading of the module and the execution of
  the Doctest examples.

  If you want to omit the information which language extensions are enabled from
  the Doctest examples you can use the method described in [Hiding examples from
  Haddock](#hiding-examples-from-haddock), e.g.:

  ```haskell
  -- $
  -- >>> :set -XTupleSections
  ```

  [language-pragma]: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/pragmas.html#language-pragma

  ### Limitations

  Due to [a GHC bug](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/20670), running
  `:set -XTemplateHaskell` within `ghci` may unload any modules that were
  specified on the command line.

  To address this `doctest >= 0.19.0` does two things:

  1. Doctest always enables `-XTemplateHaskell`.  So it is safe to use Template
     Haskell in examples without enabling the extension explicitly.
  1. Doctest filters out `-XTemplateHaskell` from single-line `:set`-statements.
     So it is still safe to include `:set -XTemplateHaskell` in examples for
     documentation purposes.  It may just not work as intended in `ghci` due to
     that GHC bug.

  Doctest does not filter out `-XTemplateHaskell` from multi-line
  `:set`-statements.  So if you e.g. use

  ```
  >>> :{
  :set -XTemplateHaskell
  :}
  ```
  then you are on your own.


  ### Cabal integration

  Doctest provides both, an executable and a library.  The library exposes a
  function `doctest` of type:

  ```haskell
  doctest :: [String] -> IO ()
  ```

  Doctest's own `main` is simply:

  ```haskell
  main = getArgs >>= doctest
  ```

  Consequently, it is possible to create a custom executable for a project, by
  passing all command-line arguments that are required for that project to
  `doctest`.  A simple example looks like this:

  ```haskell
  -- file doctests.hs
  import Test.DocTest
  main = doctest ["-isrc", "src/Main.hs"]
  ```

  And a corresponding Cabal test suite section like this:

      test-suite doctests
        type:          exitcode-stdio-1.0
        ghc-options:   -threaded
        main-is:       doctests.hs
        build-depends: base, doctest >= 0.8
