  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/qfpl/dollaridoos.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/qfpl/dollaridoos)

  The money library provides a typesafe wrapper around numeric types
  that allows only those operations which are sensible in the context of
  monetary sums.
  For instance, adding two monetary values together makes sense, but
  multiplying money by money doesn't make any sense.
  Functions are also provided to multiply money by constants, among
  other things.
