  # doclayout

  ## 0.4.0.1

    * Add clause for Empty to renderList (#22).
    * Remove upper bound for criterion

  ## 0.4

    * Expose `unfoldD` [API change].
    * Remove `realLengthNoShortcut`, `isEmojiModifier`, and
      `isEmojiJoiner` [API change] (Stephen Morgan).
    * Add new exported functions `realLengthNarrowContext`,
      `realLengthWideContext`, `realLengthNarrowContextNoShortcut`,
      `realLengthWideContextNoShortcut`, `isSkinToneModifier`, `isZWJ`
      [API change] (Stephen Morgan).
    * Compute `realLength` strictly.
    * Make `getOffset` stricter.
    * Drop support for ghc <= 8.4, add test for ghc 9.2.
    * Don't collapse the CarriageReturn + Newline combination (#20).
      We want to ensure that a literal starting with a Newline
      doesn't lose the newline if it occurs after a CarriageReturn.
      This affects code blocks in pandoc that begin with newlines.
    * Improve performance of NoShortcut code (Stephen Morgan).
    * Simplify emoji processing (Stephen Morgan).
    * Add benchmarking for code with no shortcuts (Stephen Morgan).
    * Add unicodeWidth.inc to cabal file.
    * Fix `offset`, `minOffset`, `updateColumn` so they don't re-render.
    * Get unicode block widths directly from the Unicode specification, rather
      than writing it out ourselves (Stephen Morgan).
    * Resolve the width of ambiguous characters based on their context
      (Stephen Morgan).
    * Spacing marks should have nonzero width, even though they are combining
      characters (Stephen Morgan).
    * Add shortcuts for extended Latin, Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek,
      Devangari, Bengali, Korean, Telugu, and Tamil (Stephen Morgan).
    * Fix location of extra-source-files in cabal.
    * update.hs: require text package
    * Handle emoji variation modifiers specially, so the keypad emoji can be
      ignored (Stephen Morgan).  This results in a 16% speedup of realLength
      on ascii text.
    * Add benchmarks for all scripts used by more than 50 million people, plus
      a couple more. (#9, Stephen Morgan).

  ## 0.3.1.1

    * Fix the end of the block of zero width characters which contains
      the zero-width joiners and directional markings (Stephen Morgan, #5).
      This fixes a regression introduced in 0.3.1, affecting code
      points 0x2010 to 0x2030.

  ## 0.3.1

    * Improved handling of emojis.  Emojis are double-wide, but
      previously this library did not treat them as such.  We now
      have comprehensive support of emojis, including variation
      modifiers and zero-width joiners, verified by a test suite.
      Performance has been confirmed to be no worse for text without emojis.
      (Stephen Morgan, #1).  API changes: export `realLengthNoShortcut`,
      `isEmojiModifier`, `isEmojiVariation`, `isEmojiJoiner`.

  ## 0.3.0.2

   * NOINLINE `literal` instead of `fromString` (#2, sjakobi).
     This produces a further reduction in allocations and
     pandoc compile time.

  ## 0.3.0.1

   * NOINLINE `fromString` (#1).
     @sjakobi reports that this change reduced total allocations
     for building pandoc-2.12 with GHC 8.10.4 by 8.5% and reduced
     peak allocations are reduced from 3854MB to 3389MB.

  ## 0.3

    * Add foldlChar to signature of HasChars [API change].
    * Use foldlChar in realLength. This avoids a stack overflow
      we were getting with long strings in the previous version
      (with foldrChar).  See jgm/pandoc#6031.
    * Replace isBlank with isBreakable and improved startsWithBlank.
      Previously isBlank was used in the layout algorithm where
      what we really wanted was isBreakable.
    * Avoid unnecessary calculation in updateColumns.
    * Replace a right fold with a strict left fold.
    * Add strictness annotations in realLength and updateColumn.

  ## 0.2.0.1

    * Made `realLength` smarter about combining characters.
      If a string starts with a combining character, that character
      takes up a width of 1; if the combining character occurs after
      another character, it takes 0.  See jgm/pandoc#5863.
    * Improve `isBlank`, re-use in rendering code `for BreakingSpace`.
    * Fixed incorrect `Text` width in renderig blocks.

  ## 0.2

    * Add instances for `Doc`: `Data`, `Typeable`, `Ord`, `Read`, `Generic`.
    * Add `literal` (like `text`, but polymorphic).
    * Change some `IsString` constraints to `HasChars`.
    * Add some default definitions for methods in `HasChars`.
    * Change `offset` and `minOffset` to be more efficient (in
      simple cases they no longer render and count line lengths).
    * Add `updateColumn`.
    * Fix problem with `lblock`/`cblock`/`rblock` when `chop` is
      invoked. This caused very strange behavior in which text
      got reversed in certain circumstances.

  ## 0.1

    * Initial release.

  # doclayout

  [![CI
  tests](https://github.com/jgm/doclayout/workflows/CI%20tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jgm/doclayout/actions)

  This is a prettyprinting library designed for laying out
  plain-text documents.  It originated in the pandoc module
  Text.Pandoc.Pretty, and its development has been guided by
  pandoc's needs in rendering wrapped textual documents.

  In supports wrapping of text on breaking spaces, indentation
  and other line prefixes, blank lines, and tabular content.

  Example:

  ``` haskell
  Text.DocLayout> mydoc = hang 2 "- " (text "foo" <+> text "bar")
  Text.DocLayout> putStrLn $ render (Just 20) mydoc
  - foo bar
  Text.DocLayout> putStrLn $ render (Just 10) (prefixed "> " (mydoc $+$ mydoc))
  > - foo
  >   bar
  >
  > - foo
  >   bar
  ```

  The `Doc` type may be parameterized to either `String` or
  (strict or lazy) `Text`, depending on the desired render target.
