  # doclayout

  ## 0.2.0.1

    * Made `realLength` smarter about combining characters.
      If a string starts with a combining character, that character
      takes up a width of 1; if the combining character occurs after
      another character, it takes 0.  See jgm/pandoc#5863.
    * Improve `isBlank`, re-use in rendering code `for BreakingSpace`.
    * Fixed incorrect `Text` width in renderig blocks.

  ## 0.2

    * Add instances for `Doc`: `Data`, `Typeable`, `Ord`, `Read`, `Generic`.
    * Add `literal` (like `text`, but polymorphic).
    * Change some `IsString` constraints to `HasChars`.
    * Add some default definitions for methods in `HasChars`.
    * Change `offset` and `minOffset` to be more efficient (in
      simple cases they no longer render and count line lengths).
    * Add `updateColumn`.
    * Fix problem with `lblock`/`cblock`/`rblock` when `chop` is
      invoked. This caused very strange behavior in which text
      got reversed in certain circumstances.

  ## 0.1

    * Initial release.

  # doclayout

  [![CI
  tests](https://github.com/jgm/doclayout/workflows/CI%20tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jgm/doclayout/actions)

  This is a prettyprinting library designed for laying out
  plain-text documents.  It originated in the pandoc module
  Text.Pandoc.Pretty, and its development has been guided by
  pandoc's needs in rendering wrapped textual documents.

  In supports wrapping of text on breaking spaces, indentation
  and other line prefixes, blank lines, and tabular content.

  Example:

  ``` haskell
  Text.DocLayout> mydoc = hang 2 "- " (text "foo" <+> text "bar")
  Text.DocLayout> putStrLn $ render (Just 20) mydoc
  - foo bar
  Text.DocLayout> putStrLn $ render (Just 10) (prefixed "> " (mydoc $+$ mydoc))
  > - foo
  >   bar
  >
  > - foo
  >   bar
  ```

  The `Doc` type may be parameterized to either `String` or
  (strict or lazy) `Text`, depending on the desired render target.
