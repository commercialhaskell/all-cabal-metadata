description: |-
  docidx is a small tool which creates an HTML index of your
  installed Haskell packages, with links to each package's Haddock
  docs locally and on Hackage.  While "cabal install" now creates
  and maintains an index by module, sometimes it's nice to have this
  other view (and the quick links to Hackage).
  docidx queries your global and user package databases (via
  ghc-pkg, via the Cabal package), to build an index of all
  installed packages - including version numbers where more than one
  version is present, package synopses, links to the local Haddock
  docs, and a link to the package on Hackage.
  Packages are grouped by first letter, and there's an A-Z index at
  the top of the page, which can be easily extended via a config
  file to include extra links you think are handy - e.g. to the
  per-module index, to local ghc documentation, to the Haskell
  report, etc. - whatever you want).
