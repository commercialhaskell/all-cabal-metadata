description: ! 'This package provides monadic smart constructors for Javascript syntax
  representation

  implemented in the "WebBits" package. Most of this package''s code was autogenerated
  from IDL files

  available from the Web Consortium. See e. g.

  <http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/idl-definitions.html>

  These constructors help generate WebBits representation of Javascript code that
  works with

  methods and attributes of DOM objects in typesafe manner using monadic notation
  of Haskell.


  See documentation for the "Data.DOM" module for more information and a brief usage
  example.


  In the package version number, the version major reflects the level of DOM specification

  for which bindings are provided.


  In the 2.0.1 version, the WebBits dependency version number is 0.15.

  No other changes were made.'
