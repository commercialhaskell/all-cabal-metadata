description: "# Dovetail\n\nDovetail is a general-purpose PureScript interpreter written
  in Haskell.\n\nIt has excellent support for interop with Haskell code via PureScript's
  foreign function interface, along with a high-level Haskell API for integrating
  such code.\n\nAs such, it is possible to write low-level or domain-specific code
  in Haskell, and then to write the \"glue code\" in PureScript. In this way, Dovetail
  is a tool for reusing the frontend of the PureScript compiler (its syntax and type
  checker) to build domain specific languages in Haskell.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo
  understand the library and how to use it, it is recommended that you read through
  the Haddock documentation, alongside the provided examples:\n\n- Hackage documentation\n
  \ - [`dovetail` on Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dovetail)\n  - [`dovetail-aeson`
  on Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dovetail-aeson)\n  - [Haddocks on
  GitHub Pages](http://functorial.com/dovetail)\n- Examples:\n  - [JSON query language](https://github.com/paf31/dovetail/blob/main/examples/query-json/Main.hs)\n
  \ - [Fake data generator](https://github.com/paf31/dovetail/blob/main/examples/fake-data/Main.hs)\n
  \ \nYou can build the code and examples in this repository using `stack build`,
  and run the test suite with `stack test`.\n"
