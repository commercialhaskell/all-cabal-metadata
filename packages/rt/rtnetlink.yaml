  # Revision history for rtnetlink

  ## 0.2.0.0  -- 2019-07-04

  * According to rtnetlink(7), `ifi_change` in `struct ifinfomsg` "is reserved
    for future use and should be always set to `0xFFFFFFFF`", so did that.
  * Added a new typeclass, `Dump`, that encodes request-reply pairs that can be
    used with `dump`.
  * Added `Integral` and `IsString` instances for appropriate `newtype`s.
  * Added general `LinkType` for creating links, instead of creating a new type
    for each kind of link.
  * Added several new types to `Address.hs`, including ones for interface scope,
    precedence, labels, lifetimes, and IPv6 features.
  * Added several new types to `Link.hs`, including ones for bridge slaves, link
    groups, and link stats.
  * Added support for creating and managing vlan interfaces.
  * Removed redundancies in `Create`, `Destroy`, `Change`, and `Dump`
    typeclasses, as well as header classes. This should drastically improve the
    DRYness of adding features.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented nested `struct nlattr`s from being parsed.
  * Made many minor interface improvements.

  ## 0.1.0.4  -- 2017-03-28

  * Removed some obscure rtnetlink groups that aren't in `linux/rtnetlink.h` on
    Trusty.
  * Added `stack.yaml`.

  ## 0.1.0.3  -- 2017-03-27

  * Provided support for `base-4.8.*` by fixing `IsString` ambiguity in
    `LinkEther`.

  ## 0.1.0.2  -- 2017-03-26

  * Provided support for `transformers-0.4.*`.

  ## 0.1.0.1  -- 2017-03-25

  * Provided support for `base-4.7.*`.

  ## 0.1.0.0  -- 2017-03-24

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

description: |-
  A high-level, extensible, pure-Haskell interface to the
  ROUTE_NETLINK subsystem of netlink for manipulating
  network devices on Linux.
  RTNetlink provides the RTNL monad to simplify sending
  and receiving messages, pre-built types for manipulating
  devices and addresses, and typeclasses for creating your
  own messages, based on linux\/netlink.h,
  linux\/rtnetlink.h, et al.
