changelog: |
  0.4 -> 0.9
  ===============

  * I integrated all of the changes made during writing up my dissertation --
    mostly superficial/renamings, though I did realize that the DCsOf wrapper was
    superfluous.

  * In particular, I renamed @exact_case@ to @precise_case@, which is
    polyvariadic in the ad-hoc cases. This makes for code that very much
    resembles a normal case expression.

  0.2 -> 0.4
  ===============

  * drastic simplifications when writing the ICFP submission

  * I'll eventually work those older features back in --- Though it is
    *extremely* unlikely, I apologize if you were using them.

  0.1 -> 0.2
  ===============

  * improved the treatment of automatically generating algebras
  * emphasizing DCOf over DCU
  * moved all of the documentation from README to http://code.google.com/p/yoko
  * still obsessively tweaking names throughout the library
  * improved the treatment of unique constructors
  * added SiblingOf and a corresponding superclass constraint to DT
