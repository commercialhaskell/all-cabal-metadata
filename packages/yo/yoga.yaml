description: |-
  The <https://facebook.github.com/yoga Yoga> library from
  <https://facebook.github.com/ Facebook> is a fast layout engine
  written in C that implements flexbox. There are two
  main ways to interface with these bindings. The high-level
  bindings are stored in the Yoga module and provide a more
  Haskell-like interface to the library. The other option is to
  directly use the C-level bindings in "Bindings.Yoga". If you do
  so you do so at your own risk (i.e. you must manage your own
  memory).
  The examples are not built nor included by default. Please
  refer to the source tarball for examples on how to use this
  library.
  These bindings are not affiliated with Facebook in any way,
  and have been developed separately for the sole purpose of
  interfacing with their open source library.
