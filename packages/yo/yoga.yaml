description: ! 'The <https://facebook.github.com/yoga Yoga> library from

  <https://facebook.github.com/ Facebook> is a fast layout engine

  written in C that implements flexbox. There are two

  main ways to interface with these bindings. The high-level

  bindings are stored in the Yoga module and provide a more

  Haskell-like interface to the library. The other option is to

  directly use the C-level bindings in "Bindings.Yoga". If you do

  so you do so at your own risk (i.e. you must manage your own

  memory).

  The examples are not built nor included by default. Please

  refer to the source tarball for examples on how to use this

  library.

  These bindings are not affiliated with Facebook in any way,

  and have been developed separately for the sole purpose of

  interfacing with their open source library.'
