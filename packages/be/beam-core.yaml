synopsis: Type-safe, feature-complete SQL query and manipulation interface for Haskell
changelog: ! '# 0.7.2.0


  Add compatibility with GHC 8.4 and stack nightly


  # 0.7.1.0


  Note ''0.7.1.0'' was released because the signature of `delete` was too specific

  in ''0.7.0.0'' due to an error when uploading the package.


  # 0.7.0.0


  ## Weaker functional dependencies on `MonadBeam`


  The functional dependency on `MonadBeam` is now just `m -> syntax be

  handle`. This allows us to define `MonadBeam` instances atop monad transformers

  (although we don''t have any yet!).


  ## Correct boolean handling


  Previous versions of beam used the SQL `=` operator to compare potentially

  `NULL` values. This is incorrect, as `NULL = NULL => UNKNOWN` in ANSI-compliant

  implementations. Beam has changed its emitted SQL to produce proper comparisons,

  but this can dramatically affect performance in some backends. Particularly,

  proper JOIN index usage in Postgres requires an exact match on an equality

  constructor, which may not be what you get when using the proper boolean

  handling.


  If you are okay using SQL null handling, you can use the new `==?.` and `/=?.`

  operators which produce an expression with type `SqlBool` instead. `SqlBool` is

  a type that can represent the SQL `BOOL` type in all its gritty glory. Note

  however, that these operators do not compare for haskell equality, only SQL

  equality, so please understand what that means before using them.


  Correspondingly, many functions that took `Bool` expressions now have

  corresponding versions that take `SqlBool`. For example, to use `guard_` with a

  `SqlBool` expression use `guard_''` (note the prime).


  (Note: I don''t really like that we have to do this, but this is the only way

  unless we introspect user expressions. Beam''s philosophy is to be as direct as

  possible. The `==.` operator corresponds to haskell `==`, and so produces the

  boolean we would expect as Haskell programmers. The `==?.` operator is a new

  operator that users must explicitly opt in to. Both produce the most direct code

  possible on each backend.)


  ## Aggregations return `Maybe` types


  In previous versions of beam, aggregations such as `avg_`, `sum_`, etc

  returned the an expression of the same type as its inputs. However,

  this does not match standard SQL behavior, where these aggregates can

  return NULL if no rows are selected for the aggregation. This breaks

  older code, but is more correct. To restore the older behavior, use

  the `fromMaybe_` function to supply a default value.


  ## Miscellaneous name changes


  The `Database.Beam.Query.lookup` function was renamed to `lookup_` to

  avoid overlap with the `Prelude` function of the same name.


  ## Reintroduce explicit backends to `Database` class


  Some database entites only work on particular backends. For example,

  beam-postgres extension support only works in beam-postgres. The lack

  of a backend parameter on the `Database` type class essentially

  mandated that every database entity worked on every backend. By

  introducing a backend parameter to `Database`, we allow the user to

  restrict which backends a database can work on.


  The old behavior is still easily recovered. Whereas before you''d write


  ```haskell

  instance Database MyDatabase

  ```


  Now write


  ```haskell

  instance Database be MyDatabase

  ```


  ## Require backends to explicitly declare types that can be compared for equality


  Beam previously allowed any two types to be compared for SQL

  equality. This is no longer the case. Rather, only types that are

  instances of `HasSqlEqualityCheck` for the given expression syntax can

  be checked for equality. Correspondingly, only types that are

  instances of `HasSqlQuantifiedEqualityCheck` can be checked for

  quantified equality.


  This change is somewhat invasive, as the relationship and join

  operators depend on the ability to check primary keys for

  equality. You may have to add appropriate class constraints to your

  queries. In order to assert that a table can be compared for equality,

  you can use the `HasTableEquality` constraint synonym.


  ### For Backends


  Backend implementors should establish instances of

  `HasSqlEqualityCheck` and `HasSqlQuantifiedEqualityCheck` for every

  type that can be compared in their syntax. You may choose to implement

  a custom equality and inequality operator. Alternatively, you can

  leave the instances empty to use the defaults, which match the old

  behavior.


  ## Properly deal with NULL values in equality


  Previous versions of Beam would use SQL `=` and `<>` operators to

  compare potentially `NULL` values. However, `NULL = NULL` is always

  false, according to the SQL standard, so this behavior is incorrect.


  Now, Beam will generate a `CASE .. WHEN ..` statement to explicitly

  handle mismatching `NULL`s. This is the ''expected'' behavior from the

  Haskell perspective, but does not match what one may expect in

  SQL. Note that it is always better to explicitly handle `NULL`s using

  `maybe_`, and beam recommends this approach in robust code.


  ## Remove `Auto` for fields with default values


  `Auto` was a convenience type for dealing with tables where some

  columns have been given a default value. `Auto` worked well enough but

  it was a very leaky abstraction. Moreover, it was

  unnecessary. Everything you can do with `Auto` can be done more safely

  with `default_`.


  For example, instead of using


  ```haskell

  insertValues [ Table1 (Auto Nothing) "Field Value" "Another Field Value" ]

  ```


  use


  ```haskell

  insertExpressions [ Table1 default_ (val_ "Field Value") (val_ "Another Field Value")
  ]

  ```

description: ! 'Beam is a Haskell library for type-safe querying and manipulation

  Beam is modular and supports various backends. In order to use beam, you will need
  to use

  @beam-core@ along with a specific backend (such as @beam-postgres@ or @beam-sqlite@)
  as

  well as the corresponding backend.
