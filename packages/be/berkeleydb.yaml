description: |-
  This library attempts to provide a memory efficient alternative to
  Data.Map. The BerkeleyDB system is bound and exposed through an
  interface that mimics Data.Map as much as possible.

  Features include: pure interface with fairly efficient sharing
  and a very small memory footprint.

  Tested with libdb4.6
