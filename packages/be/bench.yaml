description: ! "# Bench v1.0.10\n\nThis project provides the `bench` command-line
  tool, which is a more powerful\nalternative to the `time` command.  Use `bench`
  to benchmark a command using\nHaskell's `criterion` library.\n\nKey features:\n\n*
  Repeated runs\n* Detailed statistical output\n* Gorgeous HTML output (via the `--output`
  flag)\n  ([Example](http://www.serpentine.com/criterion/fibber.html))\n* Also supports
  CSV or templated output\n\n## Quick Start\n\nYou can install `bench` on macOS via
  [Homebrew](http://braumeister.org/formula/bench):\n\n```bash\n$ brew install bench\n```\n\n...
  or you can install `bench` using Haskell's `stack` tool.  To do that, first\ndownload
  the [Haskell toolchain](https://www.haskell.org/downloads#minimal),\nwhich provides
  the `stack` tool, then run:\n\n```bash\n$ stack setup\n$ stack install bench\n```\n\n`stack
  install` will install `bench` to `~/.local/bin` or something similar.\nMake sure
  that the installation directory is on your executable search path\nbefore running
  `bench`.  `stack` will remind you to do this if you forget.\n\nAnother alternative
  is to use [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/nix/). After its installation
  just execute:\n\n```$ nix-env -i bench```\n\nOnce you've installed `bench` (either
  by download or installation via `stack` or Nix),\nyou can begin benchmarking programs:\n\n```bash\n$
  bench 'sleep 1'  # Don't forget to quote the command line\nbenchmarking sleep 1\ntime
  \                1.003 s    (1.002 s .. 1.003 s)\n                     1.000 R²
  \  (1.000 R² .. 1.000 R²)\nmean                 1.003 s    (1.003 s .. 1.003 s)\nstd
  dev              92.92 μs   (0.0 s .. 101.8 μs)\nvariance introduced by outliers:
  19% (moderately inflated)\n\n$ bench true\nbenchmarking true\ntime                 410.3
  μs   (382.3 μs .. 443.3 μs)\n                     0.974 R²   (0.961 R² .. 0.987
  R²)\nmean                 420.7 μs   (406.8 μs .. 435.7 μs)\nstd dev              47.69
  μs   (40.09 μs .. 57.91 μs)\nvariance introduced by outliers: 81% (severely inflated)\n```\n\nAll
  output from the command being benchmarked is discarded.\n\nMultiple commands are
  also supported:\n\n```bash\n$ bench id ls \"sleep 0.1\"\nbenchmarking bench/id\ntime
  \                4.798 ms   (4.764 ms .. 4.833 ms)\n                     0.999 R²
  \  (0.998 R² .. 1.000 R²)\nmean                 4.909 ms   (4.879 ms .. 4.953 ms)\nstd
  dev              104.6 μs   (78.91 μs .. 135.7 μs)\n\nbenchmarking bench/ls\ntime
  \                2.941 ms   (2.889 ms .. 3.006 ms)\n                     0.996 R²
  \  (0.992 R² .. 0.998 R²)\nmean                 3.051 ms   (3.015 ms .. 3.094 ms)\nstd
  dev              129.7 μs   (104.3 μs .. 178.3 μs)\nvariance introduced by outliers:
  25% (moderately inflated)\n\nbenchmarking bench/sleep 0.1\ntime                 109.9
  ms   (108.5 ms .. 111.0 ms)\n                     1.000 R²   (1.000 R² .. 1.000
  R²)\nmean                 109.2 ms   (108.5 ms .. 109.7 ms)\nstd dev              903.0
  μs   (676.4 μs .. 1.212 ms)\n```\n\nYou can also output an HTML file graphing the
  distribution of\ntimings by using the `--output` flag:\n\n```bash\n$ bench 'ls /usr/bin
  | wc -l' --output example.html\nbenchmarking ls /usr/bin | wc -l\ntime                 6.716
  ms   (6.645 ms .. 6.807 ms)\n                     0.999 R²   (0.999 R² .. 0.999
  R²)\nmean                 7.005 ms   (6.897 ms .. 7.251 ms)\nstd dev              462.0
  μs   (199.3 μs .. 809.2 μs)\nvariance introduced by outliers: 37% (moderately inflated)\n```\n\n...

  Status](https://travis-ci.org/Gabriel439/bench.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Gabriel439/bench)\n\nThis
  is a pretty simple utility which just wraps `criterion` in a command-line\ntool,
  so I don't expect this project to change much.  However, only time will\ntell.\n\n##
