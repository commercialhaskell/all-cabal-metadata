  Haskell functions to open and manage a OpenGL window with libX11.


  This module is intended to be imported qualified, to avoid clashes with

  Prelude functions, e.g.


  > import qualified Graphics.UI.GLWindow as Window


  As an example, here is a simple module that uses some of these functions

  to open a OpenGL 3.2 Context:


  > module Main where

  >

  > import Graphics.Rendering.OpenGL

  > import qualified Graphics.UI.GLWindow as Window

  >

  > myLoop = do clear [ColorBuffer]

  >             t <- Window.time

  >             clearColor $= Color4 (sin (realToFrac t) * 0.5 + 0.5)

  >                                  (sin (realToFrac (t+1)) * 0.5 + 0.5)

  >                                  (sin (realToFrac (t+2)) * 0.5 +0.5)

  >                                  0

  >

  > main = do Window.init 3 2 -- initializes a OpenGL 3.2 context

  >           Window.loop myLoop -- stops when the ESC key is pressed

  >           Window.kill -- removes the window when the loop stops


  Special thanks to Tiago Farto (aka xernobyl) for coding the initial C version

  that was used as a base for these functions'
