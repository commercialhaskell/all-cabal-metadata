description: "This is a Haskell module for GLFW OpenGL framework\r\n(http://glfw.sourceforge.net).
  It provides an alternative\r\nto GLUT for OpenGL based Haskell programs.\r\n\r\nSOE
  (http://www.haskell.org/soe) now depends on this package.\r\n\r\nThe website for
  this Haskell module is at Haskell Wiki site:\r\nhttp://haskell.org/haskellwiki/GLFW\r\n\r\n=========\r\nChangeLog\r\n=========\r\n\r\n-
  Tue Jan 15 EST 2008\r\n\r\n  Version 0.3 adds Haddock documentation and the missing
  Joystick\r\n  APIs.\r\n \r\n- Thu Dec 20 EST 2007\r\n\r\n  Version 0.2 is repackaged
  to work with Cabal 1.2 or later.\r\n  Now it builds and installs out-of-box on most
  platforms.\r\n\r\n\r\n============\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nThe package
  comes together with a (partial) source distribution \r\nof GLFW v2.6, which is compiled
  and installed together with\r\nthe Haskell package.\r\n\r\nIt follows the standard
  Cabal package installation steps:\r\n\r\n1. To configure the module, type\r\n\r\n
  \      runhaskell Setup.hs configure\r\n   or\r\n\r\n       runhaskell Setup.hs
  configure --user --prefix=DIR\r\n\r\n   if you want to install the package to your
  user's directory\r\n   instead of the system one (replace DIR with your own directory\r\n
  \  choice).\r\n\r\n2. To build the module, type \r\n\r\n       runhaskell Setup.hs
  build\r\n\r\n3. To install, type \r\n\r\n       runhaskell Setup.hs install   \r\n\r\nIn
  the process it builds all GLFW C library source code. You may\r\nuse \"runhaskell
  Setup.hs build --verbose\" to see the actual \r\ncompilation steps.\r\n\r\n4. Optionally
  to build its Haddock documentation, type\r\n\r\n       runhaskell Setup.hs haddock\r\n\r\n====\r\nNOTE\r\n====\r\n\r\nFor
  Windows users, you'll have to include GHC's gcc-lib directory \r\nin your PATH environment,
  e.g., c:\\ghc\\ghc-6.6.1\\gcc-lib, before \r\nconfiguring the GLFW module, otherwise
  it'll complain about missing\r\nprogram for ld.\r\n\r\nGHC 6.8.x is already equipped
  with Cabal 1.2, so everything should\r\nwork as expected. But for GHC 6.6.x users,
  you'll have to first \r\ninstall the newest version of Cabal 1.2 before installing
  GLFW. \r\nCabal 1.2 also requires the module FilePath, which doesn't come\r\nwith
  GHC 6.6.x.\r\n\r\n\r\n=============\r\nPackage Usage\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThe
  package is tested with GHC 6.6.1 (with Cabal 1.2.2) on all\r\nthree platforms (Linux,
  Win32/MinGW, and Mac OS X). Though it may\r\nwork with older versions of GHC or
  even Hugs, they are not tested.\r\n\r\nIt installs a new Haskell package called
  \"GLFW\" and the actual\r\nmodule to import is \"Graphics.UI.GLFW\". You'll need
  to pass \r\n\"-package GLFW\" to GHC if you want to compile it.\r\n\r\nGLFW itself
  is well documented (see GLFW website), and the\r\nHaskell module API is documented
  via Haddock. \r\n\r\nNot all functions are fully tested, and there are still a \r\nfew
  GLFW C functions missing from the Haskell module, namely \r\nthe image loading functions.
  They are excluded because image\r\nhandling is a separate issue, and low level buffer
  manipulation\r\nwould obscure their use further. Texture loading from TGA\r\nformat
  is supported both from file and from memory (via a\r\nstring buffer). \r\n\r\nThe
  Haskell module also provides basic text rendering while\r\nGLFW doesn't. It comes
  from a free 8x16 font which is made\r\ninto a TGA texture, stored as a Haskell string
  in the file \r\nGLFW.hs (also the reason for its big size). Text rendering\r\nis
  only possible with Alpha enabled. Again, see SOE.hs from\r\nthe SOE package for
  sample usage.\r\n\r\nGLFW doesn't work well with GHC threads, forkIO or threadDelay.
  \r\nSo avoid them if you can.\r\n\r\n\r\n===================\r\nContact Information\r\n===================\r\n\r\nYou
  may send your bug report and feature request to the package \r\nmaintainer: Paul
  H. Liu <paul@thev.net>.\r\n\r\n--\r\nLast Updated: Tue Jan 15 EST 2008\r\n"
