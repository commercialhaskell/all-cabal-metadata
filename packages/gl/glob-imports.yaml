  # glob-imports

  ![build status](https://github.com/parsonsmatt/glob-imports/actions/workflows/haskell.yml/badge.svg)

  A Haskell source  preprocessor which generalizes `persistent-discover` and
  `hspec-discover`, allowing you to metaprogram with source files.

  A big limitation of `TemplateHaskell` is that it cannot modify the import list
  of a file. The only way to metaprogram with the imports is to use a source
  preprocessor like this.

  ## As an executable

  Let's say you've got a ton of `persistent` database models, all defined in a
  module hierarchy like this:

  ```
  src/
    Models/
      Foo.hs
      Bar.hs
      Baz.hs
      Blargh.hs
      What.hs
      OhNo.hs
  ```

  If you're using `persistent` to automatically generate migrations, you'll want
  to have all the `[EntityDef]` in scope from each module. You can do that by
  importing each module that defines models and calling `$(discoverEntities)`,
  introduced in `persistent-2.13`.

  But you may forget to import a module.

  This utility splices in a qualified import statement for *all* the modules defined in the
  current directory and sub-directories, along with a list of imported modules. From this, you can use
  [`discover-instances`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/discover-instances)
  or other `TemplateHaskell` code to work with these.

  To use it, place the following command in a file, located in the same directory
  that your Haskell modules are in:

  ```haskell
  -- src/Models/All.hs

  {-# OPTIONS_GHC -F -pgmF glob-imports #-}

  module Models.All where

  import Database.Persist.Sql
  -- GLOB_IMPORTS_SPLICE

  allEntities :: [EntityDef]
  allEntities = $(discoverEntities)
  ```

  The preprocessor will glob files in the current directory, and import all of
  them qualified. The result would look like this:

  ```haskell
  -- src/Models/All.hs

  -- post-processed

  module Models.All where

  import Database.Persist.Sql
  import qualified Models.Foo
  import qualified Models.Bar
  import qualified Models.Baz
  import qualified Models.Blargh
  import qualified Models.What
  import qualified Models.OhNo

  _importedModules :: [String]
  _importedModules =
      [ "Models.Foo"
      , "Models.Bar"
      , "Models.Baz"
      , "Models.Blargh"
      , "Models.What"
      , "Models.OhNo"
      ]

  allEntities :: [EntityDef]
  allEntities = $(discoverEntities)
  ```

  You'll need to add `glob-imports` to the `build-tool-depends` on your cabal file
  for this to work.
