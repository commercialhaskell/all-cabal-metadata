  # kparams (in Haskell)

  Extracts kernel parameter values from /proc/cmdline. Handles bare and quoted
  parameters. This is a rewrite of the
  [original kparams](https://github.com/mcsaucy/kparams) in Haskell.

  See
  [kernel.org's docs on kernel parameters](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html)
  for more information. While the docs mention using double-quotes to protect
  values with spaces, we also recognize single-quotes and certain escape
  sequences to support things like `quoted="\"value\""`.

  Check out `test/` to see examples of what we can extract.

  ## Usage

  `$ kparams PARAM_NAME [DEFAULT_VALUE]`

  ## What's the difference between the shell implementation of kparams and this?

  They should be functionally similar. Error messages will differ, although they
  should error under the same conditions. Most significantly, this version is
  hundreds of times faster.
