  # Shpadoinkle Core

  Shpadoinkle is a programming model for UI development, oriented around simplicity,
  performance, and ergonomics.

  ## The core concept

  Is to model the user interface as a pure function from some model `a` to Html.
  This is not a new idea in the slightest. Declaratively describing the view in terms
  of the model through a data structure is the dominant approach in UI today. And
  for good reason.

  If all we need is to render something based on some `a` we can have `Html` be a
  simple data structure where `Html :: Type`.

  ```haskell
  view :: a -> Html
  ```

  This might look something like.

  ```haskell
  view :: Text -> Html
  view username =
    H "div" [ ("class", "greeting") ] [ Text $ "Hi there!" <> username ]
  ```

  ## Events and effects

  Which is all well and good, and something we might expect from a static renderer,
  like Heist, or Blaze. Shpadoinkle handles this by allowing for `Html` to have two
  type variables associated with events, `Html :: (Type -> Type) -> Type -> Type`.

  The first is typically some Monad you wish to use in response to events `m`, and
  the second is the payload of those events, typically the model for your view `a`.

  These variables in `Html m a` are strickly about event listeners, so any view
  that doesn't have event listeners should be parametic in both `m` and `a`.

  Let's look at a toggle as an example.

  ```haskell
  toggle :: Applicative m => Bool -> Html m Bool
  toggle b = h "div" []
    [ text $ "Currently it's " <> if b then "ON" else "OFF"
    , h "button" [ listen "click" (not b) ] [ text "Toggle" ]
    ]
  ```

  That's it, we have a stateful view. When the user click's on
  the "Toggle" button the state will switch. Because we do a pure
  state transition in this function, `m` need only be `Applicative`.
  We could put `Identity` here if we wanted to, but keeping `m` general
  helps our views compose.

  But what if we need to do _more_? Well we can update our `m` to
  have more functionality. Let's add some logging to the console.

  ```haskell
  toggle :: Bool -> Html IO Bool
  toggle b = h "div" []
    [ text $ "Currently it's " <> if b then "ON" else "OFF"
    , h "button"
      [ listen' "click" $ do
          putStrLn "We toggled!"
          return $ not b
      ] [ text "Toggle" ]
    ]
  ```

  What if we want to access some record of capabilities? Or update some
  concurrent memory thing? Let's say we have an enterprise grade Monad,

  ```haskell
  newtype App a = App { runApp :: RIO (TVar Metrics) a }
    deriving (Functor, Applicative, Monad, MonadReader (TVar Metrics), MonadIO, MonadJSM)


  toggle :: Bool -> Html App Bool
  toggle b = h "div" []
    [ text $ "Currently it's " <> if b then "ON" else "OFF"
    , h "button"
      [ listen' "click" $ do
          metrics <- ask
          liftIO $ do
            atomically . modifyTVar metrics $
              \m -> m { toggleCount = toggleCount m + 1 }
            putStrLn "We toggled!"
          return $ not b
      ] [ text "Toggle" ]
    ]
  ```

  ## Composing views

  In Shpadoinkle we can compose views without impedance if the types match,
  or are parametric. For example.

  ```haskell
  hero :: Html m a
  hero = h "h1" [] [ text "Online String Reverse" ]

  input :: Html m Text
  input = h "input" [ onInput id ] []

  view :: Text -> Html m Text
  view s = h "div" []
    [ hero  -- no impedance, this Html is fully generic
    , input -- no impedance, this Html has matching types `(Text ~ Text)`
    , text $ "Reversed: \"" <> reverse s <> "\""
    ]
  ```

  If you have nesting, with different types,
  we can resolve the mismatch using 'fmap' like so:

  ```haskell
  input :: Html m Text
  input = h "input" [ onInput id ] []

  view :: (Int, Text) -> Html m (Int, Text)
  view (i,t) = h "div" []

    -- here we update the `Text` side of the model
    -- with the value produced by `input`, and we
    -- increment the `Int` as well.
    [ (\t_ -> (i + 1, t_)) <$> input
    , text $ "Reversed: \"" <> reverse t <> "\""
    , text $ "you have reversed " <> pack (show i) <> " strings"
    ]
  ```

  ## The primitive

  The Shpadoinkle programming model core primative is the `shpadoinkle` function.

  ```haskell
  shpadoinkle
    :: (Shpadoinkle b m a, Territory t, Eq a) =>
    => (m ~> JSM) -> (t a -> b m ~> m) -- How to render
    -> a -> t a                        -- What is our model
    -> (a -> Html (b m) a)             -- What to render
    -> b m RawNode -> JSM ()           -- Actually render
  ```

  This is the machine that runs a Shpadoinkle view. To run we need
  the following ingredients.

  ### `m ~> JSM`

  We need a _Natural Transformation_ from our `m` to `JSM`, so that
  we can perform the needed JavaScript effects in JSM from the `m`
  you provide.

  ### `t a -> b m ~> m`

  This a function that takes a state container of some kind `t`,
  and returns a _Natural Transformation_ from our Shpadoinkle backend `b`,
  to our monad `m`. Backends kind of works like Monad Transformers, where
  `b` wraps our Monad `m`, and needs to be unwrappable.

  ### `a`

  This is the initial value of our model. This will be passed to our view
  for the first render.

  ### `t a`

  This is the state container `t` that will drive the view. When the state
  changes, we should re-render the view. The semantic behind determing when
  to do this, is upto you via the `Territory` type class. Typically this is
  just a `TVar` as that is the provided cannonical implimentation.

  ### `a -> Html (b m) a`

  This is the view function, you actual application to render. It takes
  the model and returns the html to render, such that it's events produce the
  same model.

  ### `b m RawNode`

  This is the raw node we that will wrap our view. If you want the Shpadoinkle view
  to be the entire page, then you want to pass `document.body` as this node.
  You could use this to embed a Shpadoinkle application into another application,
  (such a Reflex-dom or Miso).
