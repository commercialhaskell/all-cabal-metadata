description: |-
  In his 1991 dissertation, Olin Shivers introduces a concept
  of control flow graphs for functional languages, provides an algorithm
  to statically derive a safe approximation of the control flow graph and
  proves this algorithm correct. In our student research project,
  Shivers' algorithms and proofs are formalized using the theorem prover
  system Isabelle.

  This package contains the Haskell prototype of the Isabelle
  formalization, together with some pretty printing and rendering
  facilities. It is provided as a reference, not as a ready-to-use library.
