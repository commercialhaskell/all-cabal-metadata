description: |-
  This package provides a Shellac backend based on the editline
  library.  editline provides a subset of the functionality
  provided by the GNU readline library.  However, it is licenced
  with a BSD-style license and is therefore suitable for some situations
  where GNU readline is not.  This backend features all the line
  editing capabilities provided by editline.
