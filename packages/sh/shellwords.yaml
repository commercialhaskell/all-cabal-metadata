  # ShellWords

  Parse a string into words, like a shell would.

  ## Motivation

  If you want to execute a specific command with input given to you from an
  untrusted source, you should not give that text as-is to a shell:

  ```hs
  let userInput = "push origin main"

  callCommand $ "git " <> userInput
  -- Forward output of the push command...
  ```

  You may be tempted to do this because you want to correctly handle quoting and
  other notoriously-difficult word-splitting problems. But doing so is a severe
  security vulnerability:

  ```hs
  let userInput = "push origin main; cat /etc/passwd"

  callCommand $ "git " <> userInput
  -- Forward output of the push command...
  -- And then dump /etc/passwd. Oops.
  ```

  Furthermore, any attempts to sanitize the string are unlikely to be 100%
  affective and should be avoided. The only safe way to do this is to not use a
  shell intermediary, and always `exec` a process directly:

  ```hs
  let userInput = "push origin main"

  callProcess "git" $ words userInput
  -- Forward output of the push command...
  ```

  Now, there's no vulnerability:

  ```hs
  let userInput = "push origin main; cat /etc/passwd"

  callProcess "git" $ words userInput
  -- Invalid usage. :)
  ```

  The new problem (but not a security-related one!) is how to correctly parse a
  string like `"push origin main"` into command arguments. The rules are complex
  enough that you probably want to get a library to do it.

  So here we are.

  ## Example

  ```hs
  Right args <- parse "some -complex --command=\"Line And\" 'More'"

  callProcess cmd args
  --
  -- Is equivalent to:
  --
  -- > callProcess cmd ["some", "-complex", "--command=Line And", "More"]
  --
  ```

  ## Unsafe Usage

  The following is a perfectly reasonable thing one might do with this library:

  ```hs
  Right (cmd:args) <- parse userInput

  callProcess cmd args
  ```

  However, if:

  1. `userInput` is un-trusted, and
  1. You do no further validation of what `cmd` can be,

  Then this re-introduces the original security vulnerability and, at that point,
  you might as well just pass `userInput` to a shell.

  - [`go-shellwords`][go-shellwords], which was itself inspired by
  - [`Parser::CommandLine`][parser-commandline]
