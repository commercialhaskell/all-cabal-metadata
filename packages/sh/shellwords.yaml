  # ShellWords

  Parse a string into words, like a shell would.

  ## Motivation

  If you need to execute commands given to you as user-input, you should know not
  to give that text as-is to a shell:

  ```haskell
  callProcess "sh" ["-c", "some --user --input"]
  ```

  Such code is a severe security vulnerability. Furthermore, any attempts to
  sanitize the string are unlikely to be 100% affective and should be avoided. The
  only safe way to do this is to not use a shell intermediary, and always `exec` a
  process directly:

  ```haskell
  callProcess "some" ["--user", "--input"]
  ```

  The new problem (and not a security-related one) is how to correctly parse a
  string like `"some --user --input"` into the command and its arguments. The
  rules are complex enough that you probably want to get a library to do it.

  So here we are.

  ## Example

  ```haskell
  Right (cmd:args) <- parse "some -complex --command=\"Line And\" 'More'"

  callProcess cmd args
  --
  -- Is equivalent to:
  --
  -- > callProcess "some" ["-complex", "--command=Line And", "More"]
  --
  ```

  ## Lineage

  This package is inspired by and named after

  - [`python-shellwords`][python-shellwords], which was itself inspired by
  - [`go-shellwords`][go-shellwords], which was itself inspired by
  - [`Parser::CommandLine`][parser-commandline]
