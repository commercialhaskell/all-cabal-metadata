description: ! '# ShellWords


  Parse a string into words, like a shell would.


  ## Motivation


  If you need to execute commands given to you as user-input, you should know not

  to give that text as-is to a shell:


  ```haskell

  callProcess "sh" ["-c", "some --user --input"]

  ```


  Such code is a severe security vulnerability. Furthermore, any attempts to

  sanitize the string are unlikely to be 100% affective and should be avoided. The

  only safe way to do this is to not use a shell intermediary, and always `exec` a

  process directly:


  ```haskell

  callProcess "some" ["--user", "--input"]

  ```


  The new problem (and not a security-related one) is how to correctly parse a

  string like `"some --user --input"` into the command and its arguments. The

  rules are complex enough that you probably want to get a library to do it.


  So here we are.


  ## Example


  ```haskell

  Right (cmd:args) <- parse "some -complex --command=\"Line And\" ''More''"


  callProcess cmd args

  --

  -- Is equivalent to:

  --

  -- > callProcess "some" ["-complex", "--command=Line And", "More"]

  --

  ```
