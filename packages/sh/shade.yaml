  A shade can be used to save heterogeneous types in containers with the same

  type e.g. using a type-class as a common denominator:


  > showshade :: Applicative m => Show a => a -> Shade m String

  > showshade a = pure (show a)

  >

  > hetero :: Shade Identity String

  > hetero = mconcat [ showshade () , showshade 2 , showshade "hej" ]


  The values inside a shade are stored in a context. We can swap this context

  by defining a transfer function:


  > idToIO :: Identity b -> IO b

  > idToIO (Identity v) = putStrLn "Transferring" *> pure v


  The context is switched using `transfer` and we can access the value in this

  new context by using `shadow`:


  > runInIO :: Shade Identity a -> IO a

  > runInIO = shadow . transfer idToIO


  The point to note about this example is that the values are stored in an

  shades with the identity as context. We can manipulate this context

  including the value. We cannot, however inspect the value since it is

  universally quantified.


  > noisy :: String -> Shade Identity (IO ())

  > noisy s = pure (putStrLn s)


  > main :: IO ()

  > main = do

  >   r <- runInIO hetero

  >   putStrLn r

  >   join . runInIO . mconcat . map (noisy . show) $ [0..10]
