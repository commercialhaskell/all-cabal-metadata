  This module provides static site generation tools for Html.

  ## Usage

  Lets say you have the following API routes for you SPA application:

  ```haskell
  type Pages m
    = "about" :> View m Int
    :<|> View m ()
  ```

  And you have a view for each. You can now produce a `SiteSpec` mapping these routes to the views.

  ```haskell
  site :: SiteSpec () (Pages m)
  site = about 0 :<|> const home
  ```

  Which can be written to static pages with `writeSite`. Each route will become a directory,
  and each View will become an `index.html` file in that directory.
