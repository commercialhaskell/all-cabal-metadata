  1.3.3 (2014/5/25)

  * allow process 1.2, regex-tdfa-1.2
  * add a hackage-compatible changelog

  1.3.2 (2013/11/13)

  * increase upper bound on Diff package

  1.3.1 (2012/12/28)

  * fix cabal file typo breaking the build

  1.3 (2012/12/28)

  * support latest Diff, cmdargs, test-framework; tested with GHC 7.6.1 (Magnus Therning)

  * fix unicode handling on GHC >= 7.2

  1.2.1 (2012/3/12)

  * use the more up-to-date filemanip package for easier Debian packaging

  1.2 (2012/2/26)

  * support latest cmdargs, test-framework, and GHC 7.4
  * more readable non-quoted failure output by default; for quoted output, use -p/--precise
  * the --all, --diff and --precise options now interact well

  1.1 (2011/8/25)

  * bump process dependency to allow building with GHC 7.2.1
  * new -a/--all flag shows all failure output without truncating

  1.0 (2011/7/23)

  * New home page/docs
  * The >>>= field is now required; you may need to add it to your existing tests
  * Input and expected output can now contain lines beginning with #
  * Multiple tests in a file may now have whitespace between them
  * The -i/--implicit option has been dropped
  * New -d/--diff option shows test failures as a unified diff when possible, including line numbers to help locate the problem
  * New -x/--exclude option skips certain test files (eg platform-specific ones)
  * Passing arguments through to test-framework is now more robust
  * Fixed: parsing could fail when input contained left angle brackets
  * Fixed: some test files generated an extra blank test at the end

  0.9 (2010/9/3)

  * show plain non-ansi output by default, add --color option
  * better handling of non-ascii test data. We assume that non-ascii file
    paths, command-line arguments etc. are UTF-8 encoded on unix systems
    (cf http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/fixing-unix-linux-filenames.html),
    and that GHC 6.12 or greater is used. Then:
    - non-ascii test file paths should render correctly, eg in failure messages
    - non-ascii test commands should run correctly
    - non-ascii expected output should match correctly
    - non-ascii regular expressions should match correctly. (Caveat: not
      thoroughly tested, this may break certain regexps, )
  * use regex-tdfa instead of pcre-light for better windows compatibility
    To avoid a memory leak in current regex-tdfa, only regular expressions
    up to 300 characters in size are supported. Also, DOTALL is no longer
    enabled and probably fewer regexp constructs are supported.  There are
    still issues on windows/wine but in theory this will help.
  * tighten up dependencies

  0.8 (2010/4/9)

  * rename executable to shelltest. The package might also be renamed at some point.
  * better built-in help
  * shell tests now include a full command line, making them more readable
    and self-contained. The --with option can be used to replace the first
    word with something else, unless the test command line begins with a
    space.
  * we also accept directory arguments, searching for test files below
    them, with two new options:
      --execdir        execute tested command in same directory as test file
      --extension=EXT  file extension of test files (default=.test)

  0.7 (2010/3/5)

  * more robust parsing
    - --debug-parse parses test files and stops
    - regexps now support escaped forward slash (\/)
    - bad regexps now fail at startup
    - command-line arguments are required in a test, and may be blank
    - a >>>= is no longer required to separate multiple tests in a file
    - comments can be appended to delimiter lines
    - comments can appear at end of file
    - files need not have a final newline
    - files containing nothing, all comments, or valid tests are allowed; anything else is rejected
    - somewhat better errors
    - allow indented input
  * support negative (-) and negatively-matched (!) numeric exit codes
  * let . in regexps match newline
  * warn but continue when a test file fails to parse
  * output cleanups, trim large output
  * more flexible --implicit flag
  * switch to the more robust and faster pcre-light regexp lib

  0.6 (2009/7/15)

  * allow multiple tests per file, handle bad executable better

  0.5 (2009/7/14)

  * show failure output in proper order

  0.4 (2009/7/14)

  * run commands in a more robust way to avoid hangs
    This fixes hanging when a command generates large output, and hopefully
    all other deadlocks. The output is consumed strictly. Thanks to Ganesh
    Sittampalam for his help with this.
  * --implicit-tests flag providing implicit tests for omitted fields
  * --debug flag
  * regular expression matching
  * disallow interspersed foreign options which confused parseargs
  * change comment character to #

  0.3 (2009/7/11)

  * misc. bugfixes/improvements

  0.2 (2009/7/10)

  * bugfix, build with -threaded

  0.1 (2009/7/10)

  * shelltestrunner, a generic shell command stdout/stderr/exit status tester

  of CLI programs/commands</h1>\n<img src=\"site/title2.png\">\n\n  [Install](#install)\n|
  [Usage](#usage)\n| [Options](#options)\n| [Test formats](#test-formats)\n| [Support/Contribute](#supportcontribute)\n|
  [Credits](#credits)\n</div>\n\n**shelltestrunner** (executable: `shelltest`) is
  a portable\ncommand-line tool for testing command-line programs, or general shell\ncommands,
  released under GPLv3+.  It reads simple test specifications\ndefining a command
  to run, some input, and the expected output,\nstderr, and exit status.  It can run
  tests in parallel, selectively,\nwith a timeout, in color, etc. \nProjects using
  it include\n[hledger](http://hledger.org),\n[Agda](http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda),\nand\n[berp](https://github.com/bjpop/berp).\n\n##
  Install\n\nThere may be a new-enough \n[packaged version](https://repology.org/metapackage/shelltestrunner/badges)\non
  your platform. Eg:\n\n|||\n|----------------|---------------------------------------\n|
  Debian/Ubuntu: | **`apt install shelltestrunner`**\n| Gentoo:        | **`emerge
  shelltestrunner`**\n\nOr, build the latest release on any major platform:\n\n|||\n|----------------|---------------------------------------\n|
  stack:         | **[get stack](https://haskell-lang.org/get-started)**, **`stack
  install shelltestrunner-1.9`**\n| cabal:         | **`cabal update; cabal install
  shelltestrunner-1.9`**\n\n## Usage\n\nHere's a minimal test file containing one
  shell test: <!-- keep synced with tests/examples -->\n\n    # A comment. Testing
  bash's builtin \"echo\" command (if /bin/sh is bash)\n    echo\n    >>>= 0\n\nThey're
  called \"shell test\" because any shell (`/bin/sh` on POSIX, `CMD` on Windows)\ncommand
  line can be tested.\nEach test begins with the command to test, followed by optional
  stdin input, \nexpected stdout and/or stderr output, and ends with the expected
  exit status.\nHere's another file containing two tests:\n\n    # Test that the \"cat\"
  program copies its input to stdout, \n    # nothing appears on stderr, and exit
  status is 0.\n    cat\n    <<<\n    foo\n    >>>\n    foo\n    >>>2\n    >>>= 0\n
  \   \n    # Test that cat prints an error containing \"unrecognized option\" or\n
  \   # \"illegal option\" and exits with non-zero status if given a bad flag.\n    cat
  --no-such-flag\n    >>>2 /(unrecognized|illegal) option/\n    >>>= !0\n\nTo run
  these tests:\n\n    $ shelltest echo.test cat.test\n    :echo.test: [OK]\n    :cat.test:1:
  [OK]\n    :cat.test:2: [OK]\n\n             Test Cases  Total      \n     Passed
  \ 3           3          \n     Failed  0           0          \n     Total   3
  \          3          \n\nThat's the basics! \nThere are also some alternate test
  formats you'll read about below.\n\n## Options\n\n    $ shelltest --help\n    shelltest
  1.9\n    \n    shelltest [OPTIONS] [TESTFILES|TESTDIRS]\n    \n    Common flags:\n
  \     -l --list             List all parsed tests and stop\n      -a --all              Don't
  truncate output, even if large\n      -c --color            Show colored output
  if your terminal supports it\n      -d --diff             Show expected output mismatches
  in diff format\n      -p --precise          Show expected/actual output precisely
  (eg whitespace)\n      -h --hide-successes   Show only test failures\n         --xmlout=FILE
  \     Specify file to store test results in xml format.\n      -D --defmacro=D=DEF
  \  Specify a macro that is evaluated by preprocessor\n                            before
  the test files are parsed. D stands for macro\n                            definition
  that is replaced with the value of DEF.\n      -i --include=PAT      Include tests
  whose name contains this glob pattern\n      -x --exclude=STR      Exclude test
  files whose path contains STR\n         --execdir          Run tests from within
  the test file's directory\n         --extension=EXT    File suffix of test files
  (default: .test)\n      -w --with=EXECUTABLE  Replace the first word of (unindented)
  test commands\n      -o --timeout=SECS     Number of seconds a test may run (default:
  no limit)\n      -j --threads=N        Number of threads for running tests (default:
  1)\n         --debug            Show debug info, for troubleshooting\n         --debug-parse
  \     Show test file parsing info and stop\n      -? --help             Display
  help message\n      -V --version          Print version information\n         --numeric-version
  \ Print just the version number\n    \n`shelltest` accepts one or more test file
  or directory arguments.\nA directory means all files below it named `*.test` (customisable
  with `--extension`).\n\nTest commands are run with `/bin/sh` on POSIX systems and
  with `CMD` on Windows.\nBy default, they are run in the directory in which you ran
  `shelltest`;\nwith `--execdir` they will run in each test file's directory instead.\n\n`--include`
  selects only tests whose name (file name plus intra-file sequence number) matches
  a\n[.gitignore-style pattern](https://batterseapower.github.io/test-framework#the-console-test-runner),\nwhile
  `--exclude` skips tests based on their file path.\nThese can be used eg to focus
  on a particular test, or to skip tests intended for a different platform.\n\n`-D/--defmacro`
  defines a macro that is replaced by preprocessor before any tests are parsed and
  run.\n\n`-w/--with` replaces the first word of all test commands with something\nelse,
  which can be useful for testing alternate versions of a\nprogram. Commands which
  have been prefixed by an extra space will\nnot be affected by this option.\n\n`--hide-successes`
  gives quieter output, reporting only failed tests.\n\nLong flags can be abbreviated
  to a unique prefix.\n \n\nFor example, the command:\n\n    $ shelltest tests -i
  args -c -j8 -o1 -DCONF_FILE=test/myconf.cfq --hide\n\n- runs the tests defined in
  any `*.test` file in or below the `tests/` directory\n- whose names contain \"`args`\"\n-
  in colour if possible\n- with up to 8 tests running in parallel\n- allowing no more
  than 1 second for each test\n- replacing the text \"`CONF_FILE`\" in all tests with
  \"`test/myconf.cfq`\"\n- reporting only the failures.\n\n## Test formats\n\nshelltestrunner
  1.9 adds some experimental new test file formats, described below.\nThese need more
  real-world testing and may evolve further, but they will remain supported or will
  have a migration path.\n\n| Format name | Description                                                                  |
  Delimiters, in order       |\n|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n|
  format 1    | command first, exit status is required                                       |
  `(none) <<< >>> >>>2 >>>=` |\n| format 2    | input first, can be reused by multiple
  tests, some delimiters can be omitted | `<<<    $$$ >>> >>>2 >>>=` |\n| format 3
  \   | like format 2, but with shorter delimiters                                   |
  `<      $   >   >2   >=`   |\n\nshelltestrunner tries to parse each file first with
  format 2, then format 3, then format 1.\nAll tests within a file should use the
  same format.\nI suggest choosing format 3 (short delimiters), switching to format
  2 when longer delimiters are needed.\n\n### Format 1\n\nTest files contain one or
  more individual tests, each consisting of a\none-line shell command, optional input,
  expected standard output\nand/or error output, and a (required) exit status.\n\n
  \   # COMMENTS OR BLANK LINES\n    COMMAND LINE\n    <<<\n    INPUT\n    >>>\n    EXPECTED
  OUTPUT (OR >>> /REGEXP/)\n    >>>2\n    EXPECTED STDERR (OR >>>2 /REGEXP/)\n    >>>=
  EXPECTED EXIT STATUS (OR >>>= /REGEXP/)\n\nWhen not specified, stdout/stderr are
  ignored.\nA space before the command protects it from -w/--with.\n\nExamples: \n[above](#usage),\n[shelltestrunner](https://github.com/simonmichael/shelltestrunner/tree/master/tests/format1),\n[hledger](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/tree/master/tests),\n[berp](https://github.com/bjpop/berp/tree/master/test/regression),\n[cblrepo](https://github.com/magthe/cblrepo/tree/master/tests).\n\n###
  Format 2\n\n(shelltestrunner 1.9+) \nThis improves on format 1 in two ways: it allows
  tests to reuse the\nsame input, and it allows delimiters to often be omitted.\n\nTest
  files contain one or more test groups. \nA test group consists of some optional
  standard input and one or more tests.\nEach test is a one-line shell command followed
  by optional expected standard output, \nerror output and/or numeric exit status,
  separated by delimiters.\n\n    # COMMENTS OR BLANK LINES\n    <<<\n    INPUT\n
  \   $$$ COMMAND LINE\n    >>>\n    EXPECTED OUTPUT (OR >>> /REGEX/)\n    >>>2\n
  \   EXPECTED STDERR (OR >>>2 /REGEX/)\n    >>>= EXPECTED EXIT STATUS (OR >>>= /REGEX/
  OR >>>=)\n    # COMMENTS OR BLANK LINES\n    ADDITIONAL TESTS FOR THIS INPUT\n    ADDITIONAL
  TEST GROUPS WITH DIFFERENT INPUT\n\nAll test parts are optional except the command
  line.\nIf not specified, stdout and stderr are expected to be empty\nand exit status
  is expected to be zero.\n\nTwo spaces between `$$$` and the command protects it
  from -w/--with.\n\nThe `<<<` delimiter is optional for the first input in a file.\nWithout
  it, input begins at the first non-blank/comment line.\nInput ends at the `$$$` delimiter.
  You can't put a comment before the first `$$$`.\n\nThe `>>>` delimiter is optional
  except when matching via regex.\nExpected output/stderr extends to the next `>>>2`
  or `>>>=` if present,\nor to the last non-blank/comment line before the next `<<<`
  or `$$$` or file end.\n`/REGEX/` regular expression patterns may be used instead
  of\nspecifying the expected output in full. The regex syntax is\n[regex-tdfa](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/regex-tdfa)'s,
  plus\nyou can put `!` before `/REGEX/` to negate the match.\n\nThe [exit status](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status)
  is a\nnumber, normally 0 for a successful exit.  This too can be prefixed\nwith
  `!` to negate the match, or you can use a `/REGEX/` pattern.\nA `>>>=` with nothing
  after it ignores the exit status.\n\nExamples: <!-- keep synced with tests/examples
  -->\n\nAll delimiters explicit:\n\n    # cat copies its input to stdout\n    <<<\n
  \   foo\n    $$$ cat\n    >>>\n    foo\n\n    # or, given a bad flag, prints a platform-specific
  error and exits with non-zero status\n    $$$ cat --no-such-flag\n    >>>2 /(unrecognized|illegal)
  option/\n    >>>= !0\n\n    # echo ignores the input and prints a newline.\n    #
  We need the >>>= (or a >>>2) to delimit the whitespace which\n    # would otherwise
  be ignored.\n    $$$ echo\n    >>>\n\n    >>>=\n\nNon-required `<<<` and `>>>` delimiters
  omitted:\n\n    foo\n    $$$ cat\n    foo\n\n    $$$ cat --no-such-flag\n    >>>2
  /(unrecognized|illegal) option/\n    >>>= !0\n\n    $$$ echo\n\n    >>>=\n\n###
  Format 3\n\n(shelltestrunner 1.9+)\nThe same as format 2, but with more convenient
  short delimiters: < $ > >2 >=.\n\n    # COMMENTS OR BLANK LINES\n    <\n    INPUT\n
  \   $ COMMAND LINE\n    >\n    EXPECTED OUTPUT (OR > /REGEX/)\n    >2\n    EXPECTED
  STDERR (OR >2 /REGEX/)\n    >= EXPECTED EXIT STATUS (OR >= /REGEX/ OR >=)\n    #
  COMMENTS OR BLANK LINES\n    ADDITIONAL TESTS FOR THIS INPUT\n    ADDITIONAL TEST
  GROUPS WITH DIFFERENT INPUT\n\nExamples: <!-- keep synced with tests/examples -->\n\nAll
  delimiters explicit:\n\n    # cat copies its input to stdout\n    <\n    foo\n    $
  cat\n    >\n    foo\n\n    # or, given a bad flag, prints a platform-specific error
  and exits with non-zero status\n    $ cat --no-such-flag\n    >2 /(unrecognized|illegal)
  option/\n    >= !0\n\n    # echo ignores the input and prints a newline.\n    #
  We use an explicit >= (or >2) to delimit the whitespace which\n    # would otherwise
  be ignored.\n    $ echo\n    >\n\n    >=\n\nNon-required `<` and `>` delimiters
  omitted:\n\n    foo\n    $ cat\n    foo\n\n    $ cat --no-such-flag\n    >2 /(unrecognized|illegal)
  option/\n    >= !0\n\n    $ echo\n    >\n\n    >2\n\n[shelltestrunner](https://github.com/simonmichael/shelltestrunner/tree/master/tests/format3)\n\n##
