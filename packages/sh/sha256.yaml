  # Revision history for sha256

  ## 0.1.0.2 -- 2025-01-21

  * Duplicate a C function used from the hash-string package, because hackage's
    build infrastructure had a problem finding hs_hashstring_memcmp.h header file

  ## 0.1.0.1 -- 2025-01-20

  * Original release was accidentally categorized as Graphics, not Cryptography

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2025-01-20

  * Rewrite of the FFI portions of the cryptohash-sha256 bindings, in order
    to support precomputed HMAC keys, more efficient streaming and backtracking,
    bitstring inputs, (de)serialization of intermediate states, intermediate
    bytecounts, and more.

description: |-
  A modern binding to SHA256, HMAC, HKDF, and PBKDF2 supporting precomputed
  HMAC keys, streaming, backtracking, bitstring inputs, and (de)serialization
  of intermediate states.  Both HKDF and PBKDF2 reuse HMAC key computations
  for efficiency.
