description: |-
  A simple single-module library for creating lens field typeclasses in a way that allows them to be shared between modules.
  By default, lens' @makeFields@ creates a new class if it can't find a matching one in scope. This means that if you try to @makeFields@ records in different modules without importing one module into the other, you'll get conflicting class definitions rather than a single lens which functions with both records.
