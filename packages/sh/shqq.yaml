  This library provides a quasiquoter for executing shell commands in Haskell,
  somewhat similar to Perl's backtick operator.  Shell commands are IO actions,
  and they capture the command's standard output as a String result.  You can
  also interpolate Haskell variables into a command.

  Documentation is hosted at http://hackage.haskell.org/package/shqq

  To build the documentation yourself, run

    $ cabal configure && cabal haddock --hyperlink-source

  This will produce HTML documentation under dist/doc/html/shqq
