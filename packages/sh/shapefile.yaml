description: |-
  A very simple interface for processing data in ESRI
  shapefile format.  Includes functions for reading or
  writing whole .shp and .shx files, as well as for
  generating .shx index files from .shp data files.
  Also includes an interface to read individual records
  on-demand from shapefiles, useful for very large databases.
