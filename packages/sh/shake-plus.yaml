  ## v0.1.2.0

  ## v0.1.1.0

  * Make `Within` style functions more consistent in that they actually take `Within` values
    across the board.
  * Make `batchLoad` functions more consistent and usable.
  * `need` and `want` variants now take any `Traversable`.

  ## v0.1.0.0

  * Update to `within-0.1.1.0` which changes the data type to an `Env` comonad.
  * Drop the `loadSortFilterApply` loader functions in favour of a simpler
    `batchLoad` set of functions which accepts a loading function which can be
    cached.
  * Add enough documentation to get started.

  ## v0.0.2.1

  * Add functions based on [Within](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/path) to better
    keep track of source and target directories.
  * Reexport more shake functions to remove need to import vanilla shake qualified.
  * Add convenience functions `loadSortFilterApply` and `loadSortFilterApplyW` for batch
    loading via `MonadAction`.
  * Add more of the API surface with `Path` and `Within` including variants of `need`, `want`
    `readFile`, `writeFile`.

  ## v0.0.1.0

  * Initial sketch of shake-plus with reexported functions. Mostly oracles,
    filepaths and directory functions using
    [Path](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/path), and `MonadAction`,
    `MonadUnliftAction` and `MonadRules` with `ReaderT` transformers in a similar
    style to [RIO](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio)

  # Shake+ - Super Powered Shake

  Attempt at a batteries included Shake. We reexport replacements for the main
  utility functions of Shake with the following adjustments whereever possible.

  * Well-typed paths using the [path](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/path)
    library.
  * New type classes `MonadAction`, `MonadUnliftAction` and `MonadRules` with
    concrete `ReaderT` transformers:
    * `RAction r a = RAction (ReaderT r Action a)` and
    * `ShakePlus r a = ShakePlus (ReaderT r Rules a)`
  * `Text` instead of `String` wherever it is appropriate.

  ## Paths

  Using the [path](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/path) library is kind of a
  no brainer. I lose a lot of time to problems that could be avoided by using
  this library, so it's everywhere. The names for these functions shadow the
  existing names, so you may want to `import qualified Development.Shake` while
  this library progresses if you have other `FilePath` based Shake rules that
  you want to mix into your build.

  The standard `Development.Shake.FilePath` functions for directory manipulation
  are not re-exported in full, and you should use the functions in the path
  library (such as `replaceExtension`) and other path-based libraries. This will
  probably change.

  `FilePattern`s are kept as-is, as `Path` is strongly normalizing it makes
  sense to keep these as `Strings`.

  ## RAction

  The `ReaderT r Action a` transformer (called `RAction`) is similar to the
  [RIO](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio) type and should be used
  similarly. In fact, you can reuse the logging functions from `RIO` within any
  `RAction` block, which is one of the main motivators for having an `Action`
  which is also a `MonadReader`. If you need to reuse an existing shake
  `Action` in an `RAction`, use `liftAction`.

  ## runShakePlus

  The main entry point to this library is the `runShakePlus` function, which
  collapses a `ReaderT r Rules ()` to a `Rules ()` and passes the environment to
  each underlying `RAction`. The `r`s in `ShakePlus` and the underlying
  `RAction`s have to match. A typical setup might look like this.

  ```{.haskell}
  let r = --setup env here
  shake shakeOptions $ do

      -- include some regular shake rules.

      runShakePlus r $ do

        -- some shake-plus rules.
  ```
