  # Shake+ - Super Powered Shake

  Attempt at a batteries included Shake. We reexport replacements for the main
  utility functions of Shake with the following adjustments whereever possible.

  * Well-typed paths using the [path](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/path)
  * New type classes `MonadAction`, `MonadUnliftAction` and `MonadRules` with
    concrete `ReaderT` transformers:
    * `RAction r a = RAction (ReaderT r Action a)` and
    * `ShakePlus r a = ShakePlus (ReaderT r Rules a)`
  * `Text` instead of `String` wherever it is appropriate.
  * `within` style variants of the standard file and directory operations that
    in some cases return or accept `Within b (Path Rel File)` values to keep tags
  of parent directories.

  This is an early release and some things may be missing or broken, but so
  far the conveniences have been worth it. Some notes on the approach are
  detailed below.

  ## Paths

  Using the [path](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/path) library is kind of a
  no brainer. I lose a lot of time to problems that could be avoided by using
  this library, so it's everywhere. The names for these functions shadow the
  existing names, so you may want to `import qualified Development.Shake` while
  this library progresses if you have other `FilePath` based Shake rules that
  you want to mix into your build.

  The standard `Development.Shake.FilePath` functions for directory manipulation
  are not re-exported in full, and you should use the functions in the path
  library (such as `replaceExtension`) and other path-based libraries. This will
  probably change.

  `FilePattern`s are kept as-is, as `Path` is strongly normalizing it makes
  sense to keep these as `Strings`.

  ## RAction

  The `ReaderT r Action a` transformer (called `RAction`) is similar to the
  [RIO](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio) type and should be used
  similarly. In fact, you can reuse the logging functions from `RIO` within any
  `RAction` block, which is one of the main motivators for having an `Action`
  which is also a `MonadReader`. If you need to reuse an existing shake
  `Action` in an `RAction`, use `liftAction`.

  ## Using Within

  One common complaint about Shake is having to keep track of source and output
  directories and translating `FilePath`s when using the input to an `Action`,
  leading to lots of repetition of the form `(sourceFolder </>) . (-<.> ".ext") .
  dropDirectory1` which is prone to breakage. Using `Path` helps this to some
  degree, but in some cases is even more annoying because lots of `Path`
  functions use `MonadThrow`, leading to lots of monadic steps inside an
  `RAction`.

  To alleviate this somewhat, we use `Within b (Path Rel File)` as a standard
  pattern for representing a file within a directory. `Within` is a type
  available in the [within](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/within) package
  that is simply a newtype wrapper over an `Env` comonad with the environment
  specialized to `Path b Dir`. We provide variants of the file operations and
  rules that typically accept or return `Path`s or contain callbacks that expect
  paths and change these to `Within` values. These functions are generally
  suffixed `within`. Here is the variant of `getDirectoryFiles` that
  produces `Within` values.

  ```{.haskell}
  getDirectoryFilesWithin' :: MonadAction m => Path b Dir -> [FilePattern] -> m [Within b (Path Rel File)]
  ```

  You can convert to and from this within-style using `within` and `fromWithin`.

  ```{.haskell}
  let x = $(mkRelFile "a.txt") `within` $(mkRelDir "foo") -- Within Rel (Path Rel File)
  fromWithin x -- produces a `Path Rel File`
  ```

  and you can assert that an existing path lies in a directory by using `asWithin`, which throws
  if the directory is not a proper prefix of the `Path`.

  ```{.haskell}
  $(mkRelFile "foo/a.txt") `asWithin` $(mkRelDir "foo") -- fine
  $(mkRelFile "a.txt") `asWithin` $(mkRelDir "foo") -- throws error
  ```

  Filerules such as `(%>)` have within-style variants that accept an ` (Path b
  Dir) FilePattern` on the left and carry that env to the callback.

  ```{.haskell}
  (%^>) :: (Partial, MonadReader r m, MonadRules m) => Within Rel FilePattern -> (Within Rel (Path Rel File) -> RAction r ()) -> m ()
  ```

  You change the underlying filepath with `fmap` or `mapM`, whilst you can move
  to a new parent directory by using `localDir`, or `localDirM` which is defined
  in the `Within` library for when the map between parent directories may throw.
  The `Within` library also contains more functions and instances for more
  precise changes between output and source directories.

  ## runShakePlus

  The main entry point to this library is the `runShakePlus` function, which
  collapses a `ReaderT r Rules ()` to a `Rules ()` and passes the environment to
  each underlying `RAction`. The `r`s in `ShakePlus` and the underlying
  `RAction`s have to match. A typical setup might look like this.

  ```{.haskell}
  let r = --setup env here
  shake shakeOptions $ do

      -- include some regular shake rules.

      runShakePlus r $ do

        -- some shake-plus rules.
