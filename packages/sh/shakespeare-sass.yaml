  ## About

  Shakepeare SASS is a package to enable the usage of [SASS language](http://sass-lang.com)
  in the [Yesod web framework](http://yesodweb.com).

  ## Using Shakespeare SASS

  Adding SASS support to your Yesod website is, actually,
  quite simple and straight-forward.
  After adding `shakespeare-sass` into your `.cabal` file
  (and `stack.yaml` if you are using stack),
  all you have to do is change your `widgetFileSettings` in `Settings.hs`
  from `= def` to `= wfsSass ["sass_include/"]`.
  And, of course, `import Text.Shakespeare.Sass` at the beginning of the file.

  The argument for `wfsSass` function is a list of directories relative to
  the project root where you want
  your `.sass` or `.scss` include files stored.
  The main SASS files will still reside in your `templates` directory,
  as it is with the default setup with `.lucius` files.
  That way you get to keep your mixins separate from the templates
  and have a clear directory structure.
  Of course, you can always add your `templates` directory
  to sass search path and keep everything in `templates` dir.

  ### Note about deployment with Keter

  In case you are using [Keter](https://github.com/snoyberg/keter) for deployment
  (and you should, it's a great tool),
  you should also add directories with your sass templates
  to the `extraFiles:` list in the `config/keter.yaml` file.
  Don't forget to put the `../` prefix, since `keter.yaml`'s paths are
  relative to the `config` directory.
