  * `cassiusMixin` added

  ### 2.0.2.2

  GHC 7.10 support

  ### shakesepare 2.0.2

  shakespeare-i18n supports message directories.

  ### Hamlet 0.5.0 (August 29, 2010)

  * Use can use parantheses when referencing variables. This allows you to have
  functions applied to multiple arguments.

  * Added the hamlet' and xhamlet' quasiquoters for generating plain Html
  values.

  * Added runtime Hamlet support.

  * Added "file debug" support. This is a mode that is a drop-in replacement for
  external files compiled via template haskell. However, this mode also has a
  runtime component, in that is reads your templates at runtime, thus avoiding
  the need to a recompile for each template change. This takes a runtime hit
  obviously, so it's recommended that you switch back to the compile-time
  templates for production systems.

  * Added the Cassius and Julius template languages for CSS and Javascript,
  respectively. The former is white-space sensitive, whereas the latter is just
  a passthrough for raw Javascript code. The big feature in both of them is that
  they support variable interpolation just like Hamlet does.

  ### New in Hamlet 0.4.0

  * Internal template parsing is now done via Parsec. This opened the doors for
  the other changes mentioned below, but also hopefully gives more meaningful
  error messages. There's absolutely no runtime performance hit for this change,
  since all parsing is done at compile time, and if there *is* any compile-time
  hit, it's too negligible to be noticed.

  * Attribute values can now be quoted. This allows you to embed spaces, periods
  and pounds in an attribute value. For example:
  [$hamlet|%input!type=submit!value="Add new value"|].

  * Space-delimited references in addition to period-delimited ones. This only
  applies to references in content, not in statements. For example, you could
  write [\$hamlet|\$foo bar baz\$|].

  * Dollar-sign interpolation is now polymorphic, based on the ToHtml typeclass.
  You can now do away with \$string.var\$ and simply type \$var\$. Currently, the
  ToHtml typeclass is not exposed, and it only provides instances for String and
  Html, though this is open for discussion.

  * Added hamletFile and xhamletFile which loads a Hamlet template from an
  external file. The file is parsed at compile time, just like a quasi-quoted
  template, and must be UTF-8 encoded. Additionally, be warned that the compiler
  won't automatically know to recompile a module if the template file gets
  changed.

description: |-
  Shakespeare is a family of type-safe, efficient template languages. Shakespeare templates are expanded at compile-time, ensuring that all interpolated variables are in scope. Variables are interpolated according to their type through a typeclass.

  Shakespeare templates can be used inline with a quasi-quoter or in an external file.

  Note there is no dependency on haskell-src-extras. Instead Shakespeare believes logic should stay out of templates and has its own minimal Haskell parser.

  Packages that use this: xml-hamlet
