description: |-
  This is a fairly simple implementation of a
  general-purpose spline library, just to get the code
  out there.  Its interface is still mildly unstable and
  may change (hopefully not drastically) as new needs or
  better style ideas come up.  Patches, suggestions
  and/or feature requests are welcome.
