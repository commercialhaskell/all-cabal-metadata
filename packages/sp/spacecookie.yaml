  # Revision history for spacecookie

  ## 1.0.0.0

  2021-03-16

  TL;DR:

  * For server users, new features and configuration options have been
    added, but old configuration stays compatible. However some gophermap
    files may need adjusting, especially if they contain absolute paths
    not starting with a slash.
  * For library users there are multiple braking changes to the core API
    that probably need adjusting in downstream usage as well as some
    changes to behavior.

  ### Server and Library Users

  #### Gophermap parsing

  There have been quite a few, partly breaking changes to gophermap parsing in
  the library in an effort to fully support the format used in pygopherd and
  bucktooth. Instances where spacecookie's parsing deviated from the established
  format have been resolved and we now ship a test suite which checks compliance
  against sample files from bucktooth and pygopherd.

  We now support relative paths correctly: If a selector in a gophermap doesn't
  start with `/` or `URL:` it is interpreted as a relative path and prefixed
  with the directory the gophermap is located in. This should make writing
  gophermaps much more convenient, as it isn't necessary to enter absolute
  selectors anymore. However, absolute selectors not starting with `/`
  are **broken** by this.

  To facilitate these changes, the API of `Network.Gopher.Util.Gophermap`
  changed in the following way:

  * `GophermapEntry` changed to use `GophermapFilePath` instead of `FilePath`
    which may either be `GophermapAbsolute`, `GophermapRelative` or `GophermapUrl`.
    Additionally, `GophermapFilePath` is a wrapper around `RawFilePath`, contrary
    to the previous use of `FilePath`.
  * `gophermapToDirectoryResponse` takes an additional parameter describing
    the directory the gophermap is located in to resolve relative to absolute
    selectors.

  See also [#22](https://github.com/sternenseemann/spacecookie/issues/22) and
  [#23](https://github.com/sternenseemann/spacecookie/pull/23).

  Menu lines which only contain a file type and name are now required to be
  terminated by a tab before the newline. This also reflects the behavior
  of bucktooth and pygopherd (although the latter's documentation on this
  is a bit misleading). Although this **breaks** entries like `0/file`,
  info lines which start with a valid file type character like
  `1. foo bar baz` no longer get mistaken for normal menu entries.
  See [#34](https://github.com/sternenseemann/spacecookie/pull/34).

  The remaining, less significant changes are:

  * Fixed parsing of gophermap files whose last line isn't terminated
    by a newline.
  * The `gophermaplineWithoutFileTypeChar` line type which mapped menu entries
    with incompatible file type characters to info lines has been removed. Such
    lines now result in a parse error. This is a **breaking change** if you
    relied on this behavior.
  * `parseGophermap` now consumes the end of input.

  #### Changes to Connection Handling

  * We now wait up to 1 second for the client to close the connection on
    their side after sending all data. This fixes an issue specific to
    `curl` which would result in it failing with a recv error (exit code
    56) randomly.
    See also [#42](https://github.com/sternenseemann/spacecookie/issues/42)
    and [#44](https://github.com/sternenseemann/spacecookie/pull/44).
  * Requests from clients are now checked more vigorously and limited
    in size and time to prevent denial of service attacks.
    * Requests may not exceed 1MB in size
    * The client is only given 10s to send its request
    * After the `\r\n` no additional data may be sent

  ### Server Users

  #### Configuration

  * Add new `listen` field to configuration allowing to specify the
    listening address and port. It expects an object with the fields
    `port` and `addr`. The top level `port` option has been *deprecated*
    as a result. It is now possible to bind to the link local address
    `::1` only without listening on public addresses.
    See [#13](https://github.com/sternenseemann/spacecookie/issues/13) and
    [#19](https://github.com/sternenseemann/spacecookie/pull/19).
  * Log output is now configurable via the new `log` field in the
    configuration. Like `listen` it expects an object which supports the
    following fields.
    See [#10](https://github.com/sternenseemann/spacecookie/issues/10) and
    [#20](https://github.com/sternenseemann/spacecookie/pull/20).
    * `enable` allows to enable and disable logging
    * `hide-ips` can be used to hide private information of users from
      log output. This is *now enabled by default*.
    * `hide-time` allows to hide timestamps if your log setup already
      takes care of that.
    * `level` allows to switch between `error` and `info` log level.
  * Make `port` and `listen` → `port` settings optional, defaulting to 70.

  Config parsing should be backwards compatible. Please open a bug report if
  you experience any problems with that or any constellation of the new
  settings.

  #### Other changes

  * A not allowed error is now generated if there are any dot directories or
    dot files along the path: `/foo/.dot/bar` would now generate an error
    instead of being processed like before.
  * GHC RTS options are now enabled and the default option `-I10` is passed to
    spacecookie.
  * Exit if dropping privileges fails instead of just logging an error like before.
    See [#45](https://github.com/sternenseemann/spacecookie/pull/45).
  * Expand user documentation by adding three man pages
    ([rendered](https://sternenseemann.github.io/spacecookie/)) on the server daemon:
    * `spacecookie(1)`: daemon invocation and behavior
    * `spacecookie.json(5)`: daemon configuration
    * `spacecookie.gophermap(5)`: gophermap format documentation
  * Fix the file not found error message erroneously stating that access of that
    file was not permitted.
  * Clarify error message when an URL: selector is sent to spacecookie.
  * Print version when `--version` is given
  * Print simple usage instructions when `--help` is given or the command line
    can't be parsed.
  * A warning is now logged when a gophermap file doesn't parse and the standard
    directory response is used as fallback.

  ### Library Users

  ### New Representation of Request and Response

  The following changes are the most significant to the library as they
  break virtually all downstream usage of spacecookie as a library.

  The gopher request handler for the `runGopher`-variants now receives
  a `GopherRequest` record representing the request instead of the
  selector as a `String`. The upsides of this are as follows:

  * Handlers now know the IPv6 address of the client in question
  * Simple support for search transaction is introduced as the request
    sent by the client is split into selector and search string.
  * Selectors are no longer required to be UTF-8 as `ByteString` is used.

  If you want to reuse old handlers with minimal adjustments you can
  use a snippet like the following. Note though that you might have
  to make additional adjustments due to the changes to responses.

      wrapLegacyHandler :: (String -> GopherResponse)
                        -> (GopherRequest -> GopherResponse)
      wrapLegacyHandler f = f . uDecode . requestSelectorRaw

  Corresponding to the switch to `ByteString` in `GopherRequest` the
  whole API now uses `ByteString` to represent paths and selectors.
  This prompts the following additional, breaking changes:

  * `ErrorResponse` now uses a `ByteString` instead of a `String`.
  * `GopherMenuItem`'s `Item` now uses a `ByteString` instead of a `FilePath`
    (you can use `encodeFilePath` from `filepath-bytestring` to fix downstream
    usage).
  * `sanitizePath` and `sanitizeIfNotUrl` now operate on `RawFilePath`s
    (which is an alias for `ByteString`).
  * As already mentioned, the gophermap API uses `RawFilePath`s instead
    of `FilePath`s as well.

  See also [#38](https://github.com/sternenseemann/spacecookie/pull/38)
  and [#26](https://github.com/sternenseemann/spacecookie/issues/26).

  #### Logging

  The built-in logging support has been removed in favor of a log handler the
  user can specify in `GopherConfig`. This is a **breaking change** in two ways:

  * The type of `GopherConfig` changed as it has a new field called
    `cLogHandler`.
  * By default (`defaultGopherConfig`) the spacecookie library no longer
    has logging enabled.

  The motivation for this was to enable the library user to influence the log
  output more. More specifically the following abilities were to be made
  possible for the bundled server daemon:

  * It should be possible to hide timestamps in the log output: If you are
    using systemd for example, the journal will take care of those.
  * There should be the ability to hide sensitive information from the log
    output: Unless necessary client IP addresses shouldn't be logged to
    disk.
  * The log output should be filterable by log level.
  * It should be easy for server implementation to also output log messages
    via the same system as the `spacecookie` library.

  The best solution to guarantee these properties (and virtually any you could
  want) is to let the library user implement logging. This allows any target
  output, any kind of logging, any kind of clock interaction to generate
  timestamps (or not) etc. This is why the spacecookie library no longer
  implements logging. Instead it lets you configure a `GopherLogHandler`
  which may also be used by the user application (it is a simple `IO`
  action). This additionally scales well: In the simplest case this could
  be a trivial wrapper around `putStrLn`.

  The second part to the solution is `GopherLogStr` which is the string type
  given to the handler. Internally this is currently implemented as a `Seq`
  containing chunks of `Builder`s which are coupled with meta data. This
  should allow decent performance in building and rendering of `GopherLogStr`s.
  The latter of which is relatively convenient using `FromGopherLogStr`.

  The tagged chunks are used to allow a clean implementation of hiding sensitive
  data: `makeSensitive` can be used to tag all chunks of a `GopherLogStr` which
  will then be picked up by `hideSensitive` which replaces all those chunks
  with `[redacted]`. This way sensitive information can be contained inline in
  strings and users can choose at any given point whether it should remain there
  or be hidden.

  The new logging mechanism was implemented in
  [#29](https://github.com/sternenseemann/spacecookie/pull/29).

  Previously it was attempted to make built-in logging more configurable
  (see [#13](https://github.com/sternenseemann/spacecookie/issues/13) and
  [#19](https://github.com/sternenseemann/spacecookie/pull/19)), but this
  was overly complicated and not as flexible as the new solution. Therefore
  it was scrapped in favor of the new system.

  #### Other Changes

  * `cRunUserName` has been removed from `GopherConfig` since the functionality
    doesn't need special treatment as users can implement it easily via the
    ready action of `runGopherManual`. The formerly internal `dropPrivileges`
    function is now available via `Network.Gopher.Util` to be used for this
    purpose. See [#45](https://github.com/sternenseemann/spacecookie/pull/45).
    This is a **breaking change** and requires adjustment if you used the built
    in privilege deescalation capabilities.
  * `santinizePath` and `santinizeIfNotUrl` have been corrected to `sanitizePath`
    and `sanitizeIfNotUrl` respectively. This is a **breaking change** to the
    interface of `Network.Gopher.Util`.

  ## 0.2.1.2 Bump fast-logger

  2020-05-23

  * Bump fast-logger dependency, fix build

  ## 0.2.1.1 Fixed Privilege Dropping

  2019-12-10

  * Server
    * Make `user` parameter in config optional. If it is not given or set to `null`, `spacecookie` won't attempt
      to change its UID and GID. This is especially useful, if socket activation is used. In that case it is not
      necessary to start spacecookie as `root` since systemd sets up the socket, so `spacecookie` can be already
      started by the right user and doesn't need to change UID.
    * Example Systemd config files
      * `SocketMode` is now `660` instead of default `666`.
      * Set `User` and `Group` for `spacecookie.service` as well.
      * Set `"user": null` in `spacecookie.json`
  * Library
    * Fixed issue that led to `runGopher*` trying to change UID even if it wasn't possible (not running as root).
      This especially affected the `spacecookie` server, since `cRunUserName` would always be `Just`.
    * Made logging related to `dropPrivileges` clearer.

  ## 0.2.1.0 Systemd Support

  2019-10-20

  * Improved systemd support.
    * Support for the notify service type
    * Support for socket activation and socket (fd) storage
    * To make use of these new features you'll have to update your service files
  * Added `defaultConfig` value to prevent future breakage in software using the
    library when the `GopherConfig` type is extended.
  * Pretty print IPv6 addresses in logging

  ## 0.2.0.1 Hackage release

  2019-05-23

  Fixed a problem hindering the hackage release.

  ## 0.2.0.0 initial release

description: "# spacecookie\n\nHaskell gopher server daemon and library.\n\n## Features\n\n*
  implements RFC1436\n* optionally supports common protocol extensions:\n  * informational
  entries via the `i`-type\n  * [`h`-type and URL entries](http://gopher.quux.org:70/Archives/Mailing%20Lists/gopher/gopher.2002-02%7C/MBOX-MESSAGE/34)\n*
  supports gophermaps (see [below](#adding-content))\n* supports systemd socket activation\n*
  provides a library for custom gopher applications ([see documentation](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/spacecookie/docs/Network-Gopher.html))\n\n##
  Non-Features\n\nspacecookie intentionally does not support:\n\n* HTTP, Gemini: Multi
  protocol support is a non-goal for spacecookie.\n  For HTTP you can [proxy](https://github.com/sternenseemann/gopher-proxy)\n
  \ pretty easily, however.\n* Search: Gopher supports search transactions, but the
  spacecookie daemon doesn't offer\n  the possibility to add a search engine to a
  gopherspace. It is however\n  entirely possible to implement an index search server
  using [the\n  spacecookie library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/spacecookie/docs/Network-Gopher.html)\n\n##
  Installation\n\n* Nix(OS): [`pkgs.haskellPackages.spacecookie`](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&query=spacecookie)\n
  \ (see also [below](#on-nixos))\n* Cabal: `cabal v2-install spacecookie`\n  (see
  also [hackage package](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/spacecookie))\n\n## Documentation\n\n*
  User Documentation: [spacecookie(1)](https://sternenseemann.github.io/spacecookie/spacecookie.1.html)\n*
  [Developer Documentation](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/spacecookie)\n\n##
  Configuration\n\nspacecookie is configured via a JSON configuration file.\nAll available
  options are documented in\n[spacecookie.json(5)](https://sternenseemann.github.io/spacecookie/spacecookie.json.5.html).\nThis
  repository also contains an example configuration file in\n[`etc/spacecookie.json`](./etc/spacecookie.json).\n\n##
  Running\n\nAfter you've created your config file just start spacecookie like this:\n\n\tspacecookie
  /path/to/spacecookie.json\n\nspacecookie runs as a simple process and doesn't fork
  or write a PID file.\nTherefore any supervisor (systemd, daemontools, ...) can be
  used to run\nit as a daemon.\n\n### With systemd\n\nspacecookie supports systemd
  socket activation. To set it up you'll need\nto install `spacecookie.service` and
  `spacecookie.socket` like so:\n\n\tcp ./etc/spacecookie.{service,socket} /etc/systemd/system/\n\tsystemctl
  daemon-reload\n\tsystemctl enable spacecookie.socket\n\tsystemctl start  spacecookie.socket\n\tsystemctl
  start  spacecookie.service # optional, started by the socket automatically if needed\n\nOf
  course make sure that all the used paths are correct!\n\nHow the systemd integration
  works is explained in\n[spacecookie(1)](https://sternenseemann.github.io/spacecookie/spacecookie.1.html#SYSTEMD_INTEGRATION).\n\n###
  On NixOS\n\n[NixOS](https://nixos.org/nixos/) provides a service module for spacecookie:\n[`services.spacecookie`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/nixos/modules/services/networking/spacecookie.nix).\nSetting
  up spacecookie is as simple as adding the following line to your `configuration.nix`:\n\n\tservices.spacecookie.enable
  = true;\n\nFor all available options, refer to the NixOS manual:\n\n* [NixOS stable](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/options.html#opt-services.spacecookie.enable)\n*
  [NixOS unstable](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/unstable/options.html#opt-services.spacecookie.enable)\n\n##
  Adding Content\n\nspacecookie acts as a simple file server, only excluding files\nor
  directories that start with a dot. It generates gopher menus\nautomatically, but
  you can also use custom ones by adding a\ngophermap file.\n\nspacecookie checks
  for `.gophermap` in every directory it serves and,\nif present, uses the menu specified
  in there.\n\nSuch a file looks like this:\n\n\tYou can just start writing text that\n\twill
  be displayed by the gopher client\n\twithout a link to a file. Empty lines are\n\talso
  possible.\n\n\t1Menu Entry for a directory full of funny stuff\t/funny\n\tIFunny
  Image\t/funny.jpg\n\tgcat gif\t/cat.gif\n\t0about me\t/about.txt\n\t1Floodgap's
  gopher server\t/\tgopher.floodgap.com\t70\n\nAs you can see, it largely works like
  the actual gopher menu a server will\nsend to clients, but allows to omit redundant
  information and to insert\nlines that are purely informational and not associated
  with a file.\n[spacecookie.gophermap(5)](https://sternenseemann.github.io/spacecookie/spacecookie.gophermap.5.html)\nexplains
  syntax and semantics in more detail.\n\nThe format is compatible with the ones supported
  by\n[Bucktooth](gopher://gopher.floodgap.com/1/buck/) and\n[pygopherd](https://github.com/jgoerzen/pygopherd).\nIf
  you notice any incompatibilities, please open an issue.\n\n## Portability\n\nspacecookie
  is regularly tested on GNU/Linux via CI, but\nshould also work on other Unix-like
  operating systems.\nMost portability problems arise due to\n[haskell-socket](https://github.com/lpeterse/haskell-socket)\nwhich
  is for example known\n[not to work on OpenBSD](https://github.com/lpeterse/haskell-socket/issues/63).\n\nWindows
  support would be possible, but could be tricky as gopher\nexpects Unix-style directory
  separators in paths. I personally\ndon't want to invest time into it, but would
  accept patches adding\nWindows support.\n"
