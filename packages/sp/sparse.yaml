changelog: |
  0.9.2
  -----
  * Rather dramatic memory usage reduction.
  * Dependency bumps

  0.9.1
  -----
  * `contravariant 1` support

  0.9
  ---
  * `lens 4` support

  0.7.0.1
  -------
  * Consolidated the tutorial under on "slug" on the FP Complete site, this broke all of the URLs in the 0.7 documentation.

  0.7
  ---
  * Switched to using an internal vector type that unboxes as much as it can. This lets type inference work much better when playing around at the ghci REPL.

  0.6
  ---
  * Version bumped to exceed the # of Hans Hoglund's `sparse` package. He started and released his library during the creation of this library, but graciously offered to let me take over the name. His library is now on hackage as `sparser`.

  0.1
  ---
  * Repository initialized.
