  ## Synopsis ##

  This is a Haskell library providing effective representation for [sparse matrices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) and some linear algebra on them.

  ## Installation ##

  1. Dowload it:

      ```bash
      $ git clone git://github.com/laughedelic/sparse-lin-alg.git
      ```

  2. Install

      ```bash
      $ cd sparse-lin-alg
      $ cabal install
      ```

  That's it!

  There are some QuickCheck tests, but at the moment they don't cover whole library.

  ## Documentation ##

  If you run `cabal haddock` in the directory, where you downloaded library, you'll get documentation and will be able to view it from the root at `dist/doc/html/sparse-lin-alg/index.html`.

  You can also view it online at [Hackage package page](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/sparse-lin-alg), but it may be not up to date.
