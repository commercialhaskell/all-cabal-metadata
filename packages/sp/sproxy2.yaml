synopsis: Secure HTTP proxy for authenticating users via OAuth2
changelog: |+
  1.97.1
  ======

    * Update for newer network library (>= 3.0.0.0) where `inet_addr` has been removed.


  1.97.0
  ======

    * Added new option `timeout` to configure backend response timeout.

    * Changed default random key length to 64 bytes (from 32).


  1.96.0
  ======

    * Added support for Yandex (https://tech.yandex.com/oauth/).

    * Encode full URL (including protocol) into the state parameter,
      not just path.  This makes it possible to work with OAuth2 providers
      that do not support multiple callback URL, like Yandex.

    * Fixed POST requests for tokens with Google and LinkedIn. They
      were mistakenly using URL paramaters instead of URL-encoded bodies.


  1.95.0
  ======

    * Add end-point for checking access in a bunch (`/.sproxy/access`).

    * Respond with 502 (Bad Gateway) on any backend error.
      Previously it was 500 (Internal Server Error).


  1.94.1
  ======

    * Fixed a typo introduced in version 1.94.0 in SQL query:
      `... WHERE domain = domain ...` -> `... WHERE domain = :domain ...`


  1.94.0
  ======

    * BREAKING: Disregard possible port in the Host HTTP header.
      Previously, Sproxy took possible port number into account when
      looking for backend and privileges. Now it ignores port and considers
      domain name only.  This also gets Sproxy in line with browsers and SSL
      certificates: certificates do not include port numbers, browsers ignore
      ports when sending cookies.

    * BREAKING: no SQL wildcards (`%` or `_`) in domain names when looking up
      for privileges.  This feature was ambiguous (in the same way as paths are)
      and never used anyway.


  1.93.0
  ======

    * BREAKING: Allow `!include` in config file.
      This changes semantics of options `key` and `oauth2.<provider>.client_secret`.
      They are no longer files, but strings.  To read content from files, use
      !include.  The point of being files or read from files is to segregate secrets
      from non-sensitive easily discoverable settings.  With `!include` it is much more
      simple and flexible.


  1.92.0
  ======

    * Allow running in plain HTTP mode (no SSL). Useful when Sproxy is behind some
      other proxy or load-balancer. Added two more options: `ssl` (defaults to true)
      and `https_port` (defaults to like `listen`). Options `ssl_key` and `ssl_cert`
      are required only if `ssl == true`. SSL-terminations is still required at upstream
      proxies, because the cookie is set for HTTPS only.

    * Added "user" table into `sproxy.sql`. No action is required, but PostgreSQL database
      built after this file will be incompatible with Sproxy Web ( <= 0.4.1 at least).


  1.91.0
  ======

    * In addition to good old PostgreSQL data source, made it possible
      to import permission data from a YAML file. This means that Sproxy2
      can work without any PostgreSQL database, just using file-only configuration.
      Useful for development or trivial deployments. Added new `datafile` option
      in configuration file.


  1.90.2
  ======

    * Make sure all Sproxy-specific HTTP headers are UTF8-encoded.

    * `/.sproxy/logout` just redirects if no cookie. Previously
      it was returning HTTP 404 to unauthenticated users, and redirecting
      authenticated users with removal of the cookie. The point is not to
      reveal cookie name.

    * Made Warp stop printing exceptions, mostly "client closed connection",
      which happens outside of our traps.


  1.90.1
  ======

    * Fixed headers processing. Wrong headers were making Chromium drop connection in HTTP/2.
      Firefox sometimes couldn't handle gzipped and chunked responses in HTTP/1.1.

    * After authenticating, redirect to original path with query parameters if
      method was GET.  Otherwise redirect to "/". Previously, when unauthenticated
      users click on "https://example.net/foo?bar", they are redirected to
      "https://example.net/foo" regardless of the method.



  1.90.0 (Preview Release)
  ========================

  Sproxy2 is overhaul of original [Sproxy](https://github.com/zalora/sproxy)
  (see also [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sproxy)).
  Here are the key differences (with Sproxy 0.9.8):

    * Sproxy2 can work with remote PostgreSQL database. Quick access to the database is essential
      as sproxy does it on every HTTP request. Sproxy2 pulls data into local SQLite3 database.

    * At this release Sproxy2 is compatible with Sproxy database with one exception:
      SQL wildcards are not supported for HTTP methods. I. e. you have to change '%' in
      the database to specific methods like GET, POST, etc.

    * OAuth2 callback URLs changed: Sproxy2 uses `/.sproxy/oauth2/:provider`,
      e. g. `/.sproxy/oauth2/google`. Sproxy used `/sproxy/oauth2callback` for Google
      and `/sproxy/oauth2callback/linkedin` for LinkedIn.

    * Sproxy2 does not allow login with email addresses not known to it.

    * Sproxy2: OAuth2 callback state is serialized, signed and passed base64-encoded.
      Of course it's used to verify the request is legit.

    * Sproxy2: session cookie is serialized, signed and sent base64-encoded.

    * Path `/.sproxy` belongs to Sproxy2 completely. Anything under this path is never passed to backends.

    * Sproxy2 supports multiple backends. Routing is based on the Host HTTP header.

    * Sproxy2 uses [WAI](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai) / [Warp](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/warp)
      for incoming connections. As a result Sproxy2 supports HTTP2.

    * Sproxy2 uses [HTTP Client](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-client) to talk to backends.
      As a result Sproxy2 reuses backend connections instead of closing them after each request to the backend.

    * Sproxy2 optionally supports persistent key again (removed in Sproxy 0.9.2).
      This can be used in load-balancing multiple Sproxy2 instances.

    * Configuration file has changed. It's still YAML, but some options are renamed, removed or added.
      Have a look at well-documented [sproxy.example.yml](./sproxy.example.yml)

  # Sproxy2

  HTTP proxy for authenticating users via OAuth2.


  ## Motivation

  This is overhaul of original [Sproxy](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sproxy).
  See [ChangeLog.md](./ChangeLog.md) for the differences.

  Why use a proxy for doing OAuth2? Isn't that up to the application?

   * sproxy is secure by default.  No requests make it to
     the web server if they haven't been explicitly whitelisted.
   * sproxy is independent.  Any web application written in
     any language can use it.

  ## Use cases

   * Existing web applications with concept of roles. For example,
     [Mediawiki](https://www.mediawiki.org), [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io),
     [Icinga Web 2](https://www.icinga.org/products/icinga-web-2/). In
     this case you configure Sproxy to allow unrestricted access
     to the application for some groups defined by Sproxy. These
     groups are mapped to the application roles.  There is a [plugin for
     Jenkins](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Reverse+Proxy+Auth+Plugin)
     which can be used for this. Mediawiki and Icinga Web 2 were also
     successfully deployed in this way, though it required changes to their
     source code.

   * New web applications designed to work specifically behind Sproxy. In this case
     you define Sproxy rules to control access to the
     application's API.  It would likely be [a single-page
     application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application).
     Examples are [MyWatch](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mywatch) and
     [Juan de la Cosa](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/juandelacosa).

   * Replace HTTP Basic authentication.


  How it works
  ============

  When an HTTP client makes a request, Sproxy checks for a *session cookie*.
  If it doesn't exist (or it's invalid, expired), it responses with [HTTP
  status 511](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585) with the page, where the
  user can choose an [OAuth2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) provider to
  authenticate with.  Finally, we store the the email address in a session
  cookie: signed with a hash to prevent tampering, set for HTTP only (to prevent
  malicious JavaScript from reading it), and set it for secure (since we don't
  want it traveling over plaintext HTTP connections).

  From that point on, when sproxy detects a valid session cookie it extracts the
  email, checks it against the access rules, and relays the request to the
  back-end server (if allowed).


  Permissions system
  ------------------
  Permissions are stored in internal SQLite3 database and imported
  from data sources, which can be a PostgreSQL database or a file.  See
  [sproxy.sql](./sproxy.sql) and [datafile.example.yml](./datafile.example.yml)
  for details.

  Do note that Sproxy2 fetches only `group_member`, `group_privilege`
  and `privilege_rule` tables, because only these tables are used for
  authorization. The other tables in PostgreSQL schema serve for data
  integrity. Data integrity of the data file is not verfied, though import
  may fail due to primary key restrictions.

  Only one data source can be used. The data in internal database, if any,
  is fully overwritten by the data from a data source. If no data source is
  specified, the data in internal database remains unchanged, even between
  restarts.  Broken data source is _not_ fatal. Sproxy will keep using existing
  internal database, or create a new empty one if missed. Broken data source
  means inability to connect to PostgreSQL database, missed datafile, etc.

  The data from a PostgreSQL database are periodically fetched into the internal
  database, while the data file is read once at startup.

  Here are the main concepts:

  - A `group` is identified by a name. Every group has
    - members (identified by email address, through `group_member`) and
    - associated privileges (through `group_privilege`).
  - A `privilege` is identified by a name _and_ a domain. It has associated rules
    (through `privilege_rule`) that define what the privilege gives access to.
  - A `rule` is a combination of sql patterns for a `domain`, a `path` and an
    HTTP `method`. A rule matches an HTTP request, if all of these components
    match the respective attributes of the request. However of all the matching
    rules only the rule with the longest `path` pattern will be used to determine
    whether a user is allowed to perform a request. This is often a bit
    surprising, please see the following example:


  Privileges example
  ------------------

  Consider this `group_privilege` and `privilege_rule` relations:

  group            | privilege | domain
  ---------------- | --------- | -----------------
  `readers`        | `basic`   | `wiki.example.com`
  `readers`        | `read`    | `wiki.example.com`
  `editors`        | `basic`   | `wiki.example.com`
  `editors`        | `read`    | `wiki.example.com`
  `editors`        | `edit`    | `wiki.example.com`
  `administrators` | `basic`   | `wiki.example.com`
  `administrators` | `read`    | `wiki.example.com`
  `administrators` | `edit`    | `wiki.example.com`
  `administrators` | `admin`   | `wiki.example.com`

  privilege   | domain             | path           | method
  ----------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ------
  `basic`     | `wiki.example.com` | `/%`           | `GET`
  `read`      | `wiki.example.com` | `/wiki/%`      | `GET`
  `edit`      | `wiki.example.com` | `/wiki/edit/%` | `GET`
  `edit`      | `wiki.example.com` | `/wiki/edit/%` | `POST`
  `admin`     | `wiki.example.com` | `/admin/%`     | `GET`
  `admin`     | `wiki.example.com` | `/admin/%`     | `POST`
  `admin`     | `wiki.example.com` | `/admin/%`     | `DELETE`

  With this setup, everybody (that is `readers`, `editors` and `administrators`s)
  will have access to e.g. `/imgs/logo.png` and `/favicon.ico`, but only
  administrators will have access to `/admin/index.php`, because the longest
  matching path pattern is `/admin/%` and only `administrator`s have the `admin`
  privilege.

  Likewise `readers` have no access to e.g. `/wiki/edit/delete_everything.php`.


  Keep in mind that:

  - Domains are converted into lower case (coming from a data source or HTTP requests).
  - Emails are converted into lower case (coming from a data source or OAuth2 providers).
  - Groups are case-sensitive and treated as is.
  - HTTP methods are *case-sensitive*.
  - HTTP query parameters are ignored when matching a request against the rules.
  - Privileges are case-sensitive and treated as is.
  - SQL wildcards (`_` and `%`) are supported for emails, paths (this _will_ change in future versions).


  Checking access in a bunch
  --------------------------

  There is an API end-point for checking access rights in a single POST query:
  `/.sproxy/access`.  Users should be authenticated to use this end-point,
  otherwise the respond will be HTTP 511.

  The request body shall be a JSON object like this:

  ```json
  {
    "tag1": {"path": "/foo", "method": "GET"},
    "tag2": {"path": "/bar", "method": "GET"}
  }
  ```

  And the respond will contain a JSON array with tag matching path and method
  pairs allowed to the user.  For example:

  ```sh
  $ curl -d '{"foo": {"path":"/get", "method":"GET"}, "bar": {"path":"/post", "method":"POST"}}' -XPOST -k 'https://example.ru:8443/.sproxy/access' ...
  ["foo","bar"]

  $ curl -d '{"foo": {"path":"/get", "method":"POST"}, "bar": {"path":"/post", "method":"POST"}}' -XPOST -k 'https://example.ru:8443/.sproxy/access' ...
  ["bar"]

  $ curl -d '{"foo": {"path":"/", "method":"POST"}, "bar": {"path":"/post", "method":"GET"}}' -XPOST -k 'https://example.ru:8443/.sproxy/access' ...
  []

  ```


  Logout
  ------

  Hitting the endpoint `/.sproxy/logout` will invalidate the session cookie.
  The user will be redirected to `/` after logout.


  Robots
  ------

  Since all sproxied resources are private, it doesn't make sense for web
  crawlers to try to index them. In fact, crawlers will index only the login
  page. To prevent this, sproxy returns the following for `/robots.txt`:

  ```
  User-agent: *
  Disallow: /
  ```


  HTTP headers passed to the back-end server
  ------------------------------------------

  All Sproxy headers are UTF8-encoded.


  header               | value
  -------------------- | -----
  `From:`              | visitor's email address, lower case
  `X-Groups:`          | all groups that granted access to this resource, separated by commas (see the note below)
  `X-Given-Name:`      | the visitor's given (first) name
  `X-Family-Name:`     | the visitor's family (last) name
  `X-Forwarded-Proto:` | the visitor's protocol of an HTTP request, always `https`
  `X-Forwarded-For`    | the visitor's IP address (added to the end of the list if header is already present in client request)


  `X-Groups` denotes an intersection of the groups the visitor belongs to and the groups that granted access:

  Visitor's groups | Granted groups | `X-Groups`
  ---------------- | -------------- | ---------
  all              | all, devops    | all
  all, devops      | all            | all
  all, devops      | all, devops    | all,devops
  all, devops      | devops         | devops
  devops           | all, devops    | devops
  devops           | all            | Access denied


  Requirements
  ============
  Sproxy2 is written in Haskell with [GHC](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/).
  All required Haskell libraries are listed in [sproxy2.cabal](sproxy2.cabal).
  Use [cabal-install](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Cabal-Install)
  to fetch and build all pre-requisites automatically.


  Configuration
  =============

  By default `sproxy2` will read its configuration from `sproxy.yml`.  There is
  example file with documentation [sproxy.example.yml](sproxy.example.yml). You
  can specify a custom path with:

  ```
  sproxy2 --config /path/to/sproxy.yml
  ```
