changelog: |
  # 0.4.0.1

  * Fixed a compiler warning.
  * Bumped dependencies.

  # 0.4.0.0

  # 0.3.0.0

  * Added `lucidT`.

  # 0.2.0.0

  * Changed types (the previous version was unusable).
  * Now the value returned by the Lucid action is *actually* returned.

  # 0.1.0.0 (deprecated)

  First release.
