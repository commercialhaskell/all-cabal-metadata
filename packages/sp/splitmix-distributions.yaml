  # splitmix-distributions

  Random samplers for some common distributions, as well as a convenient interface for composing them, based on `splitmix`.


  ## Usage

  Compose your random sampler out of simpler ones thanks to the Applicative and Monad interface, e.g. this is how you would declare and sample a binary mixture of Gaussian random variables:


      import Control.Monad (replicateM)
      import System.Random.SplitMix.Distributions (Gen, sample, bernoulli, normal)

      process :: Gen Double
      process = do
          coin <- bernoulli 0.7
          if coin
          then
              normal 0 2
          else
              normal 3 1

      dataset :: [Double]
      dataset = sample 1234 $ replicateM 20 process


  and sample your data in a pure (`sample`) or monadic (`sampleT`) setting.

  ## Implementation details

  The library is built on top of `splitmix`, so the caveats on safety and performance that apply there are relevant here as well.
