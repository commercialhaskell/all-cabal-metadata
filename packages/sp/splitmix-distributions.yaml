changelog: |+
  1.0

  - add MonadReader r (GenT m) instance
  - fixed MonadState (GenT m) instance via MonadTrans (i.e. as done in 'mtl')

  0.9 :

  - ensure it builds with ghc 8.6.5 (== stackage lts 14.27) as well
  - relax lower bound

  0.8 :

  - add `exceptions` dependency
  - add MonadThrow (GenT m) instance

  0.7 :

  - add sampleIO, samplesIO
  - clarify pure vs IO-based sampling in the docs

  0.6 :

  - add Chinese Restaurant Process

  0.5 :

  - add Log-normal, Laplace, Weibull distributions

  0.4 :

  - add Discrete, Categorical, Zipf-Mandelbrot distributions

  0.3 :

  - type signatures of all generators are now parametrized over some Monad m rather than Identity. This allows for more flexibility on the use site.

  0.2 :

  - add Pareto, Dirichlet, multinomial distributions

  # splitmix-distributions

  Random samplers for some common distributions, as well as a convenient interface for composing them, based on `splitmix`.


  ## Usage

  Compose your random sampler out of simpler ones thanks to the Applicative and Monad interface, e.g. this is how you would declare and sample a binary mixture of Gaussian random variables:


      import Control.Monad (replicateM)
      import System.Random.SplitMix.Distributions (Gen, sample, bernoulli, normal)

      process :: Gen Double
      process = do
          coin <- bernoulli 0.7
          if coin
          then
              normal 0 2
          else
              normal 3 1

      dataset :: [Double]
      dataset = sample 1234 $ replicateM 20 process


  and sample your data in a pure (`sample`) or monadic (`sampleT`) setting.

  ## Implementation details

  The library is built on top of `splitmix`, so the caveats on safety and performance that apply there are relevant here as well.
