changelog: |
  * 0.3.0.2 Libby Horacek <libby@positiondev.com> 2017-6-13

    - Update base dependencies to support GHC 8
    - Add a stack.yml for 8.15

  * 0.3.0.1.1 David Hartunian <david@positiondev.com> 2017-6-30

    - Add okJson helper for returning JSON strings as text

  * 0.3.0.1 Daniel Patterson <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2016-3-11

    - Change repository location, copyright.

  * 0.3.0.0 Daniel Patterson <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2016-3-2

    - Don't parse request body by default, to make `Fn` play well with
      others (that want to parse the body themself).
    - Add `!=>` connective that is like `==>`, but parses the request
      body. If you don't use `!=>`, patterns with `file` and `files`
      will fail. Also, `param` will only get query parameters.
    - Add `Route` type alias for the type of `pattern ==> handler`. This
      is partly for convenience and partly to make upgrades easier (in
      the event that the types change).
    - Change `FromParam` class to take a list of all parameters matching
      a given name, which allows us to implement a `Maybe` instance, a
      list instance, and make `paramMany` redundant (though currently
      left in, for compatibility). This also makes the ergonomics of
      using optional parameters better.
    - Fix bug where `staticServe` would allow you to break out of
      directory specified with `..`.

  * 0.2.0.2 Daniel Patterson <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2016-1-20

    - Fix for GHC 7.8, which cabal file said would work, but didn't.

  * 0.2.0.1 Daniel Patterson <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2015-12-4

    - Fix bug in url routing where "/foo/bar", "/foo/bar/", and
      "/foo//bar" were all treated differently.

  * 0.2.0.0 Daniel Pattersion <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2015-11-5

    - Changed to having our own `FnRequest` type, which is a WAI
      `Request` and the results of parsing the body for contents, since
      we need to be able to do that once and thread it through.
    - Add `file` and `files` matchers, which match against and pass file
      uploads to handlers.
    - Add `staticServe` to serve static files based on path.

  * 0.1.4.0 Daniel Pattersion <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2015-11-4

    - Move `ctxt` back to first parameter passed to handlers, via more
      continuations.

  * 0.1.3.1 Daniel Pattersion <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2015-10-31

    - Add `method` matcher to match against HTTP method.

  * 0.1.3.0 Daniel Patterson <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2015-10-30

    - Allow nested calls to `route`, by changing `Request` in
      `ctxt`. This necesitated changing it so that the `ctxt` is passed
      to handlers _last_, instead of first, because we need to have
      completed matching before we can change the request.
    - Add `anything` route matcher that matches anything.
    - Add `paramMany` matcher that returns a list of values for the
      given query param.
    - Change `param` to fail if more than one value is in query string.

  * 0.1.2.0 Daniel Pattersion <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2015-10-27

    - Rename `paramOptional` to `paramOpt`, to match `fn-extra`'s `Heist`
      naming of `attr` and `attrOpt`.
    - Remove `paramPresent`, because you
      can get that behavior by parsing to `Text`.

  * 0.1.1.0 Daniel Patterson <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2015-10-26

    - Rename `Param` class to `FromParam`.

  * 0.1.0.0 Daniel Patterson <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2015-10-25

    - Initial release.
