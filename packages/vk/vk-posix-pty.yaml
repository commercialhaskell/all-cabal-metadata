description: |-
  This package simplifies the creation of subprocesses that interact with
  their parent via a pseudo terminal (see @man pty@).

  Included @ptywrap@ utility spawns a process with a @pty@, forwards its
  output to stdout as plain text without buffering and forwards the exit code.
  Note that it __does not__ handle standard input.

  > ptywrap: usage: ptywrap [command to run]
