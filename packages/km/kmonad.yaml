  ## Unreleased

  ### Added

  ### Changed

  ### Fixed

  ## 0.4.3 – 2024-09-11

  ### Added

  - Added `stepped`. It performs the next button from a circular sequence
    whenever it is pressed.
  - Implemented named source blocks.
    To name a source block add `:name <name>` at the beginning of the
    `defsrc` block. To use it add `:source <name>` after the layer name to the
    `deflayer` block. (#831)
  - Added `around-only`, which works like `around` but releases the outer button
    when others are pressed. (#859)
  - Added `around-when-alone`, which also represses the outer button when only
    the inner button is pressed and all others have been released. (#859)
  - Allow customization of implicit `around`s (#859)

  ### Changed

  - Update Karabiner-DriverKit to 3.1.0 (#780)
  - Added tests to check that every button has documentation (#857)
  - `defsrc` with duplicate keycodes are now forbidden (#860)

  ### Fixed

  - Fixed crash on non-US backslash under MacOS (#766)
  - Fixed broken keyboard due to circular event handling under MacOS (#781)
  - Fixed crash on unhandled buttons by ignoring them (#807)
  - Fixed parse errors relating to whitespace (#796, #875)
  - Fixed broken compose sequences (#823, #869)
  - Fixed parse errors when using keys only available on Darwin OS (#828)
  - Fixed `around-next` wasn't parsable (#857)
  - Fixed most buttons which behave weird in nested tap situations (#873)

  ## 0.4.2 – 2023-10-07

  ### Added

  - Added `around-next-single`, a variant of `around-next` that will release its
    context on any change, as opposed to only on the release of the 'arounded'
    button.
  - Added default compose sequence for Ü
  - Added systemd user unit
  - Added runit startup script
  - Added short delay in startup
  - Added macOS 11.0 support
  - Added a `sticky-key`
  - Expanded documentation
  - Added `--version` (`-V`) flag
  - Added `+,` for  "add a cedilla"
  - Added `:timeout-button` keyword to `tap-hold-next` and
    `tap-hold-next-release`, so that they can switch to a button other than the
    hold button when the timeout expires.
  - Added openrc startup script

  ### Changed

  - Reorganized codebase
  - The `multi-tap` key now immediately taps the current key when another
    key is pressed during tapping.

  ### Fixed

  - Fixed compilation error under Mac, having to do with typo in Keycodes
  - Fixed issue with empty-names for uinput-sinks
  - Ignore SIGCHLD to deal with non-termination bug

  ## 0.4.1 - 2020-09-12

description: |-
  KMonad is a cross-platform command-line utility that runs as a daemon. It
  captures keyboard input (exactly how depends on the OS) and remaps it. The
  mapping is highly configurable, and provides options like (transparent) layer
  overlays, tap-mod buttons, multi-tap buttons, leader-key style buttons, and
  keyboard macros. Functionality heavily inspired by the QMK-firmware.
