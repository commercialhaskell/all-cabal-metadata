description: ! 'The `ip` package provides types and functions for dealing with

  IPv4 addresses, CIDR blocks, and MAC addresses. We provide instances

  for typeclasses found in commonly used packages like `aeson`, `vector`,

  and `hashable`. We also provide `Parser`s for working with attoparsec.


  Notably, this package does not overload functions by introducing any

  typeclasses of its own. Neither does it prefix functions with the name

  of the type that they work on. Instead, functions of the same name are

  exported by several different modules, and it is expected that end users

  disambiguate by importing these modules qualified. For example,

  `Data.IPv4.ByteString.Char8` and `Data.IPv4.Text` have nearly identical

  export lists.


  The only module intended to be imported unqualified is `Net.Types`. The

  types in this package should not conflict with the types in

  any other commonly used packages.


  The following packages are intended to be used with this package:


  * `yesod-ip`: Provides orphan instances needed to work with yesod and

  persistent. Also, provides a `yesod-form` helper.


  * `impure-containers`: Provides a trie that can be used for looking

  up which subnet an IP address belongs in.'
