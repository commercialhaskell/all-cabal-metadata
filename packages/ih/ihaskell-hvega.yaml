  For the latest version of this document, please see
  [https://github.com/DougBurke/hvega/blob/master/ihaskell-hvega/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/DougBurke/hvega/blob/master/ihaskell-hvega/CHANGELOG.md).

  ## 0.2.0.1

  Updated the supported `hvega` range to include version 0.3.

  ## 0.2.0.0

  Added the `vlShow` helper to allow Vega-Lite visualizations to be
  viewed directly in Jupyter lab (rather than Jupyter notebook).

  Try it out in [Tweag's jupyterWith environment](https://github.com/tweag/jupyterWith).

  ## 0.1.0.3

  The only change is to the cabal file, where `cabal-version: >=1.10` has
  been changed to `cabal-version: 1.18`. I honestly don't know what the
  minimum-supported version actually is (the version bump is to match
  that used by `hvega`.

  ## 0.1.0.2

  Updated the upper bounds of `aeson` to really allow v1.4. This was not
  released on Hackage.

  ## 0.1.0.1

  The source code has been moved to the `src` sub-directory to match the
  layout used by `hvega`.

  Several incorrect links in the cabal file have been fixed (as my GitHub
  user name is not actually `githubuser`).

  The cabal package now includes `stack.yaml` and `default.nix` (although
  the latter is *not* guaranteed to be correct), as well as a
  change log.

  Since `ihaskell` is now in Stackage, the LTS version has been updated
  to reflect this (to LTS 11.19), and the extra dependency removed.

  ## 0.1.0.0

  This is the initial version of `ihaskell-hvega`, and is released with
  `hvega` version 0.1.0.0.

  # ihaskell-hvega

  View [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) visualizations
  created by the `hvega` package in IHaskell notebooks.

  When used with Jupyter notebooks ut relies on
  [Vega-Embed](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/usage/embed.html) to
  do the hard work of parsing and displaying the Vega Lite specification.

  If run in a Jupyter Lab then the native Vega support is used for
  displaying the Vega Lite specifications. I recommend using
  [Tweag I/O's jupyterWith environment](https://github.com/tweag/jupyterWith)
  to set this up, and have a rudimentary
  [`shell.nix` example](https://github.com/DougBurke/hvega/blob/master/notebooks/shell.nix)
  in the
  [notebooks directory](https://github.com/DougBurke/hvega/tree/master/notebooks).
