  For the latest version of this document, please see
  [https://github.com/DougBurke/hvega/blob/master/ihaskell-hvega/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/DougBurke/hvega/blob/master/ihaskell-hvega/CHANGELOG.md).

  ## 0.5.0.5

  Support text 2.1 and IHaskell 0.11 (I am still not using IHaskell
  so there's no guarantee this will work).

  ## 0.5.0.4

  Support aeson 2.2. I have not been using IHaskell recently so I do
  not know if this even builds nowadays.

  ## 0.5.0.3

  Support aeson 2.1.

  ## 0.5.0.2

  Improve links in the haddock documentation. There are no code changes.

  ## 0.5.0.1

  Support text 2.0.

  ## 0.5.0.0

  Bump minimum supported IHaskell version to 0.10.

  ## 0.4.0.0

  Bump to support version hvega-0.12.0.0 and version 2.0 of aeson,
  although it will need updates to IHaskell components such as
  ipython-kernel before you can combine all the pieces.

  ## 0.3.2.0

  Bump to support version hvega-0.11.0.0.

  ## 0.3.1.0

  Bump to support version hvega-0.10.0.0.

  ## 0.3.0.0

  Support for the IHaskell notebook has been updated to version 4 of the
  Vega-Lite schema. Finally.

  Support for the Jupyter Lab interface remains stuck in a maze of
  very-twisty paths...

  ## 0.2.2.0 - 0.2.6.0

  Bump the maximum version of hvega.

  ## 0.2.1.0

  The module now exports the `VegaLiteLab` type (provided by Alexey
  Kuleshevich (lehins). This type is used to support display in Jupyter
  Lab as well as notebooks, and is a somewhat experimental feature.

  The module now builds without warnings on GHC 8.8.1.

  This release has been marked as compatible with version 0.4 of `hvega`,
  but **care should be taken** as it is possible to create visualizations
  that either do not display correctly, or do not display at all: these
  are visualizations that take advantages of Vega-Lite functionality
  not supported by the Javascript display code (presumably because
  of our use of an old Vega-Lite mimetype version in IHaskell; this
  will hopefuly be addressed once a version of IHaskell is released
  with support for
  [custom mimetypes](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell/issues/1089)).

  ## 0.2.0.2

  Updated the upper bounds of `ihaskell` to allow version 0.10.

  ## 0.2.0.1

  Updated the supported `hvega` range to include version 0.3.

  ## 0.2.0.0

  Added the `vlShow` helper to allow Vega-Lite visualizations to be
  viewed directly in Jupyter lab (rather than Jupyter notebook).

  Try it out in [Tweag's jupyterWith environment](https://github.com/tweag/jupyterWith).

  ## 0.1.0.3

  The only change is to the cabal file, where `cabal-version: >=1.10` has
  been changed to `cabal-version: 1.18`. I honestly don't know what the
  minimum-supported version actually is (the version bump is to match
  that used by `hvega`.

  ## 0.1.0.2

  Updated the upper bounds of `aeson` to really allow v1.4. This was not
  released on Hackage.

  ## 0.1.0.1

  The source code has been moved to the `src` sub-directory to match the
  layout used by `hvega`.

  Several incorrect links in the cabal file have been fixed (as my GitHub
  user name is not actually `githubuser`).

  The cabal package now includes `stack.yaml` and `default.nix` (although
  the latter is *not* guaranteed to be correct), as well as a
  change log.

  Since `ihaskell` is now in Stackage, the LTS version has been updated
  to reflect this (to LTS 11.19), and the extra dependency removed.

  ## 0.1.0.0

  This is the initial version of `ihaskell-hvega`, and is released with
  `hvega` version 0.1.0.0.

  # ihaskell-hvega

  View [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) visualizations
  created by the `hvega` package in IHaskell notebooks.

  When used with Jupyter notebooks it relies on
  [Vega-Embed](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/usage/embed.html) to
  do the hard work of parsing and displaying the Vega Lite specification.

  If run in a Jupyter Lab then the native Vega support is used for
  displaying the Vega Lite specifications. I recommend using
  [Tweag I/O's jupyterWith environment](https://github.com/tweag/jupyterWith)
  to set this up, and have a rudimentary
  [`shell.nix` example](https://github.com/DougBurke/hvega/blob/master/notebooks/shell.nix)
  in the
  [notebooks directory](https://github.com/DougBurke/hvega/tree/master/notebooks).

  This code is released under the BSD3 license.

  # Current status

  The display should work correctly when using the IHaskell `notebook`
  interface, supporting features included in Vega-Lite 4 (this is new to
  version 0.3, as earlier versions were limited to features in Vega-Lite
  3).

  Support for the Jupyter lab interface is **very limited** since there
  is a curious combination of IHaskell and Jupyter lab issues (including
  whether you are using v1.2 or v2). This is very annoying.
