description: ! 'This package provides a wrapper for functors, which allows their data
  to be

  automatically swapped to disk and loaded back when necessary. Although

  interaction with filesystem is required, whole interface (with exception of

  initialization) is pure and safe as long as no external manipulation with

  used database files happens while the program is running.

  Because only actual data, not indices (in Data.Map.Map, for example), are

  swapped and some accounting information are remembered for each item, this

  system is suitable mainly for situations where values are considerably

  larger then indices. Furthermore, creating complete snapshots to a file of

  this structure is supported; such snapshot can be then loaded, with

  individual values being read as they are requested.

  This package uses the Tokyo Cabinet <http://fallabs.com/tokyocabinet/>

  database, which needs to be installed on the system.

  A prototype of another data structure, SwapMap, is available in the git

  repository. It is similar to the Data.Map.Map and like Swapper allows

  transparent swapping of data to disk, but without requiring any accessory

  function and with the ability to swap both elements and indices. This one

  is, however, not complete and thus not provided here.'
