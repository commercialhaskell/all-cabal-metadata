changelog: "0.10.0.2:\n\n  Switched hosting from bitbucket to gitlab (and mercurial
  to\n  git). The new \"home\" location is https://gitlab.com/dburke/swish\n\n  Bumped
  base to a maximum of 4.14 to support GHC 8.8, and\n  bumped hashable to support
  version 1.3. Add conditional rules\n  to avoid warnings when building with GHC 8.8.\n\n0.10.0.1:\n\n
  \ Bump to support polyparse and its GHC 8.6 compatibility.\n\n0.10.0.0:\n\n  Updated
  packages to support building with ghc 8.6 (increase base\n  and containers limit).\n\n
  \ The reason for the version bump is that there has been some\n  internal build
  cleanup and removal of un-needed imports (thanks to\n  weeder), which was done a
  while ago and I now forget whether there\n  were any changes due to imported instances,
  so it is safer to\n  increase the minor version number. There has been *no* change
  to\n  functionality.\n\n  Default stack.yaml file is now ghc 8.4, and added a ghc
  8.2 version.\n\n0.9.2.1:\n\n  Updated the minimum base package to 4.5.0.0 (GHC 7.4.1),
  and removed\n  some old code for supporting older GHC/package versions. There are\n
  \ some warnings when compiling with GHC pre version 8 (redudant imports)\n  which
  I am currently too lazy to fix, but patches are welcome. Support\n  for building
  with older versions of GHC is on a best-effort basis.\n  Applied some HLint suggestions.
  Updated to allow time-1.9.1 (but not\n  time-1.9.0). Updated to lts 11.1 in stack.yaml.\n\n0.9.2.0:\n\n
  \ Initial support for ghc 8.4. Updated to lts 10.8 in stack.yaml so\n  was able
  to drop extra intern dependency version. Now builds with\n  -Wcompat if ghc 8.0
  or later is used.\n\n0.9.1.10:\n\n  Updated the upper bound on time to work with
  ghc 8.2.1. Updated\n  stack.yaml to use lts 9.1.\n\n0.9.1.9:\n\n  Updated the upper
  bound on HUnit. This only affects the tests.\n  Finally added a stack.yaml file
  (partly addressing issue #27).\n\n0.9.1.8:\n\n  Updated the upper bound on polyparse
  and directory. Fixed build\n  failure of RDFGraphTest with time >= 1.6. Updated
  the copyright\n  years in README.md.\n\n0.9.1.7:\n\n  Turns out one of the constraints
  is needed by GHC 7.6.\n\n0.9.1.6:\n\n  Updated dependencies to support GHC 8.0 (RC1)
  and updated the code to\n  remove the un-needed constraints pointed out to me by
  the new compiler.\n\n0.9.1.5:\n\n  Removed the developer flag as it causes problems
  with 'cabal upload'\n  and added 2015 to the copyright statement in the cabal file.
  There\n  are no code changes compared to 0.9.1.3.\n\n0.9.1.4:\n\n  Updated the upper
  bound on the semigroups and HUnit dependencies.\n  This never got released on hackage
  due to a disagreement between\n  myself and Cabal.\n\n0.9.1.3:\n\n  Updated ghc
  7.10 support.\n\n0.9.1.2:\n\n  Updated the upper bound on the polyparse dependency
  and fixed an\n  error in the Swish.RDF.Query documentation (issue #25). Initial\n
  \ support for ghc 7.10.\n\n  The list of changes has been removed from the cabal
  file since it\n  is in the CHANGELOG.\n\n0.9.1.1:\n\n  Updated the upper bound on
  the semigroups and polyparse dependencies.\n\n0.9.1.0:\n\n  The network-uri flag
  has been added, which uses the network-uri\n  package to provide Network.URI. This
  has lead to the minimum version\n  of the network package being bumped to 2.4.0.0
  to avoid some CPP\n  issues during building. The Network.URI.Ord module now really
  does\n  nothing.\n\n  Updated the upper bound on the text dependency (requires an\n
  \ update to intern to use).\n\n  Updated the upper bound on the time dependency
  to 1.5 (at this time\n  the test suite will not build due to a failing dependency,
  so\n  it is untested).\n\n0.9.0.15:\n\n  Updated the upper bound on the semigroups
  dependency.\n  Renamed README to README.md\n\n0.9.0.14:\n\n  Updated the upper bound
  on the network dependency.\n\n0.9.0.13:\n\n  Updated the upper bound on the semigroups
  dependency (Issue #20).\n\n0.9.0.12:\n\n  Updated the upper bound on the text dependency
  to include version\n  1.1 (requires an update to semigroups to use).\n\n0.9.0.11:\n\n
  \ Hackage has a better chance of finding the CHANGELOG file if it is\n  included
  in the distribution! There are no changes to the library or\n  examples.\n\n0.9.0.10:\n\n
  \ Renamed CHANGES to CHANGELOG in the hope it will get picked up by\n  Hackage.
  There are no changes to the library or examples.\n\n0.9.0.9:\n\n  Updated the upper
  bound on the semigroups dependency (thanks to Leif\n  Warner).\n\n  Updated the
  upper bound on the text dependency (however, requires\n  changes to intern and semigroups
  to use).\n\n0.9.0.8:\n\n  Updated the upper bound on the semigroups dependency (thanks
  to Leif\n  Warner).\n\n  Display library version when running the runw3ctests executable
  and\n  ensure there is a space between file name and test result in the\n  screen
  output.\n\n0.9.0.7\n\n  Minor documentation fix for Swish.RDF.Graph.quote.\n\n0.9.0.6:\n\n
  \ Turtle/N3 output: \\f characters in literals are converted to\n  \\u000C to work
  around some interoperability issues.\n\n  Changed the test handling to use test-framework.\n\n0.9.0.5:\n\n
  \ Turtle/N3 output: more changes for string literals containing\n  double-quote
  characters.\n\n  N3 Parser: parsing of string literals within three quote marks
  has\n  been updated to match the Turtle parser.\n\n  Turtle Parser: a few more error
  messages have been added.\n  \n0.9.0.4:\n\n  Turtle parser: updated to the Candidate
  Recommendation (19 February\n  2013) specification; added minor improvements to
  error messages when\n  given invalid syntax. As part of the upgrade, there is no
  longer a\n  default namespace set up for the empty prefix and numeric literals\n
  \ are no-longer converted into a 'canonical' form.\n\n  Turtle/N3 output: improved
  string formatting (better handling of\n  string literals with three or more consecutive
  \" characters); blank\n  node handling has been improved but the output may not
  be as elegant.\n\n  NTriples parser: now accepts upper-case language tags such as\n
  \ en-UK (case is preserved).\n\n  Swish.QName.LName names can now contain #, : and
  / characters.\n\n  Added tests for the Turtle parser and formatter.\n\n  The new
  w3ctests flag will build the runw3ctests executable,\n  which will run the W3C Turtle
  tests (if downloaded from\n  http://www.w3.org/2013/TurtleTests/).\n\n  Minor fixes
  and additions to the documentation.\n\n0.9.0.3:\n\n  Fix minor Haddock issue with
  Swish.RDF.Parser.Utils.appendURIs.\n\n0.9.0.2:\n\n  Updated the upper bound on the
  polyparse dependency.\n\n0.9.0.1:\n\n  Updated the upper bound on the semigroups
  dependency (thanks to Leif\n  Warner).\n\n0.9.0.0:\n\n  The module now builds against
  version 1.2 or 1.1 of the hashable\n  package; as there have been significant changes
  to hashable in the\n  1.2 release I have decided to bump up the version number to
  0.9\n  as a precaution.\n\n  Fix failing test on 64-bit GHC (no library change).\n\n
  \ Very minor hlint changes.\n\n0.8.0.3:\n\n  Remove hashtable restriction (rewrite
  tests), remove binary constraint\n  as it was apparently unneeded.\n\n  Updates
  to support network version 2.4.0.0: the package now provides\n  an Ord instance
  for Network.URI so Network.URI.Ord is now a no-op if\n  network >= 2.4.0.0 is installed;
  fix up code to handle change to\n  the API of relativeTo.\n\n0.8.0.2:\n\n  Restrict
  hashable to < 1.1.2.4 to try and avoid test\n  failures - see\n  http://travis-ci.org/#!/DougBurke/swish/builds/2360859\n
  \ This is a hack and the tests should be updated.\n\n  Updated directory constraint
  to allow 1.2 on ghc 7.6.\n\n0.8.0.1:\n\n  Internal changes to Turtle/N3 formatting.
  No user-visible changes.\n\n0.8.0.0:\n\n  The LDGraph class now uses Set (Arc lb),
  rather than [Arc lb], for\n  setArcs, getArcs, and update. Several data types -
  e.g. NSGraph -\n  now use sets rather than lists. There are a number of API tweaks
  -\n  e.g. the addition of Ord constraints and the removal of Functor,\n  Foldable,
  and Traversable instances. Not all list of Arcs have been\n  converted since a review
  is needed to see where it makes sense and\n  where it does not. This definitely
  speeds up some operations but\n  a full analysis has not been attempted.\n\n  Replaced
  used of Data.LookupMap with Data.Map.Map. This has led to\n  the removal of a number
  of language extensions from some modules.\n\n  Added Network.URI.Ord to provide
  an ordering for URIs.\n\n  A few other minor changes have been made: the removal
  of subset and\n  equiv from Swish.Utils.ListHelpers; the ordering used for RDFLabel\n
  \ values has changed; added a Monoid instance for VarBinding; added\n  Ord instances
  for a number of containers; removed some un-needed\n  constraints; added Network.URI.Ord.\n\n
  \ The containers upper limit has been increased to support version 0.5.\n\n0.7.0.2:\n\n
  \ Swish.QName.LName now requires all characters to be ASCII. This\n  avoids downstream
  later when trying to convert a QName to a URI.\n\n0.7.0.1:\n\n  URI parsing has
  changed slightly. The only user-visible change is that\n  error messages will be
  slightly different, in particular when\n  given an IRI in Turtle or NTriples format.
  Unfortunately IRIs are\n  still not supported.\n\n0.7.0.0:\n\n  For code that uses
  the Swish script language, the main change is to\n  import Swish rather than Swish.RDF.SwishMain,
  and to note that the\n  other Swish.RDF.Swish* modules are now called Swish.*.\n\n
  \ For code that uses the graph library, the main changes are that\n  Swish.RDF.RDFGraph
  is now called Swish.RDF.Graph, the Lit\n  constructor of the RDFLabel has been split
  into three (Lit, LangLit,\n  and TypedLit) and a new LanguageTag type introduced,
  local names now\n  use the LName type (previously they were just Text values), and
  the\n  parsers and formatters have renamed to Swish.RDF.Parser.* and\n  Swish.RDF.Formatter.*.\n\n
  \ - Moved a number of modules around: generic code directly into Swish\n    and
  the Swish.RDF.RDF* forms renamed to Swish.RDF.*. Some modules\n    have been moved
  out of the Swish.Utils.* namespace. Generic modules\n    have been placed into the
  Data.* namespace. The Swish.RDF.Swish\n    modules have been moved to Swish.* and
  Swish.RDF.SwishMain has\n    been removed; use Swish instead.\n\n  - Parsing modules
  are now in the Swish.RDF.Parser hierarchy and\n    Swish.RDF.RDFParser has been
  renamed to Swish.RDF.Parser.Utils.\n\n  - Formatting modules are now in the Swish.RDF.Formatter
  hierarchy.\n\n  - RDF literals are now stored using the Lit, LangLit, or TypedLit\n
  \   constructors (from RDFLabel) rather than using just Lit. Language\n    codes
  are now represented by Swish.RDF.Vocabulary.LanguageTag\n    rather than as a ScopedName.\n\n
  \ - Local names are now represented by the Swish.QName.LName type\n    rather than
  as a Text value. A few routines now return a Maybe value\n    rather than error-ing
  out on invalid input.\n\n  - Make use of Data.List.NonEmpty in a few cases.\n\n
  \ - Removed mkTypedLit from Swish.RDF.RDFParser; use\n    Swish.RDF.RDFDatatype.makeDataTypedLiteral
  instead.\n\n  - Removed asubj, apred and aobj from Swish.RDF.GraphClass and\n    Swish.RDF.RDFGraph;
  use arcSubj, arcPred or arcObj instead.\n    \n  - Clarified that Swish.RDF.RDFDatatypeXsdDecimal
  is for xsd:decimal\n    rather than xsd:double.\n\n  - Removed the containedIn element
  of the LDGraph type class as it\n    was un-used. The arguments to setArcs have
  been flipped,\n    replaceArcs removed, add renamed to addGraphs, and emptyGraph\n
  \   added.\n\n  - Removed various exported symbols from a range of modules as they
  were\n    un-used.\n\n  - Use Word32 rather than Int for label indexes\n    (Swish.GraphMatch.LabelIndex)
  and in the bnode counts when formatting\n    to N3/Turtle.\n\n  - Minor clean up
  of the LookupMap module: mergeReplaceOrAdd and mergeReplace\n    are now combined
  into mergeReplace; mapSelect, mapApplytoAll, and\n    mapTranslate* have been removed;
  documentation slightly improved; and a\n    few minor internal clean ups.\n\n  -
  Removed the Swish.Utils.MiscHelpers module and moved single-use\n    functionality
  out of Swish.Utils.ListHelpers.\n\n  - Removed partCompareOrd, partCompareMaybe,
  partCompareListOrd and \n    partCompareListPartOrd from Swish.Utils.PartOrderedCollection.\n\n
  \ - Do not define swap if using GHC >= 7.0.1.\n\n  - Bump the upper constraint on
  the containers package to include\n    version 0.5.\n\n  - Support version 0.9 of
  intern using conditional compilation in\n    Data.Interned.URI (for ghc 7.4)\n\n
  \ - Switch to Control.Exception.try from System.IO.Error.try to avoid\n    complaints
  from ghc 7.4.2\n\n0.6.5.3:\n\n  - Updated cabal file so that tests depend on the
  library rather\n    than individual modules.\n\n  - fix intern to 0.8 for ghc <
  7.4 and 0.8.* for greater\n\n0.6.5.2:\n\n  - Upgrade polyparse upper limit to include
  version 1.8.\n\n0.6.5.1:\n\n  - Haddock fixes.\n\n0.6.5.0:\n\n  - Dependency updates
  (updated filepath and removed array).\n\n0.6.4.0:\n\n  - Added support for xsd:decimal
  with Swish.RDF.RDFDatatypeXsdDecimal\n    and Swish.RDF.MapXsdDecimal thanks to
  William Waites\n    (<https://bitbucket.org/ww>).\n\n0.6.3.0:\n\n  - Added Swish.RDF.Vocabulary.SIOC.\n\n0.6.2.1:\n\n
  \ - hackage build fixes only\n\n0.6.2.0:\n\n  - Split out vocabularies into Swish.RDF.Vocabulary.DublinCore,\n
  \   Swish.RDF.Vocabulary.FOAF, Swish.RDF.Vocabulary.Geo,\n    Swish.RDF.Vocabulary.OWL,
  Swish.RDF.Vocabulary.RDF, and\n    Swish.RDF.Vocabulary.XSD (some of these are new
  and additional\n    terms added to the pre-existing vocabularies). A few have also\n
  \   been added to Swish.RDF.RDFGraph.\n\n  - Minimum Cabal version has been updated
  to 1.9.2 as the tests have\n    been converted to take advantage of the support
  now in Cabal; this\n    means that the tests flag has been replaced by the --enable-tests\n
  \   option.\n\n  - Change to the internal labelling of the RDFS container-property\n
  \   axioms in Swish.RDF.RDFProofContext.\n\n  - Moved src/ to app/, and took advantage
  of the emptiness to move\n    the library code into src/.\n\n0.6.1.2:\n\n  - corrected
  mtl constraint from >= 1 to >= 2 as the code does not\n    build with mtl=1 and
  increased the upper limit on time to 1.4.\n\n0.6.1.1:\n\n  - minor improvements
  to error message when parsing Turtle, N3 or\n    Ntriples format; a fragment of
  the remaining text to be parsed is\n    included to provide some context for the
  user (it is still not as\n    useful as the error message provided when parsec was
  being used).\n\n0.6.1.0:\n\n  - add support for reading and writing Turtle format
  and the\n    Swish.RDF.TurtleFormatter and Swish.RDF.TurtleParser modules.  No\n
  \   tests are provided at this time, although the parser handles most\n    of the
  W3C test files; the issues include Network.URI not\n    recognizing some IRI's and
  issues with equating XSD decimal and\n    double values due to canonicalization.\n\n0.6.0.1:\n\n
  \ - use the hashing interface provided by Data.Hashable rather than\n    Swish.Utils.MiscHelpers.\n\n0.6.0.0:\n\n
  \ - use the intern package to create Data.Interned.URI and use\n    this within
  QName to speed up the equality check.\n\n0.5.0.3:\n\n  - Missed a FlexibleInstances
  pragma for ghc 7.2.\n\n0.5.0.2:\n\n  - Removed random and bytesttring package constraints
  and moved HUnit\n    constraint to only apply if the tests flag is used. Added\n
  \   FlexibleInstances pragma for ghc 7.2 compatability.\n\n0.5.0.1:\n\n  - updated
  package constraints in cabal file to try and support\n    building with ghc 7.2.
  No code change.\n\n0.5.0.0:\n\n  - The constructors for ScopedName and QName have
  been removed in\n    order to allow a simple experimental optimisation (partly added
  in\n    0.4.0.0). A similar change has been added for Namespace (but no\n    optimisation).\n\n0.4.0.0:\n\n
  \ - Use polyparse rather than parsec-2 for parsing. As part of this,\n    the parsing
  is done using Text rather than String values, where\n    sensible.  Some parsing
  should be faster now, but that is more due\n    to a better use of parser combinators
  than differences in the\n    parsing library used. No serious attempt at optimisation
  has been\n    attempted.\n\n    Unfortunately the error messages created on invalid
  input are\n    significantly less helpfull than in the previous version.\n\n  -
  removed Swish.Utils.DateTime and Swish.Utils.TraceHelpers\n\n  - removed the following
  exported symbols from Swish.Utils.LookupMap:\n        mapSortByKey, mapSortByVal\n\n
  \ - removed the following exported symbols from Swish.Utils.ListHelpers:\n        allf,
  anyf, combinations, ffold, hasPartitions,\n        mapset, pairsUngroup, powerSequences,
  powerSequences_inf\n\n  - removed the following exported symbols from Swish.Utils.MiscHelpers:\n
  \       assert, stricmp, lower, quote\n\n  - removed _ from exported symbols; the
  conversion is mainly to camel\n    case but some may retain lower case parts (e.g.
  xxx_1_1_inv to\n    xxx11inv).\n\n  - Namespace now uses Maybe Text to store the
  optional prefix rather\n    than an ad-hoc \"\"/\"?\" solution and URI rather than
  String for the\n    URI.  The local part of ScopedName is now Text.  QName also
  uses\n    URIs and no longer exports the constructor so newQName or related\n    should
  be used to create QNames.\n\n    We have currently lost N3 formatting of the default
  prefix (any\n    default prefix elements end up getting written out fully\n    qualified).
  The output is still valid N3 but perhaps not what\n    you'd expect.\n\n0.3.2.1:\n\n
  \ - use foldl' rather than foldl in some modules\n\n  - Swish.Utils.*:\n\n    -
  marked routines as deprecated\n\n0.3.2.0:\n\n  - Swish.RDF.N3Parser:\n\n    - the
  parser no longer has a set of pre-defined namespaces with\n      the aim of reducing
  un-needed statements on output.\n\n  There is no API change worthy of a bump of
  the minor version but\n  the behavioural change is large enough to make it worth
  while.\n\n0.3.1.2:\n\n  - Swish.RDF.RDFGraph:\n\n    - toRDFGraph now uses the supplied
  labels to set up the namespace\n      rather than using an empty namespace map.\n\n
  \   - minor documentation improvements.\n\n0.3.1.1:\n\n  - N3 I/O: \n\n    - strings
  ending in a double-quote character are now written out\n      correctly.\n\n    -
  xsd:double values are not written using XSD canonical\n      form/capital E but
  with using a lower-case exponent.\n\n    - in input, xsd:double literals are converted
  to XSD canonical\n      form (as stored in 'RDFLabel'), which can make simple textual\n
  \     comparison of literals fail.\n\n  - RDFLabel:\n\n    - the Eq instance now
  ignores the case of the language tag for\n      literals\n\n    - the Show instance
  uses the XSD canonical form for xsd:boolean,\n      xsd:integer, xsd:decimal and
  xsd:double literals. \n\n  - The ToRDFLable and FromRDFLabel classes replicate\n
  \   existing functionality in Swish.RDF.RDFDatatype; this should\n    be cleaned
  up.\n\n0.3.1.0:\n\n  - NSGraph:\n\n    - added Monoid instance with a Label constraint.\n\n
  \ - RDFLabel:\n\n    - added IsString instance.\n\n    - added ToRDFLabel and FromRDFLabel
  type classes for converting to\n      and from RDFLabel along with instances for
  some standard Haskell\n      types.\n\n  - RDFTriple:\n\n    - added toRDFTriple
  and fromRDFTriple functions that take advantage\n      of the To/FromRDFLabel typeclasses
  to ease conversion from/to Arcs.\n\n  - QName and ScopedName:\n\n    - added IsString
  instance.\n\n  - UTCTime support (To/FromRDFLabel) has required adding old-locale\n
  \   and time to the package constraints.\n\n  - added xsd_dateTime export to Swish.RDF.Vocabulary.\n\n
  \ - added Swish and Swish.RDF modules for documentation purposes.\n\n  - marked
  Swish.Utils.DateTime as deprecated.\n\n  - the N3 formatter now writes true, 1,
  1.2, 1.2e34 rather than\n    \"true\"^^xsd:boolean, \"1\"^^xsd:integer, \"1.2\"^^xsd:decimal\n
  \   and \"1.2e34\"^^xsd:double.\n\n  - improved test coverage.\n\n0.3.0.3:\n\n  -
  changed scripts/SwishExample.ss script so that the proof succeeds.\n\n  - minor
  documentation improvements, including the addition of the\n    Swish script format
  in Swish.RDF.SwishScript.\n\n  - minor changes to behavior of Swish in several edge
  cases.\n\n0.3.0.2:\n\n  - bugfix: stop losing triples with a bnode subject when
  using the\n    N3 Formatter which also makes the scripts/SwishTest.ss script run\n
  \   successfully.\n\n  - several commands in Swish scripts now create screen\n    output
  as an aid to debugging.\n\n  - added the developer flag.\n\n0.3.0.1:\n\n  - updated
  the Swish script parser to work with the changes in\n    0.3.0.0 (reported by Rick
  Murphy).\n\n  - several example scripts are installed in the scripts/ directory,\n
  \   although only VehicleCapacity.ss works with this release.\n\n0.2.1 to 0.3.0.0:\n\n
  \ - Renamed module hierarchy from\n\n      Swish.HaskellRDF.*\n      Swish.HaskellUtils.*\n\n
  \   to\n\n      Swish.RDF.*\n      Swish.Utils.*\n\n  - removed modules, either

  from Network.URI\n\n      Swish.HaskellRDF.ProcessURI\n      Swish.HaskellRDF.ParseURI\n\n
  \   *) copy of a Parsec module\n\n      Swish.HaskellRDF.ParsecLanguage\n\n    *)
  Replaced with Data.List.sort as only used the \n       stableQuickSort routine\n\n
  \     Swish.HaskellRDF.Sort.*\n\n    *) Replaced use with simple parsec parser\n\n
  \     Swish.HaskellRDF.Dfa.Dfa\n\n    *) Replaced with 'Either String'\n\n      Swish.HaskellUtils.ErrorM\n\n

  \     Swish.HaskellUtils.TestHelpers\n\n  - removed Either String instance from
  ErrorM\n\n  - should now compile with mtl-2\n\n  - added upper and lower bounds
  to package dependencies\n\n  - a number of Test executables have been removed, either\n
  \   because of a removed module or missing data files.\n\n  - updated Haddock documentation
  to build\n\n  - added the following flags\n\n      tests   - compile tests or not?\n
  \     hpc     - compile tests with -hpc?\n\n  - support for the NTriples format
  has been added (e.g. the -nt\n    flag in Swish)\n\n  - the N3 parser and formatter
  have been re-written to better\n    match the latest specification. Some previously

description: "\n# Introduction\n\nSwish - which stands for Semantic Web Inference
  Scripting in Haskell -\nwas written by Graham Klyne as a framework, written in the
  purely\nfunctional programming language Haskell, for performing deductions in\nRDF
  data using a variety of techniques. Swish was conceived as a\ntoolkit for experimenting
  with RDF inference, and for implementing\nstand-alone RDF file processors (usable
  in similar style to CWM, but\nwith a view to being extensible in declarative style
  through added\nHaskell function and data value declarations). One of the aims was
  to\nexplore Haskell as \"[a scripting language for the Semantic\nWeb](http://www.ninebynine.org/RDFNotes/Swish/Intro.html)\".\n\nIt
  was updated from version 0.2.1 by Vasili I Galchin so that it would\nbuild with
  the current version of GHC, and\n[released on Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/swish-0.2.1).\n\nSince
  then it has been updated to take advantage of recent\ndevelopments in the Haskell
  ecosystem, add support for the NTriples\nand Turtle serialisation formats, and a
  number of convenience\nfunctions. Development is done on the [bitbucket\nsite](https://bitbucket.org/doug_burke/swish/);
  there is an *outdated*\nversion [on GitHub](https://github.com/DougBurke/swish),
  which was\nbeing used for its access to Travis.\n\nI attempt to keep Swish buildable
  on recent GHC versions - at present\nback to GHC 7.4 although not actually tested
  on such - but it is done\non a best-effort basis, so is not guaranteed.\n\n# Aim\n\nCurrent
  development is based on my own needs, which are more about\nusing this as a RDF
  library for I/O with limited querying rather than\nfor inferencing or use as a flexible
  graph-processing library\n(e.g. for extensions to non-RDF models).\n\n# Copyright\n\n

  and then try\n\n    % cabal update\n    % cabal install swish\n\n## With stack\n\nSwish
  is available as part of the stackage curated package set.\n\nThere are several stack
  configuration files, for different GHC\nversions:\n\n    % cd swish\n    % stack
