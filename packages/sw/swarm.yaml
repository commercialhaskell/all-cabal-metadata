  \ - This bug caused the game to always report that there was a new\n    version
  available even when you already had the latest (and only!) version.\n\n## **0.1.0.0**
  - 2022-10-06\n\nFirst Swarm release! Swarm already has:\n\n- a programming language
  based on the polymorphic\n  lambda calculus + recursion, with a command monad for
  describing\n  first-class imperative actions\n- scenarios which can be loaded from
  YAML files\n  - the release comes with official challenges and an in-game tutorial\n
  \ - the default Classic and Creative modes use the same YAML syntax\n  - we include
  JSON schemas for editor support when writing scenarios \n- procedural 2D world generation\n-
  LSP server built into the Swarm executable\n- Terminal UI interface\n  - running
  the executable opens the Main menu by default\n  - game screen with a world view,
  inventory and REPL\n    - popup windows for messages, challenge descriptions, etc.\n"

description: |-
  Swarm is a 2D programming and resource gathering
  game. Program your robots to explore the world and
  collect resources, which in turn allows you to
  build upgraded robots that can run more
  interesting and complex programs. See the
  <https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/blob/main/README.md README>
  for more information and instructions on how to
  play or contribute!

  == Module organization
  For developers getting oriented, Swarm's modules are organized into
  roughly the following layers, from inner to outer:

  * utilities
  * swarm language
  * swarm game
  * swarm TUI
  * swarm app

  To maintain this separation, inner layers should avoid introducing
  dependencies on layers above them.
