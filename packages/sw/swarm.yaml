changelog: "# Revision history for swarm\n\n## **0.2.0.0** - 2022-11-01\n\nA bunch
  of small fixes and improvements; special thanks to new\ncontributors @0xcefaedfe,

  \   - REPL improvements:\n        - Expose the last evaluated result as `it`, and
  previous results\n          as `itN` ([#734](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/734))\n
  \       - Allow clicking in the REPL input to move the cursor\n          ([#750](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/750))\n
  \       - Autocomplete entity names in the repl ([#798](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/798))\n
  \       - REPL cursor no longer blinks when REPL panel is not selected ([#801](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/801))\n
  \   - Improve user experience around quitting & moving between\n      tutorial challenges
  ([#754](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/754))\n        - Add a button to
  the Quit dialog to restart a\n          scenario. ([#767](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/767))\n
  \       - Use scenario name as Goal dialog title ([#774](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/774))\n
  \   - `autoplay` flag for automatically demonstrating scenario\n      solutions
  ([#792](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/792))\n    - Improved inventory
  sorting and user-controllable sort criteria ([#793](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/793))\n
  \   - Ability to temporarily hide robots so you can see what's under\n      them
  ([#802](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/802))\n- New language features:\n
  \   - New `void` type ([#735](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/735))\n-
  Bug fixes:\n    - Fix bug in the first tutorial challenge that froze the game and\n
  \     ate all memory if the user said anything other than expected\n      ([#762](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/762),
  [#810](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/810))\n- Documentation:\n    - Generate
  all wiki \"cheat sheets\" automatically ([#769](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/769))\n-
  Support for building on GHC 9.4 ([#752](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/752))\n\nThere
  were several other small fixes and improvements; see the [full\nchangelog\nhere](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/compare/0.1.1.0...0.2.0.0).\n\n##
  **0.1.1.0** - 2022-10-14\n\nA couple new features and an important bugfix for the
  Hackage release.\n\n- Update to `hsnoise-0.0.3`, fixing some world generation bugs
  that\n  only showed up in the Hackage\n  release. ([#746](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/746))\n-
  New \"blank\" creative scenario\n  ([#741](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/741))\n-
  REPL improvements\n    - `Ctrl-D` at an empty REPL prompt now triggers a quit\n
  \     ([#743](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/743))\n    - The REPL panel
  now persists in showing the type of the most\n      recently evaluated expression
  ([#733](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/733))\n\n## **0.1.0.1** - 2022-10-06\n\nA
  bugfix release for a few minor bugs that plagued the first release:\n\n- Fall back
  to to the swarm data directory when a `run` file is not\n  found ([#730](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/730))\n
  \ - This bug caused the move tutorial to be unplayable because it tried to execute\n
  \   `run \"data/scenarios/Tutorials/move_system.sw\"`\n- Fix version check when
  there is no GitInfo\n  ([#729](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/729))\n
  \ - This bug caused the game to always report that there was a new\n    version
  available even when you already had the latest (and only!) version.\n\n## **0.1.0.0**
  - 2022-10-06\n\nFirst Swarm release! Swarm already has:\n\n- a programming language
  based on the polymorphic\n  lambda calculus + recursion, with a command monad for
  describing\n  first-class imperative actions\n- scenarios which can be loaded from
  YAML files\n  - the release comes with official challenges and an in-game tutorial\n
  \ - the default Classic and Creative modes use the same YAML syntax\n  - we include
  JSON schemas for editor support when writing scenarios \n- procedural 2D world generation\n-
  LSP server built into the Swarm executable\n- Terminal UI interface\n  - running
  the executable opens the Main menu by default\n  - game screen with a world view,
  inventory and REPL\n    - popup windows for messages, challenge descriptions, etc.\n"
