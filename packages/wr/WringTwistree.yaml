description: "# WringTwistree\nWring is a whole-message cipher. This is like a block
  cipher, but the block can be arbitrarily large, up to about 3 GiB (the Rust version
  will start getting multiplication overflows about there). Wring can also be used
  as a length-preserving all-or-nothing transform.\n\nTwistree is a hash function.
  It constructs two trees out of the blocks of data, runs the compression function
  at each node of the trees, and combines the results with the compression function.\n\nBoth
  algorithms are keyed. The key is turned into 96 16-bit words, which are then used
  to make three S-boxes. The key can be any byte string, including the empty string.\n\n#
  Features\nA round consists of four operations:\n\n1. The `mix3Parts` operation splits
  the message or block in three equal parts and mixes them nonlinearly. This provides
  both diffusion and nonlinearity. The number of rounds in Wring increases logarithmically
  with message size so that diffusion spreads to the entire message.\n2. The three
  key-dependent 8×8 S-boxes provide confusion and \nresist linear cryptanalysis.\n3.
  Rotating by the population count thwarts integral and differential cryptanalysis
  by moving the difference around to a different part of the message.\n4. Wring's
  round constant, which is dependent on the byte position as well as the round number,
  is added to every byte to prevent slide attacks and ensure that an all-zero message
  doesn't stay that way.\n4. Twistree runs a CRC backwards to make the four bytes
  about to be dropped affect all the other bytes.\n\n# Rust\nTo run the program, type
  `cargo run`. The first time you run it, Cargo may download a quarter-gigabyte of
  data, which is the index to all crates. You can also test the program with `cargo
  test`.\n\n# Haskell\nYou can run WringTwistree in the REPL with `stack ghci`, compile
  and run it with `stack run`, or use other Stack commands. You can also test the
  program with `stack test`.\n\n# Command-line options\n`stack run -- -k key -e plaintext
  -o ciphertext` enciphers a file. Omit `-o ciphertext` to encipher in place.\n\n`stack
  run -- -k key -d ciphertext -o plaintext` deciphers a file. Omit `-o plaintext`
  to decipher in place.\n\n`stack run -- -k key -H plaintext -o hash` hashes a file.
  Omit `-o hash` to output the hash to stdout.\n\n`stack run -- -c foo` runs cryptanalysis
  of type `foo`, which is currently `relkey` for related-key cryptanalysis. This option
  is not available in the Rust implementation.\n\n`cargo` instead of `stack` runs
  the Rust implementation; the options are the same, except that hash is `-h`.\n\nThe
  Rust binary is `wring-twistree` and can be installed with `cargo install --path
  .`; the Haskell binary is `WringTwistree` and can be installed with `stack install`.
  They take the options after `--`.\n\n# Test vectors\nTest vectors are in `test/Spec.hs`
  and `src/lib.rs`.\n"
