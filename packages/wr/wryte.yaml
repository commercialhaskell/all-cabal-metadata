  # wryte

  Pretty-printed source code with semi-automatic indentation

  ## Introduction

  Wryte provides an API for generating textual source code with pretty
  indentation and alignment. To achieve this, it tracks source column position,
  newlines, and current indentation / alignment internally, and provides a
  monadic API to conveniently manage these.

  ## Installation

  The usual; `cabal install wryte`, or add wryte to your stack
  extra-dependencies.

  ## Basic Usage


  ```haskell
  putStrLn . runWryte_ defWryteOptions $ do
    wryteLn "module Main where"
    wryteLn ""
    wryteLn "main = do"
    indented $ do
      wryteLn "putStrLn \"Hello, world!\"
  ```

  Indentation is tracked monadically, such that `indented` acts as a wrapper that
  automatically prepends indentation to each new line. Indentations stack up, so
  you can safely nest them, and they will do the right thing.
