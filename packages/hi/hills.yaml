  hills
  =====

  A program to generate 3D models of places on the Earth's surface.

  It uses as input the SRTM 90m elevation data from CGIAR-CSI, which is
  downloadable free of charge from <http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org>.  It
  outputs binary STL.

  In spite of its name the program also works on valleys.

  -- David Fletcher <david@bubblycloud.com>


  Basic use
  ---------

  Pick a latitude and longitude. (Google Maps will show it when you
  click on a point.)

  Run hills.  It won't work because we don't have the input data yet,
  but it will tell us which tiles we need.

      hills --position 56.64,-4.91 out.stl

  Obtain the input data tiles from CGIAR-CSI
  <http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/SELECTION/inputCoord.asp> or a mirror.

  You want the ArcInfo ASCII format.  The download interface on the
  website is painful so you may find it easier just to construct a
  direct URL.

      wget http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/SRT-ZIP/SRTM_v41/SRTM_Data_ArcASCII/srtm_36_01.zip

  Unzip the downloaded file and you should obtain a file named
  srtm_36_01.asc.

  Run hills to generate a model.

      hills --position 56.64,-4.91 out.stl

  Look at the output in your favourite STL viewer.


  Options
  -------

      --position LAT,LONG
      -p LAT,LONG

  Latitude and longitude as decimals.  North of the equator is positive,
  south is negative. East from Greenwich is positive, west is negative.

  Usually the centre of the area to be modelled (but see --offset).

      --dimensions ARCSECxARCSEC
      -d ARCSECxARCSEC

  Size of the area to model in arcseconds, latitude first.  Defaults to
  300x600.

  Remember as you go further north or south from the equator, arcseconds
  of longitude get smaller.

      --base-altitude METRES
      -b METRES

  The bottom of the volume to be modelled.  Defaults to 0m (sea level).
  If you are modelling land on a plateau or massif you may want to set
  this higher so that your model won't be on such a thick base.  If you
  are modelling land that goes below sea level you'll need to use a
  negative value to put the base low enough.

      --scale FACTOR
      -s FACTOR

  Defaults to 100, meaning 1:100.  This might seem like a larger scale
  than anyone would want, but note that the program outputs in metres
  whereas 3D printers commonly expect millimetres, so you might already
  be getting a factor of 1000 on top of what you specify here.

      --input-dir DIR
      -i DIR

  If you have your .asc files somewhere other than the current
  directory, point to them with this option.

      --offset ARCSECxARCSEC
      -o ARCSECxARCSEC

  In arcseconds, latitude first.  Offset from the specified position to
  the southwest corner of the area.  By default the position is the
  centre of the area.  So if you'd rather specify the southwest corner
  you can use an offset of 0x0.

  However, the main reason for this option is to generate multi-part
  models without having to change the reference position.  This is
  convenient because the dimensions are in arcseconds so it's easier to
  do your local positioning in arcseconds too.  It's also more accurate,
  because the program calculates the number of metres per arcsecond at
  the specified position, and if you change the position between two of
  the parts their scales may not match perfectly.


  Caveats and bugs
  ----------------

  - The SRTM data doesn't go north or south of 60 degrees, so this
    program can't help you in those areas.

  - The program doesn't yet do any interpolation between the input
    samples.  So the position you supply is rounded to the nearest input
    sample position, and dimensions that are not multiples of three
    arcseconds are expanded so that the edges are on 3-arcsecond
    boundaries.  If you care about the exact size of the model or you
    are making a multi-part model, it is best to use offsets and
    dimensions which are multiples of three.

  - Areas straddling the line 180 degrees east/west probably won't work.
    If you want to model an area where this matters (perhaps in Fiji or
    the Aleutians) let me know and I'll fix it.


  Examples
  --------

  ### Ben Nevis

  This crosses a tile boundary - needs both srtm_35_01.asc and
  srtm_36_01.asc.

      hills -p 56.812,-4.99 ben-nevis.stl


  ### Mont Blanc

  Needs srtm_30_03.asc.  We use a size of 500x1000 arcseconds and a base
  altitude of 500m.

      hills -p 45.8334,6.8650 -d 500x1000 -b 500 mont-blanc.stl


  ### Part of the Grand Canyon

      hills -p 36.13,-111.93 -d 1200x1500 -b 200 grand-canyon.stl


  ### Mount Kilimanjaro

  Needs srtm_44_13.asc.

      hills -p -3.076,37.35 -d 1500x1500 -b 600 kilimanjaro.stl


  ### Ochil hills

  A 1:50000 scale model covering an area about 26km x 13km, in eight
  parts each about 13cm x 13cm.

      hills -p 56.145,-3.96 -s 50 -d 210x375 --offset 0,0 ochils-a0.stl
      hills -p 56.145,-3.96 -s 50 -d 210x375 --offset 0,375 ochils-a1.stl
      hills -p 56.145,-3.96 -s 50 -d 210x375 --offset 0,750 ochils-a2.stl
      hills -p 56.145,-3.96 -s 50 -d 210x375 --offset 0,1125 ochils-a3.stl
      hills -p 56.145,-3.96 -s 50 -d 210x375 --offset 210,0 ochils-b0.stl
      hills -p 56.145,-3.96 -s 50 -d 210x375 --offset 210,375 ochils-b1.stl
      hills -p 56.145,-3.96 -s 50 -d 210x375 --offset 210,750 ochils-b2.stl
      hills -p 56.145,-3.96 -s 50 -d 210x375 --offset 210,1125 ochils-b3.stl

  The parts are laid out like this:
