description: ! "hills\n=====\n\nA program to generate 3D models of places on the Earth's
  surface.\n\nIt uses as input the SRTM 90m elevation data from CGIAR-CSI, which is\ndownloadable
  free of charge from <http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org>.  It\noutputs binary STL.\n\nIn
  spite of its name the program also works on valleys.\n\n-- David Fletcher <david@bubblycloud.com>\n\n\nBasic
  use\n---------\n\nPick a latitude and longitude. (Google Maps will show it when
  you\nclick on a point.)\n\nRun hills.  It won't work because we don't have the input
  data yet,\nbut it will tell us which tiles we need.\n\n    hills --position 56.64,-4.91
  out.stl\n\nObtain the input data tiles from CGIAR-CSI\n<http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/SELECTION/inputCoord.asp>
  or a mirror.\n\nYou want the ArcInfo ASCII format.  The download interface on the\nwebsite
  is painful so you may find it easier just to construct a\ndirect URL.\n\n    wget
  http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/SRT-ZIP/SRTM_v41/SRTM_Data_ArcASCII/srtm_36_01.zip\n\nUnzip
  the downloaded file and you should obtain a file named\nsrtm_36_01.asc.\n\nRun hills
  to generate a model.\n\n    hills --position 56.64,-4.91 out.stl\n\nLook at the
  output in your favourite STL viewer.\n\n\nOptions\n-------\n\n    --position LAT,LONG\n
  \   -p LAT,LONG\n\nLatitude and longitude as decimals.  North of the equator is
  positive,\nsouth is negative. East from Greenwich is positive, west is negative.\n\nUsually
  the centre of the area to be modelled (but see --offset).\n\n    --dimensions ARCSECxARCSEC\n
  \   -d ARCSECxARCSEC\n\nSize of the area to model in arcseconds, latitude first.
  \ Defaults to\n300x600.\n\nRemember as you go further north or south from the equator,
  arcseconds\nof longitude get smaller.\n\n    --base-altitude METRES\n    -b METRES\n\nThe
  bottom of the volume to be modelled.  Defaults to 0m (sea level).\nIf you are modelling
  land on a plateau or massif you may want to set\nthis higher so that your model
  won't be on such a thick base.  If you\nare modelling land that goes below sea level
  you'll need to use a\nnegative value to put the base low enough.\n\n    --scale
  FACTOR\n    -s FACTOR\n\nDefaults to 100, meaning 1:100.  This might seem like a
  larger scale\nthan anyone would want, but note that the program outputs in metres\nwhereas
  3D printers commonly expect millimetres, so you might already\nbe getting a factor
  of 1000 on top of what you specify here.\n\n    --input-dir DIR\n    -i DIR\n\nIf
  you have your .asc files somewhere other than the current\ndirectory, point to them
  with this option.\n\n    --offset ARCSECxARCSEC\n    -o ARCSECxARCSEC\n\nIn arcseconds,
  latitude first.  Offset from the specified position to\nthe southwest corner of
  the area.  By default the position is the\ncentre of the area.  So if you'd rather
  specify the southwest corner\nyou can use an offset of 0x0.\n\nHowever, the main
  reason for this option is to generate multi-part\nmodels without having to change
  the reference position.  This is\nconvenient because the dimensions are in arcseconds
  so it's easier to\ndo your local positioning in arcseconds too.  It's also more
  accurate,\nbecause the program calculates the number of metres per arcsecond at\nthe
  specified position, and if you change the position between two of\nthe parts their
  scales may not match perfectly.\n\n\nCaveats and bugs\n----------------\n\n- The
  SRTM data doesn't go north or south of 60 degrees, so this\n  program can't help
  you in those areas.\n\n- The program doesn't yet do any interpolation between the
  input\n  samples.  So the position you supply is rounded to the nearest input\n
  \ sample position, and dimensions that are not multiples of three\n  arcseconds
  are expanded so that the edges are on 3-arcsecond\n  boundaries.  If you care about
  the exact size of the model or you\n  are making a multi-part model, it is best
  to use offsets and\n  dimensions which are multiples of three.\n\n- Areas straddling
  the line 180 degrees east/west probably won't work.\n  If you want to model an area
  where this matters (perhaps in Fiji or\n  the Aleutians) let me know and I'll fix
  it.\n\n\nExamples\n--------\n\n### Ben Nevis\n\nThis crosses a tile boundary - needs
  both srtm_35_01.asc and\nsrtm_36_01.asc.\n\n    hills -p 56.812,-4.99 ben-nevis.stl\n\n\n###
  Mont Blanc\n\nNeeds srtm_30_03.asc.  We use a size of 500x1000 arcseconds and a
  base\naltitude of 500m.\n\n    hills -p 45.8334,6.8650 -d 500x1000 -b 500 mont-blanc.stl\n\n\n###
  Part of the Grand Canyon\n\n    hills -p 36.13,-111.93 -d 1200x1500 -b 200 grand-canyon.stl\n\n\n###
  Mount Kilimanjaro\n\nNeeds srtm_44_13.asc.\n\n    hills -p -3.076,37.35 -d 1500x1500
  -b 600 kilimanjaro.stl\n\n\n### Ochil hills\n\nA 1:50000 scale model covering an
  area about 26km x 13km, in eight\nparts each about 13cm x 13cm.\n\n    hills -p
