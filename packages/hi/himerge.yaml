changelog: "Himerge -- Haskell Interface for Emerge\n\n-- version 0.20 (May, 01, 2008)\n\n
  \  1 - The queue operation 'add' is now available through a right-click from\n   the
  browser version view for each package.\n   2 - The queue operations 'remove/clear'
  are now available from each of the\n   control panel package queue through a right-click.\n
  \  3 - A backup of all the system files used by himerge will be created inside\n
  \  the ~/.himerge/ directory.\n   4 - The USE flag browser is highly-improved. A
  new browser constrcution\n   mechanism speeds up the launch of the browser and shows
  a more organized and\n   coherent framework, listing only the necessary flags boxes
  available for a\n   given entity (a package or the whole system use flags).\n\n--
  version 0.18 (Apr, 01, 2008)\n\n   1 - USE flag browser improved. It now shows use
  flags classified\n   alphabetically on independent panels.\n   2 - Himerge now correctly
  handles the reload procedure of portage during\n   the installation of packages.\n
  \  3 - The tree views interface is slightly improved. Now the views are\n   updated
  when pressing 'Enter' on each row too.\n   4 - Some code refactored.\n\n-- version
  0.17.9 (Mar, 04, 2008)\n\n   1 - The use flags browser has been improved to correctly
  parse certain use\n   flags.\n   2 - Himerge is now hackage compliant.\n\n-- version
  0.17.3 (Feb, 23, 2008)\n\n   1 - Run update-eix after each Sync and Metadata updating
  operation, so the\n   package database is automatically updated for the browser
  views and search\n   functions.\n   2 - Now the web package information window is
  updated on selecting packages\n   from the different package queues and the package
  versions view.\n   3 - A few functions have been refactored for reducing complexity
  of code.\n   4 - A slight bug on showing a package action operation in the package
  queues \n   has been fixed.\n\n-- version 0.17 (Feb, 9, 2008)\n\n   1 - Allow full
  view of the control panel.\n   2 - Added support to show the action type to be processed
  for each package\n   inside the 'Queue' windows.\n   3 - Fixed an important bug
  on the UseFlag browser.\n   4 - Slightly improved some processes speed.\n   5 -
  Cabal file improved so it can use the sdist cabal option for packaging.\n\n-- version
  0.16.1 (Jan, 15, 2008)\n\n   1 - Fixed an important bug that stopped saving the
  panel pages.\n\n-- version 0.16 (Jan, 14, 2008)\n\n   1 - GHC 6.8 complaint.\n   2
  - Added the 'Portage Browser Operations' panel.\n   3 - Added the 'Browser Editor'
  panel for editing the contents shown by the\n   browser in a given time. This helps
  dealing with special cases like for\n   example, accessing removed packages information
  from the portage tree.\n   4 - Added the option to 'Refresh' the browser views.\n
  \  5 - Interactive searching enabled for the packages 'Queue' list. Now\n   packages
  can be easily searched and located interactively from any queue\n   list.\n   6
  - Text buffer operations improved. It avoids gtk+ warning about invalid\n   iterators
  while updating text buffers.\n   7 - Scroll to the current processed package in
  the 'Queue' lists.\n   8 - Avoid the web browser panel to shrink smaller than its
  allowed size.\n   This fixes a gtk+ warning.\n   9 - Now Himerge allows to work
  with the branching operations\n   keyword/mask/unmask over all the versions of a
  package at once.\n   10 - Removed some un-used functions.\n\n-- version 0.15 (Nov,
  3, 2007)\n\n   1 - Multi-Tab support added. This feature allows to show several
  panel\n   pages (package queues, command views) for different processes at the same\n
  \  time.\n   2 - Process handling support improved. Processes can now independently
  be stopped.\n   3 - Log support added. Now himerge will log all (or most of) the
  operations\n   in the new 'Log' panel page.\n   4 - An important bug in the text
  buffers has been fixed.\n   5 - Himerge now asks for confirmation for many essential
  operations.\n   6 - Some code refactoring and small bugs fixes done.\n\n-- version
  0.14.7 (Sep, 29, 2007)\n\n   1 - Package queue status notification added.\n   2
  - USE flag browser layout improved.\n   3 - Package search feature is now more flexible.
  It can match exact package\n   names or it can match all the packages containing
  a specific sub-string.\n   4 - New button added to list all the current packages
  installed in the\n   system. (portage-utils dependency introduced for this feature.)\n
  \  5 - Question dialogs added to confirm installation/un-installation operations.\n
  \  6 - Several slight bugs fixed.\n\n-- version 0.14 (Sep, 07, 2007)\n\n   1 - Tooltips
  added to the buttons's operations.\n   2 - Support for /etc/portage/ directories.
  For example, now you can have\n   package.keywords/ as a directory containing more
  files.\n   3 - Added support for calculating the direct reverse dependencies of
  a\n   package.\n   4 - Now the views will scroll to the cell of a specific package
  when this\n   one is found using the package search feature.\n   5 - Now Himerge
  will automatically move and show the notebook pages\n   when they are initially
  created with an operation.\n   6 - Fixed an important bug that avoided finding the
  first packages in a\n   treeview using the package search option.\n   7 - The synchronization
  speed between the processes output and the current\n   operations have been slightly
  improved.\n   8 - Package search box improved with a dropdown list for search history.\n
  \  9 - Added a new accelerator to show documentation.\n   10 - The USE flag browser
  has been improved to match correct local use\n   flags option for a package.\n   11
  - Fixed an USE flag browser bug that made the browser crashes with output \n   containing
  an empty list.\n   12 - Added the Himerge logo in some part of the application and
  components.\n   13 - Some bugs fixed and slight code refactoring in several functions.\n\n--
  version 0.13 (May, 03, 2007)\n\n   1 - First release.\n\n"
