description: ! 'Chipmunk is a fast, simple, portable, 2D physics engine

  (<http://code.google.com/p/chipmunk-physics/>).  This

  package the Chipmunk 5.3.4 source and Haskell bindings to

  all of its functions. It is completely self-contained.

  Please see <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/HipmunkPlayground>

  for a demonstration of this library.


  Version 5.2.0.16:


  * Bump dependency on transformers. (Thanks, Alfredo Di Napoli!)


  Version 5.2.0.15:


  * Fix for working with GHC 7.6 again.


  Version 5.2.0.14:


  * Compatibility with GHC 7.8. (Thanks, Michael Tolly!)


  Version 5.2.0.11:


  * Compatibility with base == 4.6.* (Thanks, Zack Corr!)


  Version 5.2.0.10:


  * Compatibility with base < 4.4


  New in version 5.2.0.9:


  * Added Physics.Hipmunk.Constraint.setMaxBias and setMaxForce.

  Thanks to Stephen Paul Weber.


  New in version 5.2.0.6:


  * Fixed a memory leak related to collision handlers.


  New in version 5.2.0.5:


  * Always compile @wrapper.c@ and fix Haddock errors

  while handling Unicode.  Thanks, Joachim Breitner.


  New in version 5.2.0.4:


  * New system-chipmunk flag.  When activated, the package will

  use the system-wide installed Chipmunk library.  Thanks,

  Joachim Breitner.


  New in version 5.2.0.3:


  * Update to Chipmunk 5.3.5 and bump dependencies to

  match GHC 7.2.1. (Thanks, S&#246;nke Hahn!)


  * Now S&#246;nke Hahn is also a Hipmunk maintainer.  Awesome!


  New in version 5.2.0.2:


  * Update to Chipmunk 5.3.4.  Note, however, that not all

  functionality available in Chipmunk 5.3.4 is here yet.  But

  the bug fixes and performance improvements are.


  * Fix linking bug present since Hipmunk 5.1.0.  Thanks, S&#246;nke Hahn.


  * Correctly destroy the space in the presence of callbacks.


  * Workaround difficult-to-reproduce bug in Chipmunk where the

  number of contact points in an arbiter would get garbage.

  When that happens (and the garbage does look like garbage) we

  give an empty list of contact points.
