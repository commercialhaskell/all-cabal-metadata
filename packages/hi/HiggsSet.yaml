description: |-
  This package allows you to define several typesafe
  indizes on a set. You can query the set with an SQL-like
  set of query operations.
  This package was developed as a successor of 'Data.IxSet'.
  It is meant to be more space efficient, since it uses
  'Data.IntSet' and 'Data.TrieMap' as an underlying represenation.
  It also has the potential to be fast, since indizes don't
  need to be recalculated after each query and since
  Patricia trees perform quite well for intersection and union.
  This package comes without warranties. Although I use it
  without problems in a large web project it is neither properly
  tested nor benchmarked.
  Patches or suggestions for improvement are welcome. If you like,
  start an issue on github.
