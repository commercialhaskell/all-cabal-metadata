  Haskell pretty printer

  [Examples](https://github.com/mihaimaruseac/hindent/blob/master/TESTS.md)

  ## Install

      $ stack install hindent

  ## Usage

      $ hindent --help
      hindent - Reformat Haskell source code

      Usage: hindent [--version | [--line-length ARG]
                       [--indent-size ARG | --tab-size ARG] [--no-force-newline]
                       [--sort-imports | --no-sort-imports] [--style STYLE]
                       [-X GHCEXT] [--validate] [FILENAMES]]

      Available options:
        --version                Print the version
        --line-length ARG        Desired length of lines (default: 80)
        --indent-size ARG        Indentation size in spaces (default: 2)
        --tab-size ARG           Same as --indent-size, for compatibility
        --no-force-newline       Don't force a trailing newline
        --sort-imports           Sort imports in groups
        --no-sort-imports        Don't sort imports
        --style STYLE            Style to print with (historical, now ignored)
        -X GHCEXT                Language extension
        --validate               Check if files are formatted without changing them
        -h,--help                Show this help text

  hindent is used in a pipeline style

      $ cat path/to/sourcefile.hs | hindent

  The default indentation size is `2` spaces. Configure indentation size with `--indent-size`:

      $ echo 'example = case x of Just p -> foo bar' | hindent --indent-size 2; echo
      example =
        case x of
          Just p -> foo bar
      $ echo 'example = case x of Just p -> foo bar' | hindent --indent-size 4; echo
      example =
          case x of
              Just p -> foo bar

  ## Customization

  Create a `.hindent.yaml` file in your project directory or in your
  `~/` home directory. The following fields are accepted and are the
  default:

  ``` yaml
  indent-size: 2
  line-length: 80
  force-trailing-newline: true
  sort-imports: true
  line-breaks: []
  extensions: []
  ```

  By default, hindent preserves the newline or lack of newline in your input. With `force-trailing-newline`, it will make sure there is always a trailing newline.

  hindent can be forced to insert a newline before specific operators and tokens with `line-breaks`. This is especially useful when utilizing libraries like [`servant`](https://docs.servant.dev/) which use long type aliases.

  Using `extensions`, hindent can be made aware of valid syntactic compiler extensions that would normally be considered invalid syntax.

  It is also possible to specify which extensions HIndent runs
  with in your `.hindent.yaml`:

  ```yaml
  extensions:
    - MagicHash
    - RecursiveDo
  ```

  ## Emacs

  In
  [elisp/hindent.el](https://github.com/mihaimaruseac/hindent/blob/master/elisp/hindent.el)
  there is `hindent-mode`, which provides keybindings to reindent parts of the
  buffer:

  - `M-q` reformats the current declaration.  When inside a comment, it fills the
    current paragraph instead, like the standard `M-q`.
  - `C-M-\` reformats the current region.

  To enable it, add the following to your init file:

  ```lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/hindent/elisp")
  (require 'hindent)
  (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook #'hindent-mode)
  ```

  ## Vim

  The `'formatprg'` option lets you use an external program (like
  hindent) to format your text. Put the following line into
  ~/.vim/ftplugin/haskell.vim to set this option for Haskell files:

      setlocal formatprg=hindent

  Then you can format with hindent using `gq`. Read `:help gq` and `help
  'formatprg'` for more details.

  Note that unlike in emacs you have to take care of selecting a
  sensible buffer region as input to hindent yourself. If that is too
  much trouble you can try
  [vim-textobj-haskell](https://github.com/gilligan/vim-textobj-haskell)
  which provides a text object for top level bindings.

  In order to format an entire source file execute:

      :%!hindent

  Alternatively you could use the
  [vim-hindent](https://github.com/alx741/vim-hindent) plugin which runs hindent
  automatically when a Haskell file is saved.

  ## IntelliJ / other JetBrains IDEs
  1. Install the "HaskForce" Haskell plugin (this is so we get the language type recognized in the file watcher)
  2. Install the "File Watchers" plugin under "Browse Repositories"
  3. Add a File Watcher with
      1. File type: Haskell Language
      2. Program: `/path/to/hindent`
      3. Arguments: `$FilePath$`
      4. Immediate file synchronization: off
      5. Show console: Error

  Now whenever you save a file, `hindent` should autoformat it.
