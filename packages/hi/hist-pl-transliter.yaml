description: |-
  The library provides a simple embedded domain specific language for
  defining transliteration rules.
  Additionally, the library includes a set of rules prepared (within the SYNAT
  project) for documents collected throughout the IMPACT project (available
  at <http://dl.psnc.pl/activities/projekty/impact/results/>).

  A transliteration system, developed independently within the IMPACT
  project, may be also of interest.
  It can be found at <https://bitbucket.org/jsbien/pol>.
