changelog: |
  1.5.4.0
  =======

  * Addition of `disable-chart` flag
  * Bunch of semi-functional stuff from GSoC 2018

  1.5.2.0
  =======

  * Fixed FFT performace issue
  * Reduced JuicyPixels module compile time and introduced conversion functions.
  * Created `Filter` and implemented few filters: `gaussianBlur`
  * Indroduced `Seq` format wrapper for sequence of images (eg. animated GIFs)

  1.5.2.0
  =======

  * Fixed `Storable` instance for some Pixel types.
  * Fixed reading/writing animated GIFs. Added a detailed example to documentation.
  * Improved encoding/decoding of images.
  * Improved coversion between `ColorSpace`s.

  1.5.1.0
  =======

  * Significantly improved convolution performance.
  * Improved exchanging representation between images, by removing `Exchangable`
    class, but keeping `exchange` function usage unchaged, thus it should be
    backwards compatible up to a type signature.
  * Created general `fromVector` to `toVector` functions
  * Brought back `fromRepaArrayS` and `fromRepaArrayP` functions [#6]

  1.5.0.0
  =======

  * Refactored `Gray` color space to be `X`, in order to reflect it's generality
  * Renamed few core functions:

    * `mapPx` -> `liftPx`,
    * `zipWithPx` -> `liftPx2`,
    * `broadcastC` -> `promote`,
    * `singleton` -> `scalar`.

  * `upsample`/`downsample` functions are now a lot more general.


  1.4.0.1
  =======

  * Fixed the ability to construct complex images by installing `Complex` into `Elevator`
  * Made it possible to write complex images by concatenating real and imaginary part together.
  * Fixed writing images in other representation than `VS`.

  1.4.0.0
  =======

  Major rewrite, with most of functionality is still backwards compatible, but
  with a some extra features.

  * Storable Repa and Vector representations through generic implementations
  * `ColorSpace` is more general allowing for non polymorphic Pixel types
  * `Elevator` works on base types rather than on pixels
  * Conversions from JuicyPixels and NetPbm is done through casting a Vector
    rather than through an explicit conversion.

  Major API changes:

    * Renaming `RS` and `RP` Repa representations into `RSU` and `RPU`.
    * Addition `VS` Storable Vector representationas well as `RSS` and `RPS`
      Storable Repa representations.

  1.3.0.0
  =======

  * Significantly simplified interface:
    * Removed `ManifestArray`, `SequentialArray` and `MutableArray` classes in favor of `MArray`.
  * Rewrite of Repa image representations. Removed `RD` representation.
  * Introduced function `canvasSize`.

  1.2.0.0
  =======

  * Changed `Interpolation` in a way that border resolution is supplied separatly
    from the method.
  * Introduced function `translate`.
  * Added a better test suite. Improved coverage.
  * Fixed a bug with border resolution strategy `Continue`.
  * Added better error messaging for border checks.

  1.1.0.1
  =======

  * Backwards compatibility with GHC 7.8

  1.1.0.0
  =======

  * GHC 8 support.
  * Improved IO:
    * OS default image viewer is used for displaying images with ability to use a custom one.
    * Histogram plotting is done using diagrams instead of cairo backend,
      significantly simplifying installation


  1.0.2.0
  =======

  * Changed the way image displaying works. Now `displayImage` function will try
    to automatically detect the default external viewer program.
  * Renamed module `Graphics.Image.IO.External` to `Graphics.Image.IO.Formats`,
    so it reflects the purpose slightly better.

  1.0.1.2
  =======

  * Added support of "vector>=0.11.0.0"

  1.0.1.1
  =======

  * Added `rotate` function.
  * Fixed writing `RGBA` files with `writeImage` (#2).

  1.0.1
  =====

  * Made it compatible with GHC >= 7.4 (#1)
  * Added histogram plotting using Charts

  Haskell Image Processing Library
  ================================

  Haskell Image Processing (HIP) Library

  Documentation is on [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hip), and [Stackage](https://www.stackage.org/package/hip).

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lehins/hip.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lehins/hip)
  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/hip.svg?style=flat)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hip)

  Installation
  ------------

  Install HIP using `cabal`:

  * `$ cabal update && cabal install hip`

  and using `stack`:

  * `$ stack install hip`

  In order to be able to view images in GHCi an external image viewer is used. You
  can use any viewer that accepts a filename as an argument, and by default, image
  viewer specified by the OS is used.
