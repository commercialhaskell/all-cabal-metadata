  # hi-file-parser

  Provide data types and functions for parsing the binary `.hi` files produced by
  GHC. Intended to support multiple versions of GHC, so that tooling can:

  * Support multiple versions of GHC
  * Avoid linking against the `ghc` library
  * Not need to use `ghc`'s textual dump file format.

  Note that this code was written for Stack's usage initially, though it is
  intended to be general purpose.
