changelog: "Changes in 0.9.1.0\n  * Added `Data.Histogram.Tutorial` module\t\n  *
  GHC 8.6 Compatibility\n\nChanges in 0.9.0.0\n\n  * GHC 8.4 compatibility. Semigroup
  instances added for `HBuilder` and\n    `HBuilderM`. `semigroups` dependency added
  for older GHCs\n\nChanges in 0.8.5.0\n\n  * BinVar added\n  * Redundant constraints
  on functions removed\n  * Histogram data type now stores overflows/underflows as
  strict data type\n  * Support for GHC<7.6 is dropped\n\nChanges in 0.8.4.1\n\n  *
  All fields of LogDinD are strict and unpacked. This fixes NFData\n    instance and
  improves performance\n\n\nChanges in 0.8.4.0\n\n  * Missing instances for CutDirection
  added\n\n  * Missing NFData instances for MaybeBin, BinEnum2D, BinPermute\n\n  *
  Compatibility with deepseq 1.4\n\n\nChanges in 0.8.3.0\n\n  * Constraints are relaxed
  from `PrimMonad' to `Monad' wherever possible in\n    Data.Histogram.Fill module.\n\n\nChanges
  in 0.8.2.0\n\n  * Smart constructors for BinF and BinD check that bin number is
  not\n    negative.\n  * Fixed bug in `binInt'\n  * Fields of `Histogram' data type
  are strict now.\n  * Compatibility with GHC 7.8\n\n\nChanges in 0.8.1.0\n\n  * Constructor
  of @HBuilderM@ exported.\n\n\nChanges in 0.8.0.0\n\n  * `toHBuilderM' added and
  internal definition of `HBuilder' is\n    changed. It required adding dependency
  on @monad-primitive@.\n  * `joinHBuilder' and @treeHBuilder@ are deprecated.\n\n\nChanges
  in 0.7.4.0\n\n  * Function for searching for minimum/maximum added.\n  * @NFData@
  instance is fixed.\n\n\nChanges in 0.7.3.0\n\n  * `mkStatefulBuilder' is added and
  HBuilder constructor is exposed.\n  * Indexing operators for immutable histograms
  are added.\n\n\nChanges in 0.7.2.0\n\n  * fromMaybeBin added.\n\n\nChanges in 0.7.1.0\n\n
  \ * breduceX and breduceY are added.\n\n\nChanges in 0.7.0.0\n\n  * mkFoldBuilder
  is added to `Data.Histogram.Fill'\n  * fill functions in `Data.Histogram.ST' are
  replaced with generic\n    variant.\n  * Indexing for immutable histograms is added
  and special constructor\n    for first and last bin are added to `HistIndex' data
  type.\n  * Functions to calculate sum, minimum and maximum of immutable\n    histogram
  are added.\n\n\nChanges in 0.6.2.0\n\n  * MaybeBin added.\n  * Helper function for
  defining Read instances for bins are exposed.\n  * mapData function is added.\n
  \ * Slicing histogram do not results in crash if indices are out of\n    bounds.\n
  \ * Eq instances for BinF and BinD are added.\n  * NFData instance for Bin2D is
  fixed.\n\n\nChanges in 0.6.1.0\n\n  * Helper function and type synonym for Bin2D\n\n\nChanges
  in 0.6.0.1\n\n  * Fixed compilation with GHC 7.4\n"
