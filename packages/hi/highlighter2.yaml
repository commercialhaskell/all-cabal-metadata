description: |-
  It's fork from original highlighter, with some changes for performance.
  This version work faster (5 - 10 times) for big files (> 1000 lines of code).

  Processes source code using tons of lexers, tokenizing it and formatting it as e.g. HTML.

  Very similar to the Python Pygments library; many lexers directly converted from it.
