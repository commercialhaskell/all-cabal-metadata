description: |-
  This module allows you to incorporate arbitrary files into a haskell module
  during compilation. The files are then available to you through functions
  which allows you to write installer-type applications which write out the
  files when run. Thus this can be considered in the same model as Java .jar
  files or executable zip or other file archives.

  The current implementation is now reasonably efficient. However, it does
  require that you have a C compiler installed which can be invoked through
  @cc@.
