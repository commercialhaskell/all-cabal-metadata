  * Builds again with GHC 7.4
  * Drops dependency on `utf8-string`

  ### 0.4.2.1

  * Changelog should now appear in Hackage
  * Integrated unit tests with cabal

  ### 0.3.3.7

  * Fixed a race condition that would happen, for instance, when two
    process where run one next to the other, making them, on some
    platforms, to get the same random number seed (thanks to Mario
    Pastorelli and Samuel Gélineau)
  * Small fix in documentation (thanks to Daniil Frumin)

  ### 0.3.3.6

  * Works again on GHC 7.2.x (thanks to Björn Peemöller)

    Beltram Felgenhauer)

  ### 0.3.3.4

  * Works on GHC 7.4.1

  ### 0.3.3.3

  * Works on GHC 7.2.1

  ### 0.3.3.2

  * Supports GHC 7

  ### 0.3.3.1

  * Instance declaration for Applicative (InterpreterT m) works with mtl-2
    (requires Applicative m, this shouldn't break anything...)

  ### 0.3.3.0

  * Add unsafeRunInterpreterWithArgs
  * Check that only one instance of the interpreter is run at any time

  ### 0.3.2.3

  * Can be built against MonadCatchIO-mtl-0.3.x.x

  ### 0.3.2.2

  * Fixed a bug that would make expressions using heavy use of the layout
    rule to fail to be interpreted (see parens)

  ### 0.3.2.1

  * hint.cabal includes version bounds for package ghc-mtl. This is to
    avoid the accidental selection of the completely unrelated ghc-mtl
    internal to GHC and, apparently, installed in the hackage server

  ### 0.3.2.0

  * Exports functions parens and isInterpretedModule
  * Experimental support for module annotations
  * Uses extensible-exceptions in order to provide a uniform interface
    across different ghc versions
  * Provides an Applicative instance for IntepreterT
  * Adds an option to configurate the searchPath

  ### 0.3.1.0

  * No longer uses Language.Haskell.Extension due to configuration
    problems with Cabal. Instead, it uses its own
    Language.Haskell.Interpreter.Extension module.

  ### 0.3.0.0

  * Updated API:
    + InterpreterT monad transformer (Interpreter = InterpreterT IO)
    + No more Sessions, use runInterpreter only once
    + New options handling functions
      - but observe that there is no setOptimizations equivalent; since
        GHC does no optimization on interpreted code, this was actually
        doing nothing
  * Works with GHC 6.10 and 6.8 (untested with 6.6)

  ### 0.2.5

  * setImportsQ added (modules can be imported both qualified and
    unqualified)

  ### 0.2.4.1

  * BUGFIX: No longer fails on expressions ending in a -- comment

  ### 0.2.4

  * setInstalledModsAreInScopeQualified added
  * Now depends on ghc-paths (no longer needs a custom cabal script)

  ### 0.2.2

  * setOptimizations added
  * Module Language.Haskell.Interpreter.GHC.Unsafe added (contains
    unsafeSetGhcOption)
  * Unit tests now based on HUnit

  ### 0.2.1

  * BUGFIX: Module reloading was broken under 6.8
  * GHC.GhcExceptions are catched and turned into InterpreterErrors

  ### 0.2.0.1

  * Adds the requirement cabal-version < 1.3

  ### 0.2

  * Works also with GHC 6.8 and 6.6
  * Added the getModuleExports function
  * withSession function throws a dynamic exception instead of returning
    Either Error a
  * Requires Cabal 1.2.x

  # hint [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/hint.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hint) [![Build Status](https://github.com/haskell-hint/hint/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/haskell-hint/hint/actions)

  This library defines an Interpreter monad within which you can interpret
  strings like `"[1,2] ++ [3]"` into values like `[1,2,3]`. You can easily
  exchange data between your compiled program and your interpreted program, as
  long as the data has a `Typeable` instance.

  You can choose which modules should be in scope while evaluating these
  expressions, you can browse the contents of those modules, and you can ask for
  the type of the identifiers you're browsing.

  ## Example

      {-# LANGUAGE LambdaCase, ScopedTypeVariables, TypeApplications #-}
      import Control.Exception (throwIO)
      import Control.Monad (when)
      import Control.Monad.Trans.Class (lift)
      import Control.Monad.Trans.Writer (execWriterT, tell)
      import Data.Foldable (for_)
      import Data.List (isPrefixOf)
      import Data.Typeable (Typeable)
      import qualified Language.Haskell.Interpreter as Hint

      -- |
      -- Interpret expressions into values:
      --
      -- >>> eval @[Int] "[1,2] ++ [3]"
      -- Right [1,2,3]
      --
      -- Send values from your compiled program to your interpreted program by
      -- interpreting a function:
      --
      -- >>> Right f <- eval @(Int -> [Int]) "\\x -> [1..x]"
      -- >>> f 5
      -- [1,2,3,4,5]
      eval :: forall t. Typeable t
           => String -> IO (Either Hint.InterpreterError t)
      eval s = Hint.runInterpreter $ do
        Hint.setImports ["Prelude"]
        Hint.interpret s (Hint.as :: t)

      -- |
      -- >>> :{
      -- do Right contents <- browse "Prelude"
      --    for_ contents $ \(identifier, tp) -> do
      --      when ("put" `isPrefixOf` identifier) $ do
      --        putStrLn $ identifier ++ " :: " ++ tp
      -- :}
      -- putChar :: Char -> IO ()
      -- putStr :: String -> IO ()
      -- putStrLn :: String -> IO ()
      browse :: Hint.ModuleName -> IO (Either Hint.InterpreterError [(String, String)])
      browse moduleName = Hint.runInterpreter $ do
        Hint.setImports ["Prelude", "Data.Typeable", moduleName]
        exports <- Hint.getModuleExports moduleName
        execWriterT $ do
          for_ exports $ \case
            Hint.Fun identifier -> do
              tp <- lift $ Hint.typeOf identifier
              tell [(identifier, tp)]
            _ -> pure ()  -- skip datatypes and typeclasses

  Check [example.hs](examples/example.hs) for a longer example (it must be run
  from hint's base directory).

  ## Limitations

  Importing a module from the current package is not supported. It might look
  like it works on one day and then segfault the next day. You have been warned.

  To work around this limitation, move those modules to a separate package. Now
  the part of your code which calls hint and the code interpreted by hint can
  both import that module.

  It is not possible to exchange a value [whose type involves an implicit kind
  parameter](https://github.com/haskell-hint/hint/issues/159#issuecomment-1575629607).
  This includes type-level lists. To work around this limitation, [define a
  newtype wrapper which wraps the type you
  want](https://github.com/haskell-hint/hint/issues/159#issuecomment-1575640606).

  It is possible to run the interpreter inside a thread, but on GHC 8.8 and
  below, you can't run two instances of the interpreter simultaneously.

  GHC must be installed on the system on which the compiled executable is
  running. There is a workaround for this but [it's not trivial](https://github.com/haskell-hint/hint/issues/80#issuecomment-963109968).

  The packages used by the interpreted code must be installed in a package
  database, and hint needs to be told about that package database at runtime.

  The most common use case for package databases is for the interpreted code to
  have access to the same packages as the compiled code (but not compiled code
  itself). The easiest way to accomplish this is via a
  [GHC environment file](https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/packages.html#package-environments),
  and the easiest way to generate a GHC environment file is
  [via cabal](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/3.4/cabal-project.html#cfg-field-write-ghc-environment-files).
  Compile your code using `cabal build --write-ghc-environment-files=always`;
  this will create a file named `.ghc.environment.<something>` in the current
  directory. At runtime, hint will look for that file in the current directory.

  For more advanced use cases, you can use
  [`unsafeRunInterpreterWithArgs`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hint/docs/Language-Haskell-Interpreter-Unsafe.html#v:unsafeRunInterpreterWithArgs)
  to pass arguments to the underlying ghc library, such as
  [`-package-db`](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/users_guide/packages.html?highlight=package%20db#ghc-flag--package-db%20%E2%9F%A8file%E2%9F%A9)
  to specify a path to a package database, or
  [`-package-env`](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/users_guide/packages.html?highlight=package%20db#ghc-flag--package-env%20%E2%9F%A8file%E2%9F%A9%7C%E2%9F%A8name%E2%9F%A9)
  to specify a path to a GHC environment file.
