  # Changelog for vega-view

  ## 0.2

  The directory view now displays all the visualizations in a directory,
  and hides those files that are not JSON. Selecting a visualization can
  now open it in a new page (0.1 behavior) or inline (new).

  # vega-view

  I am not 100% convinced this is a worthwhile project, but let's see how
  it goes. You can think of it as "I want
  [vega desktop](https://github.com/vega/vega-desktop) but don't want
  to install an electron application, so decided to write an inferior
  product" project.

  The aim is to make it easy to view
  [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/)
  and
  [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)
  specifications - i.e. the JSON representing a visualization - as
  a visualization. It relies on
  [Vega Embed](https://github.com/vega/vega-embed) to do all
  the hard work, and just provides a basic web server that will list the
  files in a given directory and, when selected, create the
  call to Vega Embed.

  ## License

  This is released under a BSD3 license.

  ## Usage

  The server - called `vega-view` - should be run from the directory
  containing the specifications to view. It then provides a web server
  on port 8082 that can be used to view them at the URL

      http://localhost:8082/display/

  Visualizations can either be viewed as their own "page", or inline,
  which may be more useful when you have multiple plots to view.

  The aim is to be run in a a directory structure where most, if not
  all, the files are Vega or Vega-Lite specifications. This means that
  the web server tries to parse each file as JSON, which could cause
  memory- or time- issues if there are large non-JSON files in the
  directory tree.

  ## GHC support

  This is currently a **very basic** application, so will hopefully build
  against a wide variety of GHC installations. There has been /no/ testing
  on Windows.
