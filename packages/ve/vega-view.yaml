  # Changelog for vega-view

  ## 0.3.1.7

  Bump aeson and scotty dependencies and try Yet-Another-Nix setup.

  ## 0.3.1.6

  Update to Vega Lite version 4 and drop the version requirement on
  Vega Embed (Javascript libraries).

  Directory listing now has a scroll bar so that it doesn't extend beyond
  the bottom of the page (ish), which makes it much easier when flipping
  between in-line visualizations.

  ## 0.3.1.5

  Report that an error occurred when the embed option failed, which is
  better than the previous behavior (no plot would appear but no
  indication that something happened), but the message is pretty anodyne.

  ## 0.3.1.4

  Change the layout of the "directory with visualizations" page to move
  the inline view to the right of the list of files. The way the files
  are listed has also been changed to reduce horizontal space and remove
  some repetition.

  The SVG used for the "right-arrow" comes from the free version of
  fontawesome, version 5.10.2 (arrow-alt-circle-right).

  ## 0.3.1.3

  Change the appearance and linking of directory names, in the "label"
  of a plot (drop the path and show just the file name), and on the web
  pages. A common stanza is used to indicate the current directory or file
  and the path to the "parent".

  There have been style changes to how the inline plots are displayed,
  to allow them to be horizontally scrolled.

  ## 0.3.1.2

  The "view a visualization" page - i.e. /display/..path-to-spec - now
  adds a horizontal scroll bar if the visualization is too wide for the
  page. Unfortunately this doesn't happen on the drag-and-drop or inline
  views.

  ## 0.3.1.1

  Change the styling of the "frame" used to contain a Vega or Vega-Lite
  visualization. The main change is to add a "hide" button (for the inline
  and drag-and-drop views), but there's also a few more-subtle changes.

  ## 0.3.1.0

  The default port is 8082 but this can be changed by setting the PORT
  environment variable before running the server. An invalid setting, or
  one already in use, will cause the application to fail with a less-than
  graceful error message.

  ## 0.3.0.5

  Improved error handling when displaying Vega or Vega-Lite specifications,
  in that the error message from vega-embed is now shown to the viewer rather
  than hidden away in the console log. It is not clear to me how useful these
  error messages are, other than just to say "hey, something went wrong".

  The filenames for the export-to-svg/png options now uses the specification
  file name rather than the default "visualization". There is no attempt to
  remove any suffixes from the file name, so "foo.vg.json" will end up as
  "foo.vg.json.svg" (or .png).

  Removed paths from file names in the directory listings, and also stopped
  dropping their suffixes.

  ## 0.3.0.4

  Fixed directory browsing: previously things didn't work out so well if
  there were no Vega or Vega-Lite visualizations in the working directory,
  but now you can properly recurse into sub-directories.

  ## 0.3.0.3

  Oops: chaning from a bytestring to a text during development caused
  "problems". There really should be a swooshy icon on the home page now,
  and the a text rendering of the SVG...

  ## 0.3.0.2

  Add a link back to the "home page" in the page header.

  The home page has a swooshy icon on it, to try and visually indicate
  that you can drag onto the page.

  ## 0.3.0.1

  Tweak the styling on some of the pages to use the "new look"â„¢.

  ## 0.3.0.0

  Add drag-and-drop support to the main page. You can now drag in a file
  (or multiple files) and have their contents be displayed. There is a mode
  for selecting how new visualizations are added to the page: at the top
  (default), at the bottom, or clear-out any previous plots.

  ## 0.2.0.2

  Bump base minimum version to supporg ghc 8 or later, to save
  hackage trying to build with older versions. There is no user-visible
  change to version 0.2.

  ## 0.2.0.1

  Internal change to get it to build with ghc 8.2 and 8.0.

  ## 0.2

  The directory view now displays all the visualizations in a directory,
  and hides those files that are not JSON. Selecting a visualization can
  now open it in a new page (0.1 behavior) or inline (new).

description: "# vega-view\n\nI am not 100% convinced this is a worthwhile project,
  but let's see how\nit goes. You can think of it as \"I want\n[vega desktop](https://github.com/vega/vega-desktop)
  but don't want\nto install an electron application, so decided to write an inferior\nproduct\"
  project.\n\nThe aim is to make it easy to view\n[Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/)\nand\n[Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)\nspecifications
  - i.e. the JSON representing a visualization - as\na visualization. It relies on\n[Vega
  Embed](https://github.com/vega/vega-embed) to do all\nthe hard work, and just provides
  a basic web server that:\n\n - you can drag-and-drop files onto to view them;\n
  \n - and will list the files in a given directory and, when selected,\n   view them
  inline or on a separate page.\n\n![A Vega-Lite specification being dragged from
  a file browser and dropped onto the index page of the vega-view web server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DougBurke/vega-view/master/images/vega-view-drag-n-drop.gif)\n\n##
  License\n\nThis is released under a BSD3 license.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe server - called
  `vega-view` - should be run from the directory\ncontaining the specifications to
  view. It then provides a web server\non port 8082 (unless the `PORT` environment
  variable is set, in\nwhich case this value is used instead) that can be used to
  view them\nat the URLs\n\n    http://localhost:8082/\n    http://localhost:8082/display/\n\n(where
  `8082` should be replaced by the value of `$PORT` if set).\n\nThe first page lets
  you drag-and-drop files onto the page to view\nthem. Thse second lets you browse
  the visualizations that are present\nin the diectory where you started the application.
  Thse can either be\nviewed as their own \"page\", or inline, which may be more useful
  when\nyou have multiple plots to view.\n\nThe aim is to be run in a a directory
  structure where most, if not\nall, the files are Vega or Vega-Lite specifications.
  This means that\nthe web server tries to parse each file as JSON, which could cause\nmemory-
  or time- issues if there are large non-JSON files in the\ndirectory tree.\n\n##
  GHC support\n\nThis is currently a **very basic** application, so will hopefully
  build\nagainst a wide variety of GHC installations. There has been /no/ testing\non
  Windows.\n\n## Bugs and Issues\n\nPlease use the [issues list](https://github.com/DougBurke/vega-view/issues)\nto
  report any problems.\n"
