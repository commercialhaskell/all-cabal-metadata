  [![FPGA'20 DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/FPGA'20%20DOI-10.1145%2F3373087.3375310-blue)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3373087.3375310)

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/verismith?color=614f88)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/verismith)

  Verilog Fuzzer to test the major verilog compilers by generating random, valid and deterministic Verilog.

  It currently supports the following synthesis tools:

  - [Yosys](http://www.clifford.at/yosys/)
  - [Xst](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/xilinx11/ise_c_using_xst_for_synthesis.htm)
  - [Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/ise-design-suite.html)
  - [Quartus](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/downloads/download-center.html)

  and the following simulator:

  - [Icarus Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com)

  ## Supported Verilog Constructs

  The fuzzer generates combinational and behavioural Verilog to test the various tools. The most notable constructs that are supported and generated are the following:

  - module definitions with parameter definitions, inputs and outputs
  - module items, such as instantiations, continuous assignment, always blocks,
    initial blocks, parameter and local parameter declarations
  - most expressions, for example concatenation, arithmetic operations, ternary
      conditional operator
  - behavioural code in sequential always blocks
  - behavioural control flow such as if-else and for loops
  - declaration of wires and variables of any size, signed or unsigned
  - bit selection from wires and variables

  ## Reported bugs

  11 bugs have been reported and confirmed to be bugs by the vendors, out of which 4 have been fixed. 1 bug has also been found in the Icarus Verilog simulator as a side effect of using it to verify equivalence check results.

  ## Install the Fuzzer

  The fuzzer now supports building with [nix](https://nixos.org/nix/manual/), which pulls in all the extra dependencies that are needed to build the project. The main files and their functions are described below:

  - `default.nix`: describes the main Haskell package and it's dependencies that
    have to be pulled in.
  - `shell.nix`: describes how to set up a shell with `nix-shell` which has all
    the needed dependencies present.
  - `release.nix`: passes the versions of the packages that should be used to the
    description of the fuzzer in `default.nix`, which also overrides some
    dependencies so that everything builds nicely. The exact versions of the
    packages that should be overridden are in [nix](/nix).

  It may be possible to build it purely with [cabal-install](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-install), however it may not have all the right versions of the dependencies that are needed.

  Instead, stack could be used and the `stack.yaml` file could contain the overrides that are used by nix.

  ### Build from hackage

  Some external packages are required to use Verismith properly:

  - [Yosys](https://github.com/yosyshq/yosys) with ABC
  - [SymbiYosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/SymbiYosys)
  - [Icarus Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/)
  - (Optional) [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3)
  - (Optional) [Xst](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/xilinx11/ise_c_using_xst_for_synthesis.htm)
  - (Optional) [Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/ise-design-suite.html)
  - (Optional) [Quartus](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/downloads/download-center.html)

  A stable version of Verismith is available on [hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/verismith) and can be installed using cabal directly without having to build the project from the repository:

  **Note**: A recent version of GHC is recommended, such as GHC 9.6.4.

  ``` shell
  cabal install verismith
  ```

  It will be placed under the `bin` cabal folder which can be added to your path to run Verismith.

  ### Build with nix from source

  Nix build is completely supported, therefore if nix is installed, building the project is as simple as

  ``` shell
  nix-build
  ```

  If one wants to work in the project with all the right dependencies loaded, one can use

  ``` shell
  nix-shell
  ```

  and use cabal to build and run the program.

  ### Build with cabal from source

  After entering a development environment with `nix-shell`, the project can safely be built with `cabal-install`. However, even without `nix`, the project can still be built with cabal alone using:

  ``` shell
  cabal update     # needed if cabal is used for the first time
  cabal configure
  cabal build
  ```

  Verismith can then be run using:

  ``` shell
  cabal run verismith
  ```

  ## Configuration

  Verismith can be configured using a [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) file. There are four main sections in the configuration file, an example can be seen [here](/examples/config.toml).

  ### Information section

  Contains information about the command line tool being used, such as the hash of the commit it was compiled with and the version of the tool. The tool then verifies that these match the current configuration, and will emit a warning if they do not. This ensures that if one wants a deterministic run and is therefore passing a seed to the generation, that it will always give the same result. Different versions might change some aspects of the Verilog generation, which would affect how a seed would generate Verilog.

  ### Probability section

  Provides a way to assign frequency values to each of the nodes in the AST. During the state-based generation, each node is chosen randomly based on those probabilities. This provides a simple way to drastically change the Verilog that is generated, by changing how often a construct is chosen or by not generating a construct at all.

  ### Property section

  Changes properties of the generated Verilog code, such as the size of the output, maximum statement or module depth and sampling method of Verilog programs. This section also allows a seed to be specified, which would mean that only that particular seed will be used in the fuzz run. This is extremely useful when wanting to replay a specific failure and the output is missing.

  ### Synthesiser section

  Accepts a list of synthesisers which will be fuzzed. These have to first be defined in the code and implement the required interface. They can then be configured by having a name assigned to them and the name of the output Verilog file. By each having a different name, multiple instances of the same synthesiser can be included in a fuzz run. The instances might differ in the optimisations that are performed, or in the version of the synthesiser.

  ## Acknowledgement

  Clifford Wolf's [VlogHammer](http://www.clifford.at/yosys/vloghammer.html) is an existing Verilog fuzzer that generates random Verilog to test how expressions are handled in synthesis tools and simulators. It was the inspiration for thegeneral structure of this fuzzer, which extends the fuzzing to the behavioural parts of Verilog.

  Tom Hawkins' Verilog parser was used to write the lexer, the parser was then rewritten using [Parsec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec).
