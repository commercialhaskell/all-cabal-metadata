  # Changelog

  ## 3.5.1.1
  - GHC 8.8 compatibility.

  ## 3.5.0
  - Updated to `megaparsec-7`. Our `ParsingError` type alias has changed to match
    Megaparsec's new error model, and `errorBundlePretty` is now exposed instead of
    the old `parseErrorPretty`.

  ## 3.4.0.1
  - Enhanced the whitespace handling in `semver'`, `version'`, and `mess'`.

  ## 3.4.0
  - Removed `ParseV` and surrounding machinery.
    Use `versioning` now instead of the `parseV` function.

  ## 3.3.2
  - GHC 8.4.1 compatibility.

  ## 3.3.0
  - New `Semantic` typeclass that provides Traversals for SemVer-like data out
    of all the version types. `Text` was also given an instance, so its much
    easier to manipulate directly:

  ```
  λ "1.2.3" & minor %~ (+ 1)
  "1.3.3"
  ```

  Some Lenses and Traversals had their names changed or were removed entirely
  to accomodate this new typeclass.

  - `SemVer` and `Version` should never contain negative values, so their numeric
    components were changed from `Int` to `Word`.

  ## 3.2.0
  - Updated for `megaparsec-6` and GHC 8.2.

  ## 3.1.1
  - Added instances for common typeclasses: `Generic`, `NFData`, and
    `Hashable`. This is to avoid having users define these instances themselves
    as orphans. If there are more instances you want added, please let me know.
    `Data` was left out on purpose.

  ## 3.1.0
  - Added support for *epoch* numbers in the `Version` type. These are numbers
    like the `1:` in `1:2.3.4`. These are used in Arch Linux in rare cases where
    packages change their versioning scheme, but need a reliable integer prefix
    to establish ordering. The `Version` type has been given a new field,
    `_vEpoch :: Maybe Int`, and a corresponding lens, `vEpoch`.

  ## 3.0.2
  - Expose internal parsers so that they could be used in other parser programs
    that parse version numbers in larger files.

  ## 3.0.0
  - Updated for `megaparsec-5` and `ghc-8`

  ## 2.0.0
  - Switched to `megaparsec` to perform all parsing as `Text`
  - Support for legacy `String` removed
  - Added more Traversals and INLINE'd all Lenses/Traversals

  ## 1.1.0
  - Added Lenses and Traversals (no `lens` dependency)

  A Haskell library for parsing and comparing software version numbers.

  About
  -----
  We like to give version numbers to our software in a myriad of ways. Some
  ways follow strict guidelines for incrementing and comparison. Some follow
  conventional wisdom and are generally self-consistent. Some are just plain
  asinine. This library provides a means of parsing and comparing *any* style
  of versioning, be it a nice Semantic Version like this:

  > 1.2.3-r1+git123

  ...or a monstrosity like this:

  > 2:10.2+0.0093r3+1-1

  Please switch to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) if you aren't
  currently using it. It provides consistency in version incrementing and has
  the best constraints on comparisons.

  Usage
  -----
  In general, `versioning` is the function you want. It attempts to parse a given
  Text using the three individual parsers, `semver`, `version` and `mess`. If
  one fails, it tries the next. If you know you only want to parse one
  specific version type, use that parser directly (e.g. `semver`).

  #### Lenses and Traversals
  The parse result types have Lenses/Traversals for accessing their data
  fields. For instance, to increment the patch number of a parsed SemVer, you
  could:

  ```haskell
  incPatch :: SemVer -> SemVer
  incPatch s = s & patch %~ (+ 1)
  ```

  Or, something more involved:

  ```haskell
  -- | Get all major versions of legally parsed SemVers.
  majors :: [Text] -> [Word]
  majors vs = vs ^.. each . to semver . _Right . major
  ```

  The `to semver . _Right` is clunky, so we provide some direct `Text`
  Traverals inspired by
  ([micro](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-aeson))
  [lens-aeson](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-aeson):

  ```haskell
  -- | Get the major version of any `Text` that has one.
  majors :: [Text] -> [Word]
  majors vs = vs ^.. each . major
  ```

  We can also use these `Text` Traversals to increment versions, as above:

  ```haskell
  incPatch :: Text -> Text
  incPatch s = s & patch %~ (+ 1)

  > incPatch "1.2.3"
  "1.2.4"
  ```
