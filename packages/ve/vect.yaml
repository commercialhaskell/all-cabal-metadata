description: |-
  A low-dimensional (2, 3 and 4) linear algebra library,
  with lots of useful functions. Intended usage is primarily
  computer graphics (basic OpenGL support is included as a separate package).
  Projective 4 dimensional operations, as used in eg. OpenGL,
  are also supported; and so are quaternions.
  The base field is either Float or Double.
