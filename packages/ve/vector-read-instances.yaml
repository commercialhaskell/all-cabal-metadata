description: |-
  Read instances for 'Data.Vector'. Right now, only for unboxed
  vectors. Others should be easy to implement, though.

  It is planned to have read instances included in the vector
  library in the future. This release is only temporary.

  vector >= 0.8 has Read instances for all immutable vectors.
