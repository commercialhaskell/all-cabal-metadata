description: ! '# Vector Sized


  This package exports a newtype tagging the vectors from the

  [vector](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector) package with a type level

  natural representing their size.

  It also exports a few functions from vector appropriately retyped.


  This package is fairly similar to

  the [fixed-vector](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fixed-vector) package.

  While both provide vectors of statically know length they use completely

  different implementation with different tradeoffs. `vector-sized` is a newtype

  wrapper over `vector` thus it''s able to handle vectors of arbitrary length but

  have to carry runtime representation of length which is significant memory

  overhead for small vectors. `fixed-vector` defines all functions as

  manipulations of Church-encoded product types (`∀r. (a→a→r) → r` for 2D vectors)

  so it can work for both arbitrary product types like `data V2 a = V2 a a` and

  opaque length-parametrized vectors provided by library. As consequence of

  implementation it can''t handle vectors larger than tens of elements.



  The initial code for this package was written by @bgamari in a [PR for vulkan](https://github.com/expipiplus1/vulkan/pull/1)
