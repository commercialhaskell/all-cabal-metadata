description: |-
  Vectors are represented by lists with type-encoded lengths. The constructor
  is @:.@, which acts like a cons both at the value and type levels, with @()@
  taking the place of nil. So @x:.y:.z:.()@ is a 3d vector. The library
  provides a set of common list-like functions (map, fold, etc) for working
  with vectors. Built up from these functions are a small but useful set of
  linear algebra operations: matrix multiplication, determinants, solving
  linear systems, inverting matrices.
