  # Revision history for boring

  ## 0.1.1

  - Add `Data.Vec.DataFamily.SpineStrict` module
  - Add `Data.Vec.DataFamily.SpineStrict.Pigeonhole` module:
    this let us define `Representable` in a handy way.

  ## 0.1

  - Reverse dependencies with `boring`.
  - GHC-8.4.1 support

  ## 0

  - First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  This package provides length-indexed (sized) lists, also known as vectors.

  @
  data Vec n a where
  \    VNil  :: Vec 'Nat.Z a
  \    (:::) :: a -> Vec n a -> Vec ('Nat.S n) a
  @

  The functions are implemented in four flavours:

  * __naive__: with explicit recursion. It's simple, constraint-less, yet slow.

  * __pull__: using @Fin n -> a@ representation, which fuses well,
  but makes some programs hard to write. And

  * __data-family__: which allows lazy pattern matching

  * __inline__: which exploits how GHC dictionary inlining works, unrolling
  recursion if the size of 'Vec' is known statically.

  As best approach depends on the application, @vec@ doesn't do any magic
  transformation. Benchmark your code.

  This package uses [fin](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fin), i.e. not @GHC.TypeLits@, for indexes.

  See [Hasochism: the pleasure and pain of dependently typed haskell programming](https://doi.org/10.1145/2503778.2503786)
  by Sam Lindley and Conor McBride for answers to /how/ and /why/.
  Read [APLicative Programming with Naperian Functors](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-54434-1_21)
  by Jeremy Gibbons for (not so) different ones.

  === Similar packages

  * [linear](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/linear) has 'V' type,
  which uses 'Vector' from @vector@ package as backing store.
  @Vec@ is a real GADT, but tries to provide as many useful instances (upto @lens@).

  * [vector-sized](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-sized)
  Great package using @GHC.TypeLits@. Current version (0.6.1.0) uses
  @finite-typelits@ and @Int@ indexes.

  * [sized-vector](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sized-vector) depends
  on @singletons@ package. @vec@ isn't light on dependencies either,
  but try to provide wide GHC support.

  * [fixed-vector](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fixed-vector)

  * [sized](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sized) also depends
  on a @singletons@ package. The @Sized f n a@ type is generalisation of
  @linear@'s @V@ for any @ListLike@.

  * [clash-prelude](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/clash-prelude)
  is a kitchen sink package, which has @CLaSH.Sized.Vector@ module.
  Also depends on @singletons@.
