  [![CI
  tests](https://github.com/jgm/emojis/workflows/CI%20tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jgm/emojis/actions)

  This package provides functions for looking up an emoji by its name
  (alias), and for returning the aliases of an emoji.

  A full list of (alias, emoji) pairs is also exported.

  Emoji data (`emoji.json`) is taken from the
  [`gemoji`](https://github.com/github/gemoji) gem, used by GitHub.  To
  regenerate the `emoji.json` datafile from the latest gemoji source, do `make
  emoji.json`.  If `emoji.json` has changed, do `make` to regenerate the
  `emojis.inc` file and rebuild the project.

  This package has the following advantages over the `emoji` package on Hackage:

  - It supports a fuller range of emojis, including all those supported by GitHub
  - It supports lookup of emoji aliases from emoji
  - It uses Text rather than String
  - It has a lighter dependency footprint: in particular, it does not require aeson
  - It does not require TemplateHaskell
