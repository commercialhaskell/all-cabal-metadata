  This Haskell module wraps around the
  [`email-validate`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/email-validate) package,
  providing a newtype wrapper around the `EmailAddress` type. Our `EmailAddress`
  type has additional typeclass instances, including aeson's
  [ToJSON](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson/docs/Data-Aeson.html#t:ToJSON)
  and
  [FromJSON](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson/docs/Data-Aeson.html#t:FromJSON).
  This allows us to use the `EmailAddress` type without fear of orphan instances.

  This package exposes the module `Text.EmailAddress`. It can be used as a
  drop-in replacement for
  [`email-validate`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/email-validate).

  If you would like to add new instances for `EmailAddress`, please send a pull
  request.  Any instace for a typeclass from a package in stackage will be
  accepted.
