  - Improve the docs job, improve the site, fix minor errors (see [#228](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/228))
  - Fix `hlint` warnings (see [#241](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/241))
  - CI: run doctests (see [#230](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/230))
  - CI: switch back to the official `stack-action` (see [#246](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/246))
  - CI: publish extra files in artifacts (in particular, dependencies like `bool.phi`, see [#245](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/245))

  ## v0.3.0 — 2024-03-26

  In this version the main executable has been renamed to `normalizer`
  and several commands have been implemented for normalization, dataization,
  and reporting.

  New:

  - Command Line Interface:
    - Add commands:
      - `normalizer transform` to perform normalization without executing any atoms (was default behavior before)
      - `normalizer metrics` to compute metrics of a given φ-expression (see [#153](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/153))
      - `normalizer dataize` to run partial evaluation of φ-expressions with atoms (see [#187](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/187))
      - `normalizer report` to generate report based on the results of testing against the EO compiler (see [#213](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/213))
    - Add `--single` flag (see [#131](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/131))
    - Add `--json` flag for machine-readable output format (see [#143](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/143))
    - Add `--max-depth=N` and `--max-term-size=N` options to control limits for the normalizer (see [#173](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/173))
    - Improve `--chain` option to provide better elaboration on the applied normalization rules and the dataization process (see [#195](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/195))
  - Update rule set for φ-calculus (see [#152](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/152) and some changes in [#136](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/136) and [#166](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/166))
  - Add property-based and regression tests for confluence (see [#136](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/136) and [#166](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/166))
  - Tests and metrics against the EO compiler and standard EO test suite (see [#98](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/98), [#191](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/191))

  Fixes:

  - Count metrics, including dataless objects, correctly (see [#142](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/142), [#193](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/193), [#211](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/211))
  - Fix metavariables in context patterns (see [#174](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/174))
  - Support empty Δ-bindings (see [#184](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/184))

  Documentation has been improved (see [#134](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/134), [#221](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/221)).

  Maintenance:

  - Run CI on all pull requests (see [#156](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/156))
  - Downgrade Stackage snapshot (see [#146](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/146))
  - Add HLint to CI (see [#157](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/157))

  ## v0.2.0 — 2024-02-16

  - Complete implementation of Yegor's rules (see [#109](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/109), [#112](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/112))
    - Support global counter in user-defined rules (see [#105](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/105))
    - Context matching (global object and this object, see [#99](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/99))
  - Fix grammar for $\varphi$-calculus (see [#97](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/97) and [#127](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/127))
  - Improve documentation:
    - Set up wesbite for documentation (see [#104](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/104), [#124](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/124), and [#128](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/128))
    - Update CLI documentation (see [#113](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/113))
  - Improve command line interface:
    - Support `--output`/`-o` command line option (see [#92](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/92))
    - Remove logs from default output (see [#106](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/106))
  - Allow collection of metrics for $\varphi$-terms (see [#121](https://github.com/objectionary/normalizer/pull/121))
