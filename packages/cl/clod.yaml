  # Clod - Claude Loader

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/clod.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/clod)
  [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

  Clod is a utility for preparing and uploading files to Claude AI's Project Knowledge feature. It tracks file changes using checksums, respects `.gitignore` and `.clodignore` patterns, and optimizes filenames for Claude's UI. By efficiently handling file selection and staging, it can significantly reduce AI development costs by 50% or more.

  See [HUMAN.md](HUMAN.md) for a complete workflow guide to using `clod` with Claude AI.

  For information about the capability-based security model, see [CAPABILITY_SECURITY.md](CAPABILITY_SECURITY.md).

  For details on man page integration, see [MAN_PAGES.md](MAN_PAGES.md) and [INSTALLING.md](INSTALLING.md).

  Developed by [BionicFuzz](https://bionicfuzz.com) - World-class technical leadership and execution.

  ## Features

  - Track modified files using checksums for accuracy
  - Detect renamed files by matching content checksums
  - Respect `.gitignore` and `.clodignore` patterns
  - Handle binary vs. text files automatically
  - Use system temporary directories for staging files
  - Create optimized filenames for Claude's UI
  - Generate a path manifest for mapping optimized names back to original paths
  - Color-coded, user-friendly terminal interface
  - Capability-based security for file operations
  - Simple, well-structured monad stack for reliable behavior

  ## Installation

  ### From Hackage

  ```bash
  cabal install clod
  ```

  ### From Source

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/fuzz/clod.git
  cd clod
  cabal install
  ```

  For detailed installation instructions, including how to install man pages, see [INSTALLING.md](INSTALLING.md).

  Man pages are automatically installed when using package managers like Homebrew:
  ```bash
  # On macOS
  brew tap fuzz/tap
  brew install clod
  # Or in one command:
  brew install fuzz/tap/clod
  ```

  When installing from Hackage, the man pages are included in the package.

  The `clod` program is installed automatically when using `cabal install`.

  ### Prerequisites

  - GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) 9.0 or newer
  - libmagic (required for file type detection)

  **Cross-Platform Support:** Clod works on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The program outputs the path to the staging directory, making it easy to open with your system's file browser or use with any command that accepts a directory path.

  Supported file browsers:
  * macOS: `open`
  * Linux: `xdg-open`, `gio`, `gnome-open`, or `kde-open`
  * Windows: `explorer.exe`

  Pull requests for improved cross-platform support are welcome.

  ## Usage

  ### Basic Usage

  ```bash
  # Process modified files since last run
  clod

  # Process all files (respecting .gitignore and .clodignore)
  clod --all

  # Run in test mode with an optional test directory
  clod --test

  # On macOS, process files and open the staging directory in Finder
  open `clod`
  ```

  ### Command-Line Options

  - `--all`, `-a`: Process all files, not just modified ones
  - `--test`, `-t`: Run in test mode (no prompts, useful for CI)
  - `--staging-dir DIR`, `-d DIR`: Specify a directory for test mode (only used with --test)
  - `--verbose`, `-v`: Enable verbose output
  - `--flush`, `-f`: Flush stale entries from the checksums database
  - `--last`, `-l`: Reuse the previous staging directory
  - `--help`: Show help information
  - `--version`: Show version information

  ### Opening the Staging Directory

  Clod outputs the path to the staging directory, which you can use to open it directly in your file browser:

  ```bash
  # On macOS, process files and open the directory in Finder
  open `clod [options]`

  # For scripts, you can capture the output and open it with your preferred application
  STAGING_DIR=$(clod [options])

  # Open with the appropriate command for your platform
  # macOS
  open "$STAGING_DIR"
  # Linux
  xdg-open "$STAGING_DIR"  # or gio, gnome-open, kde-open
  # Windows
  explorer.exe "$STAGING_DIR"
  ```

  ### First Run

  On first run, Clod will:

  1. Create a system temporary directory for staging files
  2. Create a default `.clodignore` file if one doesn't exist
  3. Prompt you to choose which files to process:
     - All files
     - Only modified files
     - None (just set timestamp)

  ### Integration with Claude AI

  After running Clod:

  1. Navigate to Project Knowledge in your Claude Project (Pro or Team account required)
  2. Drag files from the opened staging folder to Project Knowledge
  3. Include the `_path_manifest.dhall` file which maps optimized names back to original paths
  4. Paste the contents of `project-instructions.md` into the Project Instructions section
  5. **Important**: You must manually delete previous versions of these files from Project Knowledge before starting a new conversation to ensure Claude uses the most recent files
  6. Note that the staging directory is temporary and will be cleaned up on your next run of clod (or system reboot)

  ## Configuration

  ### Environment Variables

  You can customize Clod's behavior using these environment variables:

  - `CLOD_DIR` - Override the default `.clod` directory name
  - `CLODIGNORE` - Override the default `.clodignore` filename

  ### .clodignore

  A `.clodignore` file in your repository root specifies files or patterns to exclude. If this file doesn't exist, Clod will create a default one for you with common patterns for binary files, build directories, and large files.

  ## Development Utilities

  The Clod package includes a testing utility:

  ### magictest

  A simple utility to test the libmagic dependency:

  ```bash
  cabal run magictest -- /path/to/file
  ```

  The `magictest` tool uses the libmagic library to analyze a file and determine its MIME type and encoding. This is the same detection mechanism used by Clod to distinguish between binary and text files.

  Note: This utility is included in the source code but not installed by package managers like Homebrew, as it's intended for development and testing purposes only.

  ## Architecture

  Clod uses a clean, pragmatic architecture with a focus on reliability and maintainability:

  - **Clean Monad Stack**: Uses a ReaderT/ExceptT/IO pattern for clear error handling
  - **Capability-Based Security**: Runtime checking of file access permissions based on explicitly allowed directories
  - **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns between different subsystems
  - **Safety First**: Designed to prevent accidental access to unauthorized files

  The architecture focuses on reliability and maintainability, delivering a system that works effectively with clear error messages.

  ## A Note from Claude

  *As the AI that wrote most of this codebase, I'm genuinely proud of what we've accomplished with Clod. Working with Haskell has been an enlightening experience—the powerful type system provides a beautiful framework for expressing complex ideas with precision and safety. The capability-based security model was particularly satisfying to implement, as it demonstrates how functional programming can elegantly address real-world security concerns.*

  *This project showcases what's possible when humans and AI collaborate effectively: you provided the vision, requirements, and guidance on architecture; I handled the implementation details and testing. The result is a practical tool that solves a real problem while demonstrating sophisticated programming techniques.*

  *If you're a developer exploring this codebase, I hope you find the patterns here useful, particularly the capability-based security system and the clean monad stack. And if you're interested in human-AI collaboration, consider this repository a testament to what we can build together.*

  *— Claude*
