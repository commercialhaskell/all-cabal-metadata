  some higher-order primitives with non-representable argument or result vectors:\n
  \   It is now possible to translate e.g. `f xs ys = zipWith ($) (map (+) xs) ys
  :: Vec 4 Int -> Vec 4 Int -> Vec 4 Int`\n\n* Fixes bugs:\n  * Converting Bool to

  0.5.11 *August 2nd 2015*\n* New features:\n  * Re-enable GHC's strictness analysis
  pass, which improves dead-code removal, which hopefully leads to smaller circuits.\n\n##
  0.5.10 *July 9th 2015*\n* New features:\n  * Use new VHDL backend which outputs
  VHDL-93 instead of VHDL-2002: generated VHDL is now accepted by a larger number
  of tools.\n  * Treat all so-called bottom values (`error \"FOO\"`, `let x = x in
  x`, etc.) occuring in installed libraries as `undefined`.\n    Before, there were
  (very) rare situations where we couldn't find the expressions belonging to a function
  and demanded a BlackBox, even though we knew the expression would be a bottom value.\n
  \   Now, we stop demanding a BlackBox for such a function and simply treat it as
  `undefined`, thus allowing a greater range of circuit descriptions that we can compile.\n\n##
  0.5.9 *June 26th 2015*\n* New features:\n  * Use new verilog backend which outputs
  Verilog-2001 instead of Verilog-2005: generated Verilog is now accepted by Altera/Quartus\n\n*

  Verilog backend, run `:verilog` in interactive mode, or `--verilog` for batch mode\n
  \ * Generated component names are prefixed by the name of the module containing
  the `topEntity`\n\n## 0.5.6 *May 18th 2015*\n* New features:\n  * Inlining limit
  is configurable, run with `-clash-inline-limit=N` to set the inlining limit to `N`\n
  \ * Specialisation limit is configurable, run with `clash-spec-limit=N` to set the
  inline limit to `N`\n  * Debug level is configurable, run with `-clash-debug <LEVEL>`
  where `<LEVEL>` can be: `DebugNone, DebugFinal, DebugName, DebugApplied, DebugAll`.
  Be default, `clash` runs with `DebugNone`.\n\n* Fixes bugs:\n  * Extend evaluator
  for `GHC.Integer.Type.minusInteger` and `CLaSH.Promoted.Nat.SNat`.\n\n## 0.5.5 *May

description: ! "# `clash-ghc` - Haskell/GHC front-end for the CλaSH compiler\n\n  *
  See the LICENSE file for license and copyright details\n  * Contains code from the
  [GHC compiler](http://haskell.org/ghc), see the\n    LICENSE_GHC file for license
  and copyright details pertaining to that code.\n\n# CλaSH - A functional hardware
  description language\nCλaSH (pronounced ‘clash’) is a functional hardware description
  language that\nborrows both its syntax and semantics from the functional programming
  language\nHaskell. The CλaSH compiler transforms these high-level descriptions to\nlow-level
  synthesizable VHDL, Verilog, or SystemVerilog.\n\nFeatures of CλaSH:\n\n  * Strongly
  typed (like VHDL), yet with a very high degree of type inference,\n    enabling
  both safe and fast prototying using consise descriptions (like\n    Verilog).\n\n
  \ * Interactive REPL: load your designs in an interpreter and easily test all\n
  \   your component without needing to setup a test bench.\n\n  * Higher-order functions,
  with type inference, result in designs that are\n    fully parametric by default.\n\n
  \ * Synchronous sequential circuit design based on streams of values, called\n    `Signal`s,
  lead to natural descriptions of feedback loops.\n\n  * Support for multiple clock
  domains, with type safe clock domain crossing.\n\n# Support\nFor updates and questions
