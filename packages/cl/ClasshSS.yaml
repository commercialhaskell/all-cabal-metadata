description: |-
  This package is a type-safe layer on top of Tailwind Classes
  to allow someone to treat the compiler like a lookup machine and ensure that no time will
  be wasted trying to fix typos in tailwind strings
  Originally this was meant to also provide a way to typify CSS but Tailwind provides such a nice
  abstraction on top of CSS and provides logical custom values that it made more sense to build
  entirely on top of Tailwind.
  It is not meant to be an exact 1 to 1 translation of Tailwind but rather an interface that
  aims to reduce the number of ways to do the same thing, in the effort to reduce spooky CSS behavior
