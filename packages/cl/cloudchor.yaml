  # CloudChor

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/cloudchor?style=for-the-badge)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cloudchor)

  CloudChor is a Haskell library for lighweight and efficient choreographic programming aimed at developing cloud services.
  It is an extension of the [HasChor](https://github.com/gshen42/HasChor) library.

  For more details, see the PEPM '26 paper: [Towards Lightweight and Efficient Choreographic Cloud Services](https://doi.org/10.1145/3779209.3779537).

  ## Repository structure

  * [`src/`](src/) contains the source code of the library.
    * [`Choreography.Location.Multi`](src/Choreography/Location/Multi.hs) is the module that implements multiply-located values.
  * [`examples/`](examples/) includes example programs using the library.
    * [`clean-room`](examples/clean-room/): An implementation of a data clean room protocol as a choreography.
    * [`unsoundness`](examples/unsoundness): Two counter-examples showing how unrestricted IO can lead to unsoundness.
    * [`HasChor`](examples/HasChor): The original examples from the HasChor repository.
  * [`benchmark/`](benchmark/) contains the setup for running benchmarks to compare `cond` vs. `cond_`.
