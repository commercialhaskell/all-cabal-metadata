  # `cleff-plugin`

  This GHC typechecking plugin disambiguates obvious usages of effects for the extensible effect framework `cleff`.

  ## Usage

  This plugin works with GHC 8.6 through 9.2 and `cleff >= 0.1 && < 0.4`. To use the plugin:

  1. Add this plugin as your package's dependency.
      - If you use `stack`, then you also need to add these lines your `stack.yaml`:
        ```yaml
        extra-deps:
        - cleff-plugin-0.1.0.0
        ```
  2. Enable the plugin by adding the following GHC option to your project file:
      ```
      ghc-options: -fplugin=Cleff.Plugin
      ```

  ## What it does

  When using `cleff`, the following code would not compile:

  ```haskell
  action :: '[State Int, State String] :>> es => Eff es ()
  action = do
    x <- get
    put (x + 1)
  -- • Could not deduce (Cleff.Internal.Rec.Elem (State s0) es)
  --     arising from a use of ‘get’
  ```

  This is because GHC is unable to determine which `State` effect we're trying to operate on, although the only viable choice is `State Int`. We had to write:

  ```haskell
  action :: '[State Int, State String] :>> es => Eff es ()
  action = do
    x <- get @Int
    put (x + 1)
  ```

  This is quite unwieldy. This plugin tells GHC extra information so code like this can typecheck without requiring manually annotating which effect to use.

  ## References

  This plugin's design is largely inspired by [`polysemy-plugin`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polysemy-plugin), which is in turn based on [`simple-effects`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/simple-effects).

  Refer to [`docs/plugin-spec.md`](https://github.com/re-xyr/cleff/tree/master/docs/plugin-spec.md) for details on the disambiguation algorithm this typecheck plugin uses.
