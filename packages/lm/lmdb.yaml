description: |-
  LMDB is a read-optimized Berkeley DB replacement developed by Symas
  for the OpenLDAP project. LMDB has impressive performance characteristics
  and a friendly BSD-style OpenLDAP license. See <http://symas.com/mdb/>.

  This library has Haskell bindings to the LMDB library. You must install
  the lmdb development files before installing this library,
  e.g. `sudo apt-get install liblmdb-dev` works for Ubuntu 14.04.

  For now, only a low level interface is provided, and the author is moving
  on to use LMDB rather than further develop its bindings. If a higher level
  API is desired, please consider contributing, or develop a separate package.
