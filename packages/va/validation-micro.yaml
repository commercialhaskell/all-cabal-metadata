description: "# validation-micro\n\n[![GitHub CI](https://github.com/ocramz/validation-micro/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ocramz/validation-micro/actions)\n\nLightweight
  pure data validation based on `Applicative` .\n\n`validation-micro` is built around
  the following data type:\n\n```haskell\ndata Validation e a\n    = Failure e\n    |
  Success a\n```\n\nThis data type is similar to `Either` but allows accumulating
  all\nerrors instead of short-circuiting on the first one.\n\n## Comparison with
  other packages\n\n`validation-micro` is not the only package that provides the `Validation`
  data type. \nHere are some differences and commonalities to other validation packages:\n\n+
  **Lightweight**. `validation-micro` depends only on `base` and\n  `deepseq`, which
  make it fast to build. \n  So adding validation capabilities to your\n  library
  or application doesn't contribute much to your dependency\n  footprint.\n+ **Future-proof**.
  Both `base` and `deepseq` are GHC boot packages, which means that `validation-micro`
  can be imported as long as GHC can run.\n+ **No Selective instance**. This means
  you cannot choose which validation to use based on the value. On the other hand,
  we don't need to depend on `selective` which is a somewhat experimental package.\n+
  **No Monad instance** - but there is a `bindValidation` utility function which behaves
  like `(>>=)`.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright:  (c) 2014 Chris Allen, Edward Kmett\n
