synopsis: A Valve Value-keyvalue parser for Haskell made with Parsec.
changelog: "# Revision history for ValveValueKeyvalue\r\n\r\n## 1.0.0.0 -- 2021-09-27\r\n\r\n*
  First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\r\n\r\n## 1.0.1.0 -- 2021-09-28\r\n\r\n*
  Added parseToVKV function and added some documentation\r\n\r\n## 1.1.0.0 -- yyyy-mm-dd\r\n\r\n*
  Changed class to use Either\r\n* Updated documentation\r\n* Changed export order
  so haddock makes better documentation\r\n* Added tested-with in cabal file\r\n*
  Changed list instance of ValveVKV to always return Right. In case no items are found,
  return Right []. To get a list that is certain to not be empty, use NonEmpty from
  the Data.List.NonEmpty module in base\r\n* Fixed example in readme"

description: "# ValveValueKeyvalue\r\nA Haskell parser for Valve's value-keyvalue
  format. The main function is \"parseValveVKV\" in the module Text.ValveVKV. You
  can see it only parses to types that are part of the typeclass ValveVKV. For example,
  if you have this type:\r\n` data My = My {name :: String, count :: Int} `\r\nThen
  the instance looks like this:\r\n```\r\ninstance ValveVKV My where\r\n    fromValveVKV
  this _ =\r\n        My <$> this ^: \"name\" <*> this .: \"count\"\r\n```\r\nThe
  first parameter is the entry that should be turned into your type, and the 2nd one
  is the parent of that entry. The ^: operator receives an entry on the left side
  and a string on the right side. It tries to find the string subentry named the string
  inside the entry you gave in on the left. The .: operator is similar, but can return
  any type, not just string.\r\n\r\nThe entry type ValveKeyValueEntry has 3 constructors.
  KVObject, which has a Pair of a KeyValueEntry list. KVInt, which has a Pair of Int
  and KVString, which has a pair of string. The Pair type itself is one constructor
  of a string and the type parameter.\r\n\r\nSo you can now run\r\n```\r\na :: IO
  (Either String My)\r\na = do\r\n    contents <- readFile \"file.txt\"\r\n    return
  $ parseValveVKV contents\r\n```\r\nThis will open file \"file.txt\", read its contents
  and return the \"My\" type.\r\n\r\nAvaliable on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ValveValueKeyvalue)"
