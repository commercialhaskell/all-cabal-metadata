description: "# ValveValueKeyvalue\r\nA Haskell parser for Valve's value-keyvalue
  format. The main function is \"parseValveVKV\" in the module Text.ValveVKV. You
  can see it only parses to types that are part of the typeclass ValveVKV. For example,
  if you have this type:\r\n` data My = My {name :: String, count :: Int} `\r\nThen
  the instance looks like this:\r\n```\r\ninstance ValveVKV My where\r\n    fromValveVKV
  this _ =\r\n        My <$> this ^: \"name\" <*> this .: \"count\"\r\n```\r\nThe
  first parameter is the entry that should be turned into your type, and the 2nd one
  is the parent of that entry. The ^: operator receives an entry on the left side
  and a string on the right side. It tries to find the string subentry named the string
  inside the entry you gave in on the left. The .: operator is similar, but can return
  any type, not just string.\r\n\r\nThe entry type ValveKeyValueEntry has 3 constructors.
  KVObject, which has a Pair of a KeyValueEntry list. KVInt, which has a Pair of Int
  and KVString, which has a pair of string. The Pair type itself is one constructor
  of a string and the type parameter.\r\n\r\nSo you can now run\r\n```\r\na :: IO
  My\r\na = do\r\n    contents <- readFile \"file.txt\"\r\n    return $ parseValveVKV
  contents\r\n```\r\nThis will open file \"file.txt\", read its contents and return
  the \"My\" type."
