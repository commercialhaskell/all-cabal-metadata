  Lightweight pure data validation based on `Applicative` and `Selective` functors.

  `validation-selective` is built around the following data type:

  ```haskell
  data Validation e a
      = Failure e
      | Success a
  ```

  This data type is similar to `Either` but allows accumulating all
  errors instead of short-circuiting on the first one.

  For more examples and library tutorial, refer to Haddock:

  * [`validation`: Official documentation](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/validation-selective/docs/Validation.html)

  ## Comparison with other packages

  `validation-selective` is not the only package that provides such
  `Validation` data type. However, unlike other packages, it has some
  noticeable advantages:

  + **Lightweight**. `validation-selective` depends only on `base` and
    `selective` (which is tiny) Haskell libraries which make this
    package fast to build. So adding validation capabilities to your
    library or application doesn't contribute much to your dependency
    footprint.
  + **Selective instance.** `validation-selective` is the only package
    that provides `Selective` instance for `Validation` which allows
    using `Monad`-like branching behaviour but without implementing
    wrong `Monad` instance.
  + **More algebraic instances.** `validation-selective` also provides
    the `Alternative` instance and a more general `Semigroup` instance.
  + **Best-in-class documentation.** Official Haddock documentation
    contains mini-tutorial, usage example, per-component comparison with
    `Either`, the motivation behind each instance and the interface in
    general along with examples for **each instance and function**.

  The below section provides per-package comparison with the most
  popular validation packages in the Haskell ecosystem:

  + [`either`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/either): `Validation`
    implementation by Edward Kmett. This package is more heavyweight,
    since it depends on more Haskell libraries like `profunctors`,
    `bifunctors`, `semigroupoids`. But it also provides prisms for
    `Validation` and some combinators for `Either`.
  + [`validation`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/validation):
    `Validation` from [Queensland Functional Programming Lab](https://qfpl.io/).
    Depends on `lens`, which makes it even heavier but also have richer
    interface compared to the `either` package.

  ## How to use

  `validation-selective` is compatible with the latest GHC compiler
  versions starting from `8.4.4`.

  In order to start using `validation-selective` in your project, you
  will need to set it up with the three easy steps:

  1. Add the dependency on `validation-selective` in your project's
     `.cabal` file. For this, you should modify the `build-depends`
     section by adding the name of this library. After the adjustment,
     this section could look like this:

     ```haskell
     build-depends: base ^>= 4.14
                  , validation-selective ^>= 0.0
     ```
  2. In the module where you wish to implement pure data validation, you
     should add the import:

     ```haskell
     import Validation (Validation (..))
     ```
  3. Now you can use the types and functions from the library:

     ```haskell
     main :: IO ()
     main = print [Failure "wrong", Success 42]
     ```

  ### Usage with Stack

  If `validation-selective` is not available on your current Stackage
  resolver yet, fear not! You can still use it from Hackage by adding
  the following to the `extra-deps` section of your `stack.yaml` file:

  ```yaml
  extra-deps:
    - validation-selective-CURRENT_VERSION
  ```
