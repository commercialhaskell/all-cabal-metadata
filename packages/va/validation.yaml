  Several data-types like Either but with differing properties and type-class

  instances.


  Library support is provided for those different representations, include

  `lens`-related functions for converting between each and abstracting over their

  similarities.


  * `AccValidation`


  The `AccValidation` data type is isomorphic to `Either`, but has an instance

  of `Applicative` that accumulates on the error side. That is to say, if two

  (or more) errors are encountered, they are appended using a `Semigroup`

  operation.


  As a consequence of this `Applicative` instance, there is no corresponding

  `Bind` or `Monad` instance. `AccValidation` is an example of, "An applicative

  functor that is not a monad."


  * `Validation`


  The `Validation` data type is isomorphic to `Either` and has a `Monad`

  instance that does the same as `Either`. The only difference to `Either` is

  the constructor names and surrounding library support.


  * `ValidationT`


  The `ValidationT` data type is the monad transformer for `Validation`. An

  instance of `MonadTrans` is provided for `(ValidationT err)`. Due to the

  arrangement of the `ValidationT` type constructor, which permits a `MonadTrans

  instance, there is no possible `Bifunctor` instance. Consequently, the

  `ValidationB` data type provides a `Bifunctor` instance (but not a

  `MonadTrans` instance). Library support is provided to exploit the isomorphism

  to `ValidationB`.


  Note that since `AccValidation` is not a monad, there is also no corresponding

  monad transformer for this data type.


  * `ValidationB`


  The `ValidationB` data type is similar to the monad transformer for

  `Validation` (`ValidationT`), however, due to the arrangement of the

  `ValidationB` type constructor, which permits a `Bifunctor` instance, there is

  no possible `MonadTrans` instance. Consequently, the `ValidationT` data type

  provides a `MonadTrans` instance (but not a `Bifunctor` instance). Library

  support is provided to exploit the isomorphism to `ValidationT`.


  * `Validation''`


  The `Validation'' err a` type-alias is equivalent to

  `ValidationT err Identity a` and so is isomorphic to `Either` and others.

  Libraries are supplied accordingly.'
