  # ⛨ Valor

  [![Test & Publish](https://github.com/mastarija/valor/actions/workflows/tst-pub.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mastarija/valor/actions/workflows/tst-pub.yaml)

  Simple and powerful data validation library with Applicative and Monad
  interface. Great for constructing structured errors.

  The new version has changed considerably and now it has much simpler API and a
  lot more of useful, to the point examples throughout the documentation. You can
  consider it "mature" at this point.
