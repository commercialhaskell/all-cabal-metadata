  # Vacuum: visualising the GHC heap

  Vacuum is a library for extracting graph representations of values
  from the GHC heap, at runtime. Those graphs may then be further
  processed or translated to various representations for visualization
  -- like Graphviz, or Ubigraph.

  [travis-ci.org](http://travis-ci.org) results: [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/thoughtpolice/vacuum.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/thoughtpolice/vacuum)

  [Homepage][main page].

  # Installation

  It's just a `cabal install` away on [Hackage][]:

  ```bash
  $ cabal install vacuum
  # also install the graphviz package, for SVG/PNG rendering:
  $ cabal install vacuum-graphviz
  ```

  # Gallery of examples

  Want to try before you buy, and see what Vacuum output looks like?
  Here are some examples:

   * Vacuuming the linked list `[1, 2]` - [Results][e1]

  More examples will come in the future.
