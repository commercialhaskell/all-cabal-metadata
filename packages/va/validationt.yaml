  # ValidationT

  A simple data validation library. The main idea is to provide an easy way to
  validate web form data by aggregating errors for each field.

  ## Usage

  Suppose you want to validate some data from the user. Say, that the password adheres to some rules.

  You might do something like this:

  ```haskell
  validatePassword :: Monad m => String -> ValidationT [String] m ()
  validatePassword password = do
    vLength password
    vAlpha password
    vNum password
    where
      vLength p = when (length p < 8)
        $ vWarning ["The password should be at least 8 characters long."]
      vAlpha p = unless (any isAlpha p)
        $ vWarning ["The password should contain at least one alphabetic character."]
      vNum p = unless (any isDigit p)
        $ vWarning ["The password should contain at least one numeric character."]
  ```

  `ValidationT e m a` essentially just gathers the errors thrown by `vWarning`.

  ```haskell
  vWarning :: (Monad m, Monoid e) => e -> ValidationT e m ()
  ```

  `vWarning` `mappend`s the given `e` to the already collected errors. This is why the warnings are contained inside a list.

  There is also `vError`. The only difference between `vWarning` and `vError` is that `vError` stops further execution (and further collection of errors and warnings).

  You would use the validation like this:

  ```haskell
  main :: IO ()
  main = do
    password <- getLine
    result <- runValidationTEither . validatePassword $ password
    putStrLn $ case result of
      Left errs -> unlines err
      Right () -> "You are fine."
  ```

  You could, of course, do more complicated things like use `vWarningL` and `vErrorL` to add an error to a `mempty` structure, which gets `mappend`ed with other errors.

  The library comes with a `MonoidMap` `newtype` wrapper around `Map`, which `mappend`s the values themselves on conflict. This can be useful if you have a multiple points of failure and you want to distinguich between them -- validating a username and a password for example:

  ```haskell
  data Piece
    = Password
    | UserName
    deriving (Eq, Show, Ord)

  validatePassword :: Monad m => String -> ValidationT (MonoidMap Piece [String]) m ()
  validatePassword password = do
    vLength password
    vAlpha password
    vNum password
    where
      warning = mmSingleton UserName
      vLength p = when (length p < 8)
        $ warning ["The password should be at least 8 characters long."]
      vAlpha p = unless (any isAlpha p)
        $ warning ["The password should contain at least one alphabetic character."]
      vNum p = unless (any isDigit p)
        $ warning ["The password should contain at least one numeric character."]
  ```

  (`mmSingleton` is a covenience initializer for `MonoidMap`.)
