  To disallow invalid input it is common to define (new)types with hidden data
  constructors. Forcing the user to go through a smart-constructor that enforces
  invariants and returns `Maybe ResultType`, preventing the construction of data
  with invalid values.

  However, it is __also__ common to want to include literal values of such types
  in source text. Things of textual literals for HTML, HTTP, etc. In such cases
  smart-constructors force us to handle potential conversion failures at runtime,
  or abusing functions like `fromJust` to break away all the safety
  smart-constructors provide. All this despite the fact that we can statically
  know at compile time that the conversion will always succeed or always fails.

  This package provides a typeclasses for using TH to validate the correctness of
  provided literals at compile. This lets you define, e.g., `newtype Even = Even
  Integer` and write:

  ```
  x :: Even
  x = $$(valid 38)
  ```

  This will check, at compile time, that the provided `Integer` is, in fact, even
  and unwrap it from `Maybe`, avoiding the runtime check.
