  * Changelog

  ** 0.14

  - Got rid of proxies to build planar graphs, use TypeApplication
    instead. Also slightly changed some of the types to better reflect
    what they need; in particular 'buildGraph' now takes only the
    adjacency lists (no face information). And 'fromAdjRep' which
    computes a PlanarGraph from its adjacencylists (including vertex and
    edge info.)
  - Cleaning up the public API by hiding several internal modules.

  ** 0.13

  - Moved 'intersects' from the HasIntersectionWith class into a new
    class IsIntersectableWith. This allows separate (weaker) constraints
    for checking *if* geometries intersect rather than computing exact
    intersections.
  - Bug fixes in the orientations of boundaries in PlanarGraph.
  - Implementation of Logaritmic Method, wich allows us to transform a
    static data structure into an insertion only data structure

  ** 0.12

  - Add Data.Double.Approximate: Floating point numbers take take
    imprecision into account when ordering.
  - Add Data.Double.Shaman: Floating point numbers that keep track of
    error bounds while not being more than an order of magnitude slower
    than native floating point numbers.
  - Add Data.PlanarGraph.Immutable and Data.PlanarGraph.Mutable: New
    planargraph implementation that supports efficient updates and queries.

  ** 0.11

  - Changed the implementation of Two and Three in Data.Util
    (hgeometry-combinatorial). Now they have proper Functor, Foldable,
    and Traversable instances.
  - Added Data.RealNumber.Rational wrapping the Rational type giving
    some more readable show/read instances
  - Added function to compute levels in a Rose-Tree
  - Moved the binary searching functions from Data.Sequence.Util into
    Algorithms.BinarySearch, also added a version for fractional types
    that stops at a given threshold.
  - Removed Data.BalBST and Data.SlowSeq
  - Moved Measured from Data.BinaryTree into a separate module.

  ** 0.10

  - More Instances

  ** 0.9

  - First release in which hgeometry-combinatorial was split off from hgeometry.
