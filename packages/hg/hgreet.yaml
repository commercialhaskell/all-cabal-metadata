  # HGreet
  ## Haskell package to interact with the greetd daemon trough it's IPC protocol.
  This package provides a module to interact with the greetd daemon trough it's IPC protocol.

  It is intended as a simple abstraction layer for the IPC protocol, and is NOT a greeter in and of itself.

  For an example of a working greeter based on this, see [hgreet-example](https://github.com/Vawlpe/hgreet/tree/main/hgreet-example).
