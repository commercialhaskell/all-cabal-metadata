changelog: ! "#### 0.7 ###\n\n- Compatibility with GHC 8.0-8.4\n- Implemented more
  Algorithms and Data Structures. This includes\n  * Polygon triangulation\n- A new
  implementation of PlanarSubdivision that now also supports disconnected\n  subdivsions.\n-
  Performance improvements by changing to a different Vector\n  implementation. For
  low dimensional vectors (of dimension at most four) we\n  now essentially use the
  types from\n  [linear](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/linear), this gives significant\n
  \ speedups on several small benchmarks.\n- bugfixes.\n\n#### 0.6 ###\n\n- Implemented
  more Algorithms and Data Structures. This includes\n  * Bentley-Ottmannn line-segment
  intersection,\n  * Well-Separated Pair decompositions,\n  * extremal point/tangents
  for Convex hulls,\n  * Minkowski sum for convex polygons,\n  * one dimensional segment
  trees,\n  * one dimensional interval trees, and a\n  * KD-tree.\n- Several bug fixes,
  including a very stupid bug in Box\n- Separate ConvexPolygon type.\n- More thorough
  testing for some of the algorithms.\n- Started work on a proper representation for
  planar subdivsions. This includes\n  a representation of planar graphs that support
  querying if two vertices are\n  connected by an edge in $O(1)$ time.\n- Dropped
  support for GHC 7.8\n\n#### 0.5 ###\n\n- Implemented several algorithms, including
  Delaunay Triangulation, EMST, and\nDouglas Peucker.\n- Revamped the data types for
  Intersections\n\n#### 0.4 ###\n\n- Major rewrite from scratch, providing much stronger
  type-level\n  guarantees. Incompatible with older versions.\n- Convex Hull and Smallest
  enclosing disk algorithms.\n- HGeometry now includes some very experimental and
  preliminary support for\n  reading and writing Ipe7 files.\n\n#### 0.2 & 0.3 ###\n\n-
  Internal releases.\n\n### 0.1.1 ###\n\n- Fixed a bug in point on n the line segment
  test\n- Generalized the types of inCircle, inDisc, onCircle, onDisc etc. We now
  need\n  only that the type representing precision model implements the typeclass\n
  \ `Num` instead of `Floating'.\n\n### 0.1 ###\n\n- Initial release.\n"

description: ! "HGeometry\n=========\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/noinia/hgeometry.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/noinia/hgeometry)\n[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/hgeometry.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hgeometry)\n\nHGeometry
  provides some basic geometry types, and geometric algorithms and data\nstructures
  for them. The main two focusses are: (1) Strong type safety, and (2)\nimplementations
  of geometric algorithms and data structures with good\nasymptotic running time guarantees.
  Design choices showing these aspects are\nfor example:\n\n- we provide a data type
  `Point d r` parameterized by a\ntype-level natural number `d`, representing d-dimensional
  points (in all cases\nour type parameter `r` represents the (numeric) type for the
  (real)-numbers):\n\n```haskell\nnewtype Point (d :: Nat) (r :: *) = Point { toVec
  :: Vector d r }\n```\n- the vertices of a `PolyLine d p r` are stored in a `Data.Seq2`
  which enforces\nthat a polyline is a proper polyline, and thus has at least two
  vertices.\n\nPlease note that aspect (2), implementing good algorithms, is much
  work in\nprogress. Only a few algorithms have been implemented, some of which could
  use\nsome improvements. Currently, HGeometry provides the following algorithms:\n\n*
  two \\(O(n \\log n)\\) time algorithms for convex hull in\n  $\\mathbb{R}^2$: the
  typical Graham scan, and a divide and conqueror algorithm,\n* an \\(O(n)\\) expected
  time algorithm for smallest enclosing disk in $\\mathbb{R}^$2,\n* the well-known
  Douglas Peucker polyline line simplification algorithm,\n* an \\(O(n \\log n)\\)
  time algorithm for computing the Delaunay triangulation\n(using divide and conqueror).\n*
  an \\(O(n \\log n)\\) time algorithm for computing the Euclidean Minimum Spanning\nTree
  (EMST), based on computing the Delaunay Triangulation.\n* an \\(O(\\log^2 n)\\)
  time algorithm to find extremal points and tangents on/to a\n  convex polygon.\n*
  An optimal \\(O(n+m)\\) time algorithm to compute the Minkowski sum of two convex\npolygons.\n*
  An \\(O(1/\\varepsilon^dn\\log n)\\) time algorithm for constructing a Well-Separated
  pair\n  decomposition.\n\nIt also has some geometric data structures. In particular,
  HGeometry contans an\nimplementation of\n\n* A one dimensional Segment Tree. The
  base tree is static.\n* A one dimensional Interval Tree. The base tree is static.\n*
  A KD-Tree. The base tree is static.\n\nHGeometry also includes a datastructure/data
  type for planar graphs. In\nparticular, it has a `EdgeOracle` data structure, that
  can be built in \\(O(n)\\)\ntime that can test if the graph contains an edge in
  constant time.\n\nNumeric Types\n-------------\n\nAll geometry types are parameterized
  by a numerical type `r`. It is well known\nthat Floating-point arithmetic and Geometric
  algorithms don't go well together;\ni.e. because of floating point errors one may
  get completely wrong\nresults. Hence, I *strongly* advise against using `Double`
  or `Float` for these\ntypes. In several algorithms it is sufficient if the type
  `r` is\n`Fractional`. Hence, you can use an exact number type such as `Rational`.\n\nA
  Note on the Ext (:+) data type\n---------------------------------\n\nIn many applications
  we do not just have geometric data, e.g. `Point d r`s or\n`Polygon r`s, but instead,
  these types have some additional properties, like a\ncolor, size, thickness, elevation,
  or whatever. Hence, we would like that our\nlibrary provides functions that also
  allow us to work with `ColoredPolygon r`s\netc. The typical Haskell approach would
  be to construct type-classes such as\n`PolygonLike` and define functions that work
  with any type that is\n`PolygonLike`. However, geometric algorithms are often hard
  enough by\nthemselves, and thus we would like all the help that the type-system/compiler\ncan
  give us. Hence, we choose to work with concrete types.\n\nTo still allow for some
  extensibility our types will use the Ext (:+) type. For\nexample, our `Polygon`
  data type, has an extra type parameter `p` that allows\nthe vertices of the polygon
  to cary some extra information of type `p` (for\nexample a color, a size, or whatever).\n\n```haskell\ndata
  Polygon (t :: PolygonType) p r where\n  SimplePolygon :: C.CSeq (Point 2 r :+ p)
  \                        -> Polygon Simple p r\n  MultiPolygon  :: C.CSeq (Point
  2 r :+ p) -> [Polygon Simple p r] -> Polygon Multi  p r\n```\n\nIn all places this
  extra data is accessable by the (:+) type in Data.Ext, which\nis essentially just
  a pair.\n\nReading and Writing Ipe files\n-----------------------------\n\nApart
  from geometric types, HGeometry provides some interface for reading and\nwriting
  Ipe (http://ipe.otfried.org). However, this is all very work in\nprogress. Hence,
  the API is experimental and may change at any time! Here is an\nexample showing
  reading a set of points from an Ipe file, computing the\nDelaunayTriangulation,
  and writing the result again to an output file\n\n```haskell\nmainWith                          ::
  Options -> IO ()\nmainWith (Options inFile outFile) = do\n    ePage <- readSinglePageFile
  inFile\n    case ePage of\n      Left err                         -> print err\n
  \     Right (page :: IpePage Rational) -> case page^..content.traverse._IpeUse of\n
  \       []         -> putStrLn \"No points found\"\n        syms@(_:_) -> do\n           let
  pts  = syms&traverse.core %~ (^.symbolPoint)\n               pts' = NonEmpty.fromList
  pts\n               dt   = delaunayTriangulation $ pts'\n               out  = [asIpe
  drawTriangulation dt]\n           writeIpeFile outFile . singlePageFromContent $
  out\n```\n\nSee the examples directory for more examples.\n"
