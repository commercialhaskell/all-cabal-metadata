description: |-
  HGamer3D is a toolset for developing 3D games in the programming
  language Haskell. This package provides the SDL2 binding.
  HGamer3D-SDL2-Binding is available on Windows and Linux.
  This binding does not claim to have full coverage of SDL2
  functionality, but only to support what is needed for the
  HGamer3D-WinEvent package.
