synopsis: Support for serialising Haskell to and from JSON
changelog: "Version 0.9.1\n  * Merge-in contributions from Neil Mitchell to support
  GHC 7.10\n\nVersion 0.9\n  * Merge-in contributions from Neil Mitchell to accomodate
  working with HEAD.\n\nVersion 0.8\n  * Add `Applicative` instance for `GetJSON`\n\nVersion
  0.4.4: released 2009-01-17; changes from 0.4.2\n\n  * Fixes handling of unterminated
  strings.\n\nVersion 0.4.3: released 2009-01-17; changes from 0.4.2\n\n  * optimize
  some common cases..string and int literals.\n    Reduces parse times by > 2x on
  larger dict inputs containing\n    both kinds of lits.\n\nVersion 0.4.2: released
  2009-01-17; changes from 0.4.1\n\n  * fixed Cabal build issues with various versions
  of 'base' and Data.Generic\n  * fixed whitespace-handling bug in Parsec-based frontend.\n\nVersion
  0.4.1: released 2009-01-12; changes from 0.3.6\n\n  * Addition of extra JSON instances:\n
  \      - IntMap, Set, Array, IntSet\n       \n  * Dropped initial letter case-lowering
  for constructors: \n       - Maybe's constructors are mapped to \"Nothing\",\"Just\".\n
  \      - Either's constructors are mapped to \"Left\", \"Right\".\n\n  * Ordering's
  are represented by their constructor names (was\n    funky int-mapping.)\n\n  *
  JSON.Text.Result is now an instance of MonadError; contributed\n    by Andy Gimblett.\n\n
  \ * Included Lennart Augustsson's contributed generic JSON encoder,\n    in Text.JSON.Generic\n\n
  \ * Optional JSON dict-mapping for Data.Map and Data.IntMap\n\n"

description: |-
  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange
  format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for
  machines to parse and generate.  It is based on a subset of the
  JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition -
  December 1999.

  This library provides a parser and pretty printer for converting
  between Haskell values and JSON.
