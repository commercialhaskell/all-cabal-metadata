  ## Unreleased

  ## 1.3.0.0

  ### JsonEither now takes a type-level list

  `JsonEither` now accepts a type-level list of specs (`JsonEither '[a, b, c]`)
  instead of two arguments (`JsonEither a b`), so sum types with many branches
  no longer require a binary tree of nested `JsonEither`s. The structural type
  for `JsonEither` is nested `Either`: two or more branches map to
  `Either (JStruct env a) (Either (JStruct env b) ...)`; a single branch maps
  to `JStruct env spec` (no sum wrapper). Use `Left`/`Right` for construction
  and pattern matching.

  #### Migration guide

  **Specs (example: four alternatives)**

  Before:

  ```
  JsonEither (JsonEither (JsonEither specA specB) specC) specD
  ```

  After:

  ```
  JsonEither '[specA, specB, specC, specD]
  ```

  **Patterns/construction**

  **Note:** The only difference in the pattern/construction may be how
  the `Either`s are nested. The two examples below represent the same
  four alternatives with different `Left`/`Right` nesting; the JSON and
  types are equivalent.

  Before (four branches):

  ```
  Left (Left (Left val))
  Left (Left (Right val))
  Left (Right val)
  Right val
  ```

  After (same nesting with `Left`/`Right`; one branch = no wrapper):

  ```
  Left val
  Right (Left val)
  Right (Right (Left val))
  Right (Right (Right val))
  ```

  ## Motivation

  The primary motivation is to allow you to avoid Aeson Generic instances
  while still getting the possibility of auto-generated (and therefore
  /correct/) documentation and code in your servant APIs.

  Historically, the trade-off has been:

  1. Use Generic instances, and therefore your API is brittle. Changes
     to a deeply nested object might unexpectedly change (and break) your
     API. You must structure your Haskell types exactly as they are
     rendered into JSON, which may not always be "natural" and easy to
     work with. In exchange, you get the ability to auto-derive matching
     ToSchema instances along with various code generation tools that
     all understand Aeson Generic instances.

  2. Hand-write your ToJSON and FromJSON instances, which means you
     get to structure your Haskell types in the way that works best
     for Haskell, while structuring your JSON in the way that works
     best for your API. It also means you can more easily support "old"
     decoding versions and more easily maintain backwards compatibility,
     etc. In exchange, you have to to hand-write your ToSchema instances,
     and code generation is basically out.

  The goal of this library is to provide a way to hand-write the encoding
  and decoding of your JSON using type-level 'Specification's, while
  still allowing the use of tools that can interpret the specification
  and auto-generate ToSchema instances and code.

  The tooling ecosystem that knows how to interpret 'Specification's
  is still pretty new, but it at least includes OpenApi compatibility
  (i.e. ToSchema instances) and Elm code generation.

  ## Example

  ```haskell
  data User = User
    { name :: Text
    , lastLogin :: UTCTime
    }
    deriving stock (Show, Eq)
    deriving (ToJSON, FromJSON) via (SpecJSON User)
  instance HasJsonEncodingSpec User where
    type EncodingSpec User =
      JsonObject '[
        Required "name" JsonString,
        Required "last-login" JsonDateTime
      ]
    toJSONStructure user =
      (Field @"name" (name user),
      (Field @"last-login" (lastLogin user),
      ()))
  instance HasJsonDecodingSpec User where
    type DecodingSpec User = EncodingSpec User
    fromJSONStructure
        (Field @"name" name,
        (Field @"last-login" lastLogin,
        ()))
      =
        pure User { name , lastLogin }
  ```
