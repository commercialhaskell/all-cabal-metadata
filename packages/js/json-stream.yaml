changelog: ! '# 0.4.2.4


  Fix compiling with new ghc.


  # 0.4.2.3


  Fix 32-bit number parsing.


  # 0.4.2.2


  Speed optimization of `many` and aeson object.


  # 0.4.2.0

  Added Semigroup instance, compatibility with base-4.11


  # 0.4.1.5

  Renamed `_js_decode_string` function to avoid conflict with `aeson`.


  # 0.4.1.4

  Added support for GHC 8.2.


  # 0.4.1.3

  Fix windows build.


  # 0.4.1.2

  Slightly more strictness in arrayOf.

  Fixed memory leak in arrayOf.


  # 0.4.1.0

  Added aeson-compatibile encode/decode functions.


  # 0.4.0.0

  Breaking changes (this could *really* break your code):

  - Changed `<|>` to `<>` (`Monoid` is better for ''appending'' than `Alternative`)

  - Changed `>^>` to `<|>` - (`Alternative` now really means alternative)

  - Changed `toList` to `many` (Use existing `Alternative` function instead of a custom
  one)

  - Added `some` function (Alternative, default implementation won''t work)

  - C-lexer now supports parsing numbers up to 18 digits (E-notation is not optimized
  yet)


  # 0.3.2.3

  - Completely rewritten text unescapes based on text decodeUtf8; fixes some surprising
  crashes, speed improvements.


  # 0.3.2.0

  - Changed string parsing; parsing of escaped strings is now very fast

  - Removed bytestring parser


  # 0.3.0.4

  - Fixed bug in safestring

  - Fixed test so it doesn''t depend on versions of other packages

  - Added sax-like parsers


  # 0.3.0.3

  - Fixed wrong size of C structure in FFI that was causing a segfault.

description: ! "# json-stream - Applicative incremental JSON parser for Haskell\n\n[![Build
  Status](https://travis-ci.org/ondrap/json-stream.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ondrap/json-stream)
  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/json-stream.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/json-stream)\n\n#
  When to use this library\n\n- use [aeson](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson)
  if you can; compile aeson with `cffi` flag if you need better performance\n- use
  `json-stream` if you\n  - need streaming\n  - need every bit of performance (do
  profile; aeson is quite fast these days)\n  - do not care that parsing may not fail
  on malformed JSON data\n  - do not need advanced error reporting; json-stream tends
  to skip data that\n    doesn't fit parsing rules (this might be implemented better
  in the future)\n\n# Intro\n\nMost haskellers use the excellent [aeson](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson)
  library\nto decode and encode JSON structures. Unfortunately, although very fast,
  this parser\nmust read the whole structure into memory. Json-stream allows incremental
  parsing.\n\n> Parsing performance is generally better than aeson, sometimes significantly
  better.\n> Json-stream uses a small and fast C lexer to parse the JSON into tokens.
  This results\n> in quite significant performance gain. Ideal scenario is parsing
  large files\n> where not all information is required; json-stream parses only what
  is really needed.\n\nStandard aeson library reads the whole input, creates an object
  in memory representing\nthe JSON structure which is then converted into proper values
  using FromJSON instances.\nThis library is compatible with aeson - you can immediately
  use FromJSON instances almost without\nany change in code and enjoy incremental
  parsing. The real strength is in the applicative interface\nwhich allows to parse
  only those parts of JSON that are of interest while skipping what is not needed.\n\nThe
  parsing process uses the least amount of memory possible and is completely lazy.
  It does not perfectly\ncheck for JSON syntax and the behaviour on incorrect JSON
  input is undefined (it cheats quite a lot;\nbut this is needed for constant-space
  parsing). **The result on badly formed input is undefined,\nthe parser does not
  guarantee failing on bad input.**\n\n- The parser generally does not fail. If the
  data does not match, the parser silently ignores it.\n  The failures should be only
  syntax errors in JSON.\n- The ',' and ':' characters in the lexer are treated as
  white-space.\n- When a value is not needed to be parsed, it is parsed by a parser
  counting braces and brackets.\n  Anything can happen, the parser just waits for
  the sum of openings to equal sum of closings.\n- The length of an object key is
  limited to ~64K, records with longer keys are ignored.\n\n## Motivation\n\nResult
  of ElasticSearch bulk operations is a large JSON with this structure:\n```json\n{\n
  \ \"took\":42,\n  \"errors\":true,\n  \"items\": [\n    {\"index\": {\"_index\":\"test\",\"_type\":\"type1\",\"_id\":\"3\",\"status\":400,\"error\":\"Some
  error \"}},\n    {\"index\":{\"_index\":\"test\",\"_type\":\"type1\",\"_id\":\"4\",\"_version\":2,\"status\":200}}\n
  \ ]\n}\n```\n\nWe want the parser to return an empty list immediately when it encounters
  the *errors* key\nand the value is *false*. If the value is *true*, we want the
  parser to return a list of\n`_id` keys with an error status.\n\n\n```haskell\n--
  | Result of bulk operation\nresultParser :: Parser [(Text, Text)]\nresultParser
  =    const [] <$> filterI not (\"errors\" .: bool)\n              <|> many (\"items\"
  .: arrayOf bulkItemError)\n\nbulkItemError :: Parser (Text, Text)\nbulkItemError
  = objectWithKey \"index\" $\n    (,) <$> \"_id\"   .: string\n        <*> \"error\"
  .: string\n        <*  filterI statusError (\"status\" .: integer)\n  where\n    statusError
  s = s < 200 || s > (299 :: Int)\n\n```\n## Performance\n\nThe crude lexing is done
  by a C-optimized code in batches, the\nlexed pieces are then parsed using the user-specified
  parser. Json-stream\nis generally slightly faster than aeson. It is significantly
  faster\nin the following scenarios:\n\n- parsing numbers\n- parsing strings when
  aeson is not compiled with `cffi` flag\n  (the `cffi` flag of aeson enables fast
  text decoding borrowed from json-stream)\n- parsing only subset of big JSON structures\n\nJson-stream
  is in streaming mode is also much friendlier to the GC.\n\nUsing json-stream parser
  instead of aeson `value` evades the need to build the structure\nusing aeson `Value`
  and then converting it to the user-requested structure. Instead\nthe structure is
  built on the fly directly during the parsing phase.\n\nJson-stream can optimize
  certain scenarios. If not all data from the input stream is\nrequired, it is skipped
  by the parsers.\n\n## Constant space parsing\n\nIf the matching parser follows certain
  rules and the input chunks have limited size,\nthe parsing should run in constant
  space. If you have a large JSON structure but need\nonly small pieces, the parsing
  can be very fast - when the data does not match what\nis expected, it is parsed
  only by the lexical parser and ignored. The object key\nlength is limited to 64K,
  maximum length of a string can be limited with `safeString`\nparser. The number
  of digits in a number is limited to 200.000, longer number will\nmake the parser
  fail.\n\n## Examples\n\n```haskell\n-- The parseByteString function always returns
  a list of 'things'.\n-- Other functions are available.\n>>> :t parseByteString\nparseByteString
  :: Parser a -> ByteString -> [a]\n\n-- 'value' stands for FromJSON instance that
  will be yielded;\n-- most normal types work by default\n>>> parseByteString value
  \"[1,2,3]\" :: [[Int]]\n[[1,2,3]]\n\n-- the parser says we have an 'array of values';
  i.e. return each value in array\n>>> parseByteString (arrayOf value) \"[1,2,3]\"
  :: [Int]\n[1,2,3]\n\n-- Use <*> for parallel parsing. Order is not important.\n>>>
  let test = \"[{\\\"name\\\": \\\"John\\\", \\\"age\\\": 20}, {\\\"age\\\": 30, \\\"name\\\":
  \\\"Frank\\\"} ]\"\n>>> let parser = arrayOf $ (,) <$> \"name\" .: value\n                               <*>
  \"age\" .: value\n>>> parseByteString  parser test :: [(Text,Int)]\n[(\"John\",20),(\"Frank\",30)]\n\n--
  If you have more results returned from each branch, all are combined.\n>>> let test
  = \"[{\\\"key1\\\": [1,2], \\\"key2\\\": [5,6], \\\"key3\\\": [8,9]}]\"\n>>> let
  parser = arrayOf $ (,) <$> \"key2\" .: (arrayOf value)\n                               <*>
  \"key1\" .: (arrayOf value)\n>>> parse parser test :: [(Int, Int)]\n[(6,2),(6,1),(5,2),(5,1)]\n\n--
  Use <> to return both branches\nlet test = \"[{\\\"key1\\\": [1,2], \\\"key2\\\":
  [5,6], \\\"key3\\\": [8,9]}]\"\n>>> let parser = arrayOf $    \"key1\" .: (arrayOf
  value)\n                           <> \"key2\" .: (arrayOf value)\n>>> parse parser
  test :: [Int]\n[1,2,5,6]\n\n-- objectItems function enriches value with object key\n>>>
  let test = \"[{\\\"key1\\\": [1,2,3], \\\"key2\\\": [5,6,7]}]\"\n>>> parseByteString
  (arrayOf $ objectItems value) test :: [(Text, [Int])]\n[(\"key1\",[1,2,3]),(\"key2\",[5,6,7])]\n>>>
  parseByteString (arrayOf $ objectItems $ arrayOf value) test :: [(Text, Int)]\n[(\"key1\",1),(\"key1\",2),(\"key1\",3),(\"key2\",5),(\"key2\",6),(\"key2\",7)]\n\n--
  .:? produces a maybe value; Nothing if match is not found or is null.\n-- .!= converts
  Maybe back with a default\n>>> let test = \"[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"John\\\", \\\"value\\\":
  12}, {\\\"name\\\":\\\"name2\\\"}]\"\n>>> let parser = arrayOf $ (,) <$> \"name\"
  \ .: string\n                               <*> \"value\" .:? integer .!= 0\n>>>
  parseByteString parser test :: [(String,Int)]\n[(\"John\",12),(\"name2\",0)]\n\n```\n\nSee
