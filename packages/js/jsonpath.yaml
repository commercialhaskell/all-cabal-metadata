  # Changelog for jsonpath-hs

  ## v0.3.0.0 - Lots of breaking changes, they come with new features

  This release aims to address many deviations from similar libraries in other
  programming languages, this is thanks to Christoph Burgmer's
  [json-path-comparison
  project](https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/).

  There has also been significant work in codifying JSONPath by the IETF-WG for
  JSONPath, the draft spec can be acccessed
  [here](https://ietf-wg-jsonpath.github.io/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base.html).
  This release also aims to adapt some of the ideas from from spec.

  As a result there have been significant breaking changes in the types and also
  small changes in the way JSONPaths are executed.

  List of changes:
  * Fix compiler warnings and bugs with non-total pattern matches.
  * Allow double quoted literals and field accessors.
  * Ensure termination when start or end of slice are too big/small.
  * Implement slice execution based on IETF draft spec .
  * Ensure that a valid JSONPath never fails to execute.
  * Drop support for GHC <= 8.2.
  * Use megaparsec instead of attoparsec for better error messages.
  * Allow escape sequences in key names.
  * Allow parsing empty paths.
  * Allow spaces arround index selectors.
  * Allow selecting keys in unions and allow many union elements.
  * Implement 'and', 'or' and 'not' operator support in filters.
  * Allow comparison between two singular paths.
  * Allow bools and nulls in filters.

  ## v0.2.1.0

  * Support and require aeson >= 2

  ## v0.2.0.0

  * BreakingChange: Fix typo in `BeginningPoint`.
  * Fix typo in parser error.

  ## v0.1.0.2

  * Remove upper bounds from dependencies, as most of them are quite stable packages.

  ## v0.1.0.1

  * Import Data.Semigroup to support GHC 8.
  * Add test json files to make sure test sdist compile and runs.

  ## v0.1.0.0

  * Start the project.

  # jsonpath-hs

  Implementation of jsonpath as [described by Steffen GÃ¶essner](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).

  ## State of this library

  This library is still work in progress, but feel free to use it create issues. It lacks some features and has a few variances from the description.

  ### Missing Features
  * The Length funtion: The ability to say `$.length`. It will just look for `length` key as of now.
  * ScriptExpression: The ability to say things like `$.book[(3+1)]`

  ### Variances
  * The `$` sign in the beginning is not compulsory
  * The `$..*` will not produce the root object itself.
  ## Shout out to [JSON-Path-Test-Suite](https://github.com/gregsdennis/JSON-Path-Test-Suite/tree/master/Tests)
  I have copied a few of the tests from there, I will probably just sub-module the repository if and when the whole test suite is green.

  ## Uses
  I am using this library to support GCP authentication in the [Kubernetes haskell client](http://github.com/kubernetes-client/haskell).
