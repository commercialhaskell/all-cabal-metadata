  > Simplified code review

  Usage
  -----

  You find a commit you like (defaults to `HEAD`) and run:

      cr init [<commit>]

  By running this, you claim that you are familiar with the code up to
  this point.

  Later, more changes are pulled into the repo, so you run the following
  to review them:

      cr review


  Installation
  ------------

  This package is on
  [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cr).  To install
  it, run:

      cabal update
      cabal install cr


  Tests
  -----

  There are no tests as of yet, and I am deeply ashamed by this :(


  Background
  ----------

  This is clone of a much better tool developed somewhere else.
