synopsis: Fast, pure and practical SHA-256 implementation
changelog: ! "## 0.11.101.0\n\n - Add `hkdf` function providing HKDF-SHA256 conforming
  to RFC5869\n - Declare `Crypto.Hash.SHA256` module `-XTrustworthy`\n - Remove ineffective
  RULES\n - Convert to `CApiFFI`\n - Added `...AndLength` variants of hashing functions:\n\n

  - Minor optimizations in `hmac` and `hash`\n\n## 0.11.100.1\n\n - Use `__builtin_bswap{32,64}`
  only with GCC >= 4.3\n   ([#1](https://github.com/hvr/cryptohash-sha256/issues/1))\n\n##
  0.11.100.0\n\n - new `hmac` and `hmaclazy` functions providing HMAC-SHA256\n   computation
  conforming to RFC2104 and RFC4231\n - fix unaligned memory-accesses\n\n## 0.11.7.2\n\n
  - switch to 'safe' FFI for calls where overhead becomes neglible\n - removed inline
  assembly in favour of portable C constructs\n - fix 32bit length overflow bug in
  `hash` function\n - fix inaccurate context-size\n - add context-size verification
  to incremental API operations\n\n## 0.11.7.1\n\n - first version forked off `cryptohash-0.11.7`

description: ! 'A practical incremental and one-pass, pure API to

  the [SHA-256 cryptographic hash algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)
  according

  to [FIPS 180-4](http://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.180-4)

  with performance close to the fastest implementations available in other languages.


  The core SHA-256 algorithm is implemented in C and is thus expected

  to be as fast as the standard [sha256sum(1) tool](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sha256sum);

  for instance, on an /Intel Core i7-3770/ at 3.40GHz this implementation can

  compute a SHA-256 hash over 230 MiB of data in under one second.

  (If, instead, you require a pure Haskell implementation and performance is secondary,
  please refer to the [SHA package](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/SHA).)



  Additionally, this package provides support for


  - HMAC-SHA-256: SHA-256-based [Hashed Message Authentication Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC)
  (HMAC)

  - HKDF-SHA-256: [HMAC-SHA-256-based Key Derivation Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HKDF)
  (HKDF)


  conforming to [RFC6234](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6234), [RFC4231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4231),
  [RFC5869](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5869), et al..


  === Relationship to the @cryptohash@ package and its API


  This package has been originally a fork of @cryptohash-0.11.7@ because the @cryptohash@

  package had been deprecated and so this package continues to satisfy the need for
  a

  lightweight package providing the SHA-256 hash algorithm without any dependencies
  on packages

  other than @base@ and @bytestring@. The API exposed by @cryptohash-sha256-0.11.*@''s

  "Crypto.Hash.SHA256" module is guaranteed to remain a compatible superset of the
  API provided

  by the @cryptohash-0.11.7@''s module of the same name.


  Consequently, this package is designed to be used as a drop-in replacement for @cryptohash-0.11.7@''s

  "Crypto.Hash.SHA256" module, though with

  a [clearly smaller footprint by almost 3 orders of magnitude](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/5lxv75/psa_please_use_unique_module_names_when_uploading/dbzegx3/).'
