  # crucible-debug

  `crucible-debug` is a library for interactive debugging of Crucible programs.
  It is structured as an [`ExecutionFeature`][exec-feat], meaning that it can be used in situ inside of any program that uses Crucible.

  [exec-feat]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/crucible-0.7.1/docs/Lang-Crucible-Simulator.html#t:ExecutionFeature

  Users interact with the debugger via a simple command language.
  This language features a number of familiar commands such as setting and removing breakpoints (`break`/`delete`), printing stack traces (`backtrace`), stepping through symbolic execution (`step`), and loading debugger commands from files (`source`).
  It additionally provides more Crucible-specific commands such as inspecting program CFGs (`cfg`) and printing the current path condition (`path-condition`).
  All available commands can be listed using the interactive documentation system (`help`).

  In addition to the library, this package provides an executable.
  The executable begins the debugger inside of a "minimal" Crucible program that immediately returns the unit value `()`.
  This is not very interesting on its own, but the `load` command can load Crucible S-expression programs, and the `call` command can call functions from loaded programs.

  The command language can be extended by downstream packages.
  Such extensions can be used to add commands that are specific to a particular Crucible syntax extension (i.e., source language).
  For example, the `crucible-llvm-debug` package provides the `memory` command to print the current LLVM memory.

  This tool shares some functionality with the [surveyor] project. The principal architectural distinction is that `crucible-debug` is designed to be embedded into larger tools like Crux and SAW, while `surveyor` is a standalone application.

  The test suite is described in its Haddocks.
