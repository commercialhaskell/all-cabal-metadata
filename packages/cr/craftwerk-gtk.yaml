  Gtk UI functions for Craftwerk, a high-level and easy to use graphics library
  with integrated TikZ output.

  Craftwerk is a high-level 2D vector graphics library for output of
  TikZ pictures that can be typeset using (pdf)LaTeX. The TikZ library
  and documentation can be found at: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf>.

  Craftwerk tries to encapsulate the graphics backend such that figures
  can also be rendered with a Cairo backend and quickly displayed in a
  Gtk window. The aim is to support TikZ and Cairo seamlessly as
  possible, meaning that graphics produced with either backend should
  look as similar as possible. Other backends are easily written and the
  aim is to provide generic fallback functions for features that are not
  natively supported by some backend.
