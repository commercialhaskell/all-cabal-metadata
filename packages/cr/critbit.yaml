description: "Crit-bit trees for Haskell\n====\n\nThis is the first purely functional
  implementation of [crit-bit\ntrees](http://cr.yp.to/critbit.html) that I'm aware
  of.\n\nA crit-bit tree is a key/value container that allows efficient lookups\nand
  ordered traversal for data that can be represented as a string of\nbits.\n\nThis
  package exists in part with education in mind:\n\n* The core data structures are
  simple.\n\n* The core algorithms are easy to grasp.\n\n* I have intentionally structured
  the source to be easy to follow and\n  extend.\n\n* Originally, I *deliberately*
  left the package incomplete.  (It has\n  since been substantially fleshed out.)
  \ Ever thought to yourself,\n  \"I'd write a bit of Haskell if only I had a project
  to work on\"?\n  Well, here's your chance!  I will set aside time to review your
  code\n  and answer what questions I can.\n\nEducation aside, crit-bit trees offer
  some interesting features\ncompared to other key/value container types in Haskell.\n\n*
  For some operations, they are much faster than `Data.Map` from the\n  `containers`
  package, while for others, they are slower.\n\n* Compared to `Data.HashMap`, you
  get about the same lookup\n  performance, but also some features that a hash-based
  structure\n  can't provide: prefix-based search, efficient neighbour lookup,\n  ordered
  storage.\n\nOf course crit-bit trees have some downsides, too. For example,\nbuilding
  a tree from randomly ordered inputs is somewhat slow, and of\ncourse the set of
  usable key types is small (only types that can be\ninterpreted as bitstrings \"for
  free\").\n\nCompared to the most easily findable crit-bit tree code you'll come\nacross
  that's [written in C](https://github.com/glk/critbit), the core\nof this library
  has a lot less accidental complexity, and so may be\neasier to understand. It also
  handles arbitrary binary data that will\ncause the C library to go wrong.\n\n\n\nHow
  to contribute\n====\n\nI've purposely published this package in an incomplete state,
  and I'd\nlike your help to round it out.  In return, you get to learn a little\nHaskell,
  have your code reviewed by someone who wants to see you\nsucceed, and contribute
  to a rather nifty library.\n\nDo you need any prior experience with Haskell to get
  started? No! All\nyou need is curiosity and the ability to learn from context. Oh,
  and a\ngithub account.\n\nMy aim with this library is drop-in API compatibility
  with the widely\nused Haskell [`containers`](https://github.com/haskell/containers)\nlibrary,
  which has two happy consequences:\n\n* There are lots of functions to write!\n\n*
  In almost every case, you'll find a pre-existing function in\n  `containers` that
  (from a user's perspective) does exactly what its\n  counterparts in *this* library
  ought to do.\n\n\nGetting started\n----\n\nIf you want to contribute or play around,
  please use the most modern\nversion of the [Haskell Platform](http://www.haskell.org/platform/).\n\nOnce
  you have the Platform installed, there are just a few more steps.\n\nSet up your
  local database of known open source Haskell packages.\n\n    cabal update\n\nBoth
  the new `cabal` command and `cabal-dev` will install to\n`$HOME/.cabal/bin`, so
  put that directory at the front of your shell's\nsearch path before you continue.\n\nGet
  the `critbit` source.\n\n    git clone git://github.com/bos/critbit\n\nSet up a
  sandbox.\n\nThe first time through, you may need to download and install a ton of\ndependencies,
  so hang in there.\n\n    cd critbit\n    cabal sandbox init\n    cabal install \\\n\t--enable-tests
  \\\n\t--enable-benchmarks \\\n    \t--only-dependencies \\\n\t-j\n\nThe `-j` flag
  above tells `cabal` to use all of your CPUs, so even the\ninitial build shouldn't
  take more than a few minutes.\n\nTo actually build:\n\n    cabal build\n\n\nRunning
  the test suite\n----\n\nOnce you've built the code, you can run the entire test
  suite fairly\nquickly.  This takes about 30 seconds on my oldish 8-core Mac laptop:\n\n
  \   dist/build/tests/tests +RTS -N\n\n(The `+RTS -N` above tells GHC's runtime system
  to use all available\ncores.)\n\nIf you're feeling impatient, run a subset of the
  test suite:\n\n    dist/build/tests/tests -t properties/map/bytestring +RTS -N\n\nAnd
  if you want to explore, the `tests` program accepts a `--help`\noption. Try it out.\n\n\nRunning
  benchmarks\n----\n\nIt is just as easy to benchmark stuff as to test it.\n\nFirst,
  you need a dictionary. If your system doesn't have a file named\n`/usr/share/dict/words`,
  you can [download a dictionary\nhere](http://www.cs.duke.edu/~ola/ap/linuxwords).\n\nIf
  you've downloaded a dictionary, tell the benchmark\nsuite where to find it by setting
  the `WORDS` environment variable.\n\n    export WORDS=/my/path/to/linuxwords\n\nYou
  can then run benchmarks and generate a report. For instance, this\nruns every benchmark
  that begins with `bytestring/lookup`.\n\n    dist/build/benchmarks/benchmarks -o
  lookup.html \\\n        bytestring/lookup\n\nOpen the `lookup.html` file in your
  browser. [Here's an\nexample](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/bos/critbit/blob/master/doc/criterion-sample-lookup.html)\nof
  what to expect.\n\nAs with `tests`, run the `benchmarks` program with `--help` if
  you\nwant to do some exploring.\n\n\n\nWhat your code should look like\n----\n\nOkay,
  so you've bought into this idea, and would like to try writing a\npatch. How to
  begin?\n\nI've generally tried to write commits with a view to being readable,\nso
  there are examples you can follow.\n\nFor instance, [here's the commit where I added
  the `keys`\nfunction](https://github.com/bos/critbit/commit/48438b48ca9bc5d96c1987afe7acdf4dada823f3).
  This\ncommit follows a simple pattern:\n\n* [Uncomment the export](https://github.com/bos/critbit/commit/48438b48ca9bc5d96c1987afe7acdf4dada823f3#L0L91)
  of the function.\n\n* [Write the function\n  definition](https://github.com/bos/critbit/commit/48438b48ca9bc5d96c1987afe7acdf4dada823f3#L0R503).\n
  \ In this case, the documentation is taken almost verbatim from the\n  corresponding
  function in [the `Data.Map`\n  module](https://github.com/haskell/containers/blob/342a95002822cca56f2d5b086cdd5a98592d5c10/Data/Map/Base.hs#L1889).\n\n*
  [Write a\n  test](https://github.com/bos/critbit/commit/48438b48ca9bc5d96c1987afe7acdf4dada823f3#L2R108)\n
  \ and [make sure it gets\n  run](https://github.com/bos/critbit/commit/48438b48ca9bc5d96c1987afe7acdf4dada823f3#L2R124).\n\n*
  [Add an entry to the benchmark\n  suite](https://github.com/bos/critbit/commit/48438b48ca9bc5d96c1987afe7acdf4dada823f3#L1R179)\n
  \ so it's easy to see how this compares to other key/value map types.\n\nNaturally,
  you'll follow the prevailing coding and formatting style.\nIf you forget, I'll be
  sad and offer you only a terse \"fix your\nformatting\" review, and then you'll
  be sad too.\n\n\nWhat your commits should look like\n----\n\nPlease follow the guidelines
  below, as they make it easier to review\nyour pull request and deal with your commits
  afterwards.\n\n* One logical idea per commit! If you want to add five functions,\n
  \ that's fine, but please spread them across five commits.\n\n* Do not reorganize
  or refactor unrelated code in a commit whose\n  purpose is to add new code.\n\n*
  When you add a new function, add its tests and benchmarks in the\n  same commit.\n\n*
  <b>Do not add trailing whitespace</b>. Follow the same formatting\n  and naming
  conventions as you already see in the code around you.\n\n* Keep your maximum line
  length at 80 columns for everything except\n  lines of example code in documentation.\n\n(If
  you can't follow the guidelines, there's a good chance I'll ask\nyou to fix your
  commits and resubmit them.)\n"
