  # 2.11.0

  ## Language changes

  * The `newtype` construct, which has existed in the interpreter in an
    incomplete and undocumented form for quite a while, is now fullly
    supported. The construct is documented in section 1.22 of [Programming
    Cryptol](https://cryptol.net/files/ProgrammingCryptol.pdf). Note,
    however, that the `cryptol-remote-api` RPC server currently does not
    include full support for referring to `newtype` names, though it can
    work with implementations that use `newtype` internally.

  ## New features

  * By default, the interpreter will now track source locations of
    expressions being evaluated, and retain call stack information.
    This information is incorporated into error messages arising from
    runtime errors. This additional bookkeeping incurs significant
    runtime overhead, but may be disabled using the `--no-call-stacks`
    command-line option.

  * The `:exhaust` command now works for floating-point types and the
    `:check` command now uses more representative sampling of
    floating-point input values to test.

  * The `cryptol-remote-api` RPC server now has methods corresponding to
    the `:prove` and `:sat` commands in the REPL.

  * The `cryptol-eval-server` executable is a new, stateless server
    providing a subset of the functionality of `cryptol-remote-api`
    dedicated entirely to invoking Cryptol functions on concrete inputs.

  ## Internal changes

  * A single running instance of the SMT solver used for type checking
    (Z3) is now used to check a larger number of type correctness queries.
    This means that fewer solver instances are invoked, and type checking
    should generally be faster.

  * The Cryptol interpreter now builds against `libBF` version 0.6, which
    fixes a few bugs in the evaluation of floating-point operations.

  ## Bug fixes

  * Closed issues #118, #398, #426, #470, #491, #567, #594, #639, #656,

  # 2.10.0

  ## Language changes

  * Cryptol now supports primality checking at the type level. The
    type-level predicate `prime` is true when its parameter passes the
    Miller-Rabin probabilistic primality test implemented in the GMP
    library.

  * The `Z p` type is now a `Field` when `p` is prime, allowing additional
    operations on `Z p` values.

  * The literals `0` and `1` can now be used at type `Bit`, as
    alternatives for `False` and `True`, respectively.

  ## New features

  * The interpreter now includes a number of primitive functions that
    allow faster execution of a number of common cryptographic functions,
    including the core operations of AES and SHA-2, operations on GF(2)
    polynomials (the existing `pmod`, `pdiv`, and `pmult` functions), and
    some operations on prime field elliptic curves. These functions are
    useful for implementing higher-level algorithms, such as many
    post-quantum schemes, with more acceptable performance than possible
    when running a top-to-bottom Cryptol implementation in the
    interpreter.

    For a full list of the new primitives, see the new Cryptol
    [`SuiteB`](https://github.com/GaloisInc/cryptol/blob/master/lib/SuiteB.cry)
    and
    [`PrimeEC`](https://github.com/GaloisInc/cryptol/blob/master/lib/PrimeEC.cry)
    modules.

  * The REPL now allows lines containing only comments, making it easier
    to copy and paste examples.

  * The interpreter has generally improved performance overall.

  * Several error messages are more comprehensible and less verbose.

  * Cryptol releases and nightly builds now include an RPC server
    alongside the REPL. This provides an alternative interface to the same
    interpreter and proof engine available from the REPL, but is
    better-suited to programmatic use. Details on the protocol used by the
    server are available
    [here](https://github.com/GaloisInc/argo/blob/master/docs/Protocol.rst).
    A Python client for this protocol is available
    [here](https://github.com/GaloisInc/argo/tree/master/python).

  * Windows builds are now distributed as both `.tar.gz` and `.msi` files.

  ## Bug Fixes

  * Closed issues #98, #485, #713, #744, #746, #787, #796, #803, #818,
    #826, #838, #856, #873, #875, #876, #877, #879, #880, #881, #883,

  # 2.9.1

  ## Language changes

  * The type of `generate` which is used for `a@i` sequence definitions,
     is generalized so that the index type can be any `Integral` type
     large enough to index the entire array being defined.

  ## Bug Fixes

  * Closed issues #848, #850, #851, #859, and #861.

  * Fixed Windows installer paths.

  # 2.9.0

  ## Language changes

  * Removed the `Arith` class. Replaced it instead with more specialized
    numeric classes: `Ring`, `Integral`, `Field`, and `Round`.  `Ring`
    is the closest analogue to the old `Arith` class; it contains the
    `fromInteger`, `(+)`, `(*)`, `(-)` and `negate` methods.  `Ring`
    contains all the base arithmetic types in Cryptol, and lifts
    pointwise over tuples, sequences and functions, just as `Arith` did.

    The new `Integral` class now contains the integer division and
    modulus methods (`(/)` and `(%)`), and the sequence indexing,
    sequence update and shifting operations are generalized over
    `Integral`.  The `toInteger` operation is also generalized over this
    class.  `Integral` contains the bitvector types and `Integer`.

    The new `Field` class contains types representing mathematical
    fields (or types that are approximately fields). It is currently
    inhabited by the new `Rational` type, and the `Float`
    family of types.  It will eventually also contain the
    `Real` type. It has the operation `recip` for reciprocal
    and `(/.)` for field division (not to be confused for `(/)`,
    which is Euclidean integral division).

    There is also a new `Round` class for types that can sensibly be
    rounded to integers.  This class has the methods `floor`, `ceiling`,
    `trunc`, `roundToEven` and `roundAway` for performing different
    kinds of integer rounding.  `Rational` and `Float` inhabit `Round`.

    The type of `(^^)` is modified to be
    `{a, e} (Ring a, Integral e) => a -> e -> a`. This makes it clear
    that the semantics are iterated multiplication, which makes sense
    in any ring.

    Finally, the `lg2`, `(/$)` and `(%$)` methods of `Arith` have
    had their types specialized so they operate only on bitvectors.

  * Added an `Eq` class, and moved the equality operations
    from `Cmp` into `Eq`. The `Z` type becomes a member of `Eq`
    but not `Cmp`.

  * Added a base `Rational` type.  It is implemented as a pair of
    integers, quotiented in the usual way.  As such, it reduces to the
    theory of integers and requires no new solver support (beyond
    nonlinear integer arithmetic).  `Rational` inhabits the new
    `Field` and `Round` classes.  Rational values can be
    constructed using the `ratio` function, or via `fromInteger`.

  * The `generate` function (and thus `x @ i= e` definitions) has had
    its type specialized so the index type is always `Integer`.

  * The new typeclasses are arranged into a class hierarchy, and the
    typechecker will use that information to infer superclass instances
    from subclasses.

  * Added a family of base types, `Float e p`, for working with
    floating point numbers.  The parameters control the precision of
    the numbers, with `e` being the number of bits to use in the exponent
    and `p-1` being the number of bits to use in the mantissa.
    The `Float` family of types may be used through the usual overloaded
    functionality in Cryptol, and there is a new built-in module called
    `Float`, which contains functionality specific to floating point numbers.

  * Add a way to write fractional literals in base 2,8,10, and 16.
    Fractional literals are overloaded, and may be used for different types
    (currently `Rational` and the `Float` family).  Fractional literal in base
    2,8,and 16 must be precise, and will be rejected statically if they cannot be
    represented exactly.  Fractional literals in base 10 are rounded to the
    nearest even representable number.

  * Changes to the defaulting algorithm. The new algorithm only applies
    to constraints arising from literals (i.e., `Literal` and `FLiteral`
    constraints).  The guiding principle is that we now default these
    to one of the infinite precision types `Integer` or `Rational`.
    `Literal` constraints are defaulted to `Integer`, unless the corresponding
    type also has `Field` constraint, in which case we use `Rational`.
    Fractional literal constraints are always defaulted to `Rational.


  ## New features

  * Document the behavior of lifted selectors.

  * Added support for symbolic simulation via the `What4` library
    in addition to the previous method based on `SBV`. The What4
    symbolic simulator is used when selecting solvers with the `w4`
    prefix, such as `w4-z3`, `w4-cvc4`, `w4-yices`, etc.
    The `SBV` and `What4` libraries make different tradeoffs in how
    they represent formulae. You may find one works better than another
    for the same problem, even with the same solver.

  * More detailed information about the status of various symbols
    in the output of the `:browse` command (issue #688).

  * The `:safe` command will attempt to prove that a given Cryptol
    term is safe; in other words, that it will not encounter a run-time
    error for all inputs. Run-time errors arise from things like
    division-by-zero, index-out-of-bounds situations and
    explicit calls to `error` or `assert`.

  * The `:prove` and `:sat` commands now incorporate safety predicates
    by default. In a `:sat` call, models will only be found that do not
    cause run-time errors. For `:prove` calls, the safety conditions are
    added as additional proof goals.  The prior behavior
    (which ignored safety conditions) can be restored using
    `:set ignore-safety = on`.

  * Improvements to the `any` prover. It will now shut down external
    prover processes correctly when one finds a solution. It will also
    wait for the first _successful_ result to be returned from a prover,
    instead of failing as soon as one prover fails.

  * An experimental `parmap` primitive that applies a function to a
    sequence of arguments and computes the results in parallel.  This
    operation should be considered experimental and may significantly
    change or disappear in the future, and could possibly uncover
    unknown race conditions in the interpreter.

  ## Bug fixes

  * Closed issues #346, #444, #614, #617, #636, #660, #662, #663, #664,
    #667, #670, #702, #711, #712, #716, #723, #725, #731, #835, #836,
    #839, #840, and #845

  # 2.8.0 (September 4, 2019)

  ## New features

  * Added support for indexing on the left-hand sides of declarations,
    record field constructors, and record updaters (issue #577). This
    builds on a new primitive function called `generate`, where the new
    syntax `x @ i = e` is sugar for `x = generate (\i -> e)`.

  * Added support for element type ascriptions on sequence enumerations.
    The syntax `[a,b..c:t]` indicates that the elements should be of type
    `t`.

  * Added support for wildcards in sequence enumerations. For example, the
    syntax `[1 .. _] : [3][8]` yields `[0x01, 0x02, 0x03]`. It can also be
    used polymorphically. For example, the most general type of `[1 .. _]`
    is `{n, a} (n >= 1, Literal n a, fin n) => [n]a`

  * Changed the syntax of type signatures to allow multiple constraint
    arrows in type schemas (issue #599). The following are now equivalent:

          f : {a} (fin a, a >= 1) => [a] -> [a]

          f : {a} (fin a) => (a >= 1) => [a] -> [a]

  * Added a mechanism for user-defined type constraint operators, and use
    this to define the new type constraint synonyms (<) and (>) (issues
    #400, #618).

  * Added support for primitive type declarations. The prelude now uses
    this mechanism to declare all of the basic types.

  * Added support for Haskell-style "block arguments", reducing the need
    for parentheses in some cases. For example, `generate (\i -> i +1)`
    can now be written `generate \i -> i + 1`.

  * Improved shadowing errors (part of the fix for issue #569).

  ## Bug fixes

  * Closed many issues, including #265, #367, #437, #508, #522, #549,
    #557, #559, #569, #578, #590, #595, #596, #601, #607, #608, #610,
    #615, #621, and #636.

  # 2.7.0 (April 30, 2019)

  ## New features

  * Added syntax for record updates (see #399 for details of implemented
  and planned features).

  * Updated the `:browse` command to list module parameters (issue #586).

  * Added support for test vector creation (the `:dumptests` command).
  This feature computes a list of random inputs and outputs for the
  given expression of function type and saves it to a file. This is
  useful for generating tests from a trusted Cryptol specification to
  apply to an implementation written in another language.

  ## Breaking changes

  * Removed the `[x..]` construct from the language (issue #574). It
  was shorthand for `[x..2^^n-1]` for a bit vector of size `n`, which was
  often not what the user intended. Users should instead write either
  `[x..y]` or `[x...]`, to construct a smaller range or a lazy sequence,
  respectively.

  * Renamed the value-level `width` function to `length`, and generalized
  its type (issue #550). It does not behave identically to the
  type-level `width` operator, which led to confusion. The name
  `length` matches more closely with similar functions in other
  languages.

  ## Bug fixes

  * Improved type checking performance of decimal literals.

  * Improved type checking of `/^` and `%^` (issues #581, #582).

  * Improved performance of sequence updates with the `update` primitive
  (issue #579).

  * Fixed elapsed time printed by `:prove` and `:sat` (issue #572).

  * Fixed SMT-Lib formulas generated for right shifts (issue #566).

  * Fixed crash when importing non-parameterized modules with the
  backtick prefix (issue #565).

  * Improved performance of symbolic execution for `Z n` (issue #554).

  * Fixed interpretation of the `satNum` option so finding multiple
  solutions doesn't run forever (issue #553).

  * Improved type checking of the `length` function (issue #548).

  * Improved error message when trying to prove properties in
  parameterized modules (issue #545).

  * Stopped warning about defaulting at the REPL when `warnDefaulting` is
  set to `false` (issue #543).

  * Fixed builds on non-x86 architectures (issue #542).

  * Made browsing of interactively-bound identifiers work better (issue #538).

  * Fixed a bug that allowed changing the semantics of the `_ # _`
  pattern and the `-` and `~` operators by creating local definitions
  of functions that they expand to (issue #568).

  * Closed issues #498, #547, #551, #562, and #563.
