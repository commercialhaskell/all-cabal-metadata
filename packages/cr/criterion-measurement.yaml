  0.2.1.0

  * Make the behavior of the benchmarking functions independent of the
    `-fspec-const-count` limit.

  0.2.0.0

  * Add a `measPeakMbAllocated` field to `Measured` for reporting maximum
    megabytes allocated. Naturally, this affects the behavior of `Measured`'s
    `{To,From}JSON` and `Binary` instances.

  0.1.4.0

  * Fix a bug that occurred with GHC 9.2.4 or later that would cause incorrect
    measurements.

  0.1.3.0

  * Change `criterion_rdtsc` to return `mach_absolute_time` on macOS. This is a
    portable way of returning the number of CPU cycles that works on both Intel-
    and ARM-based Macs.

  * Change `criterion_gettime` to use `clock_gettime_nsec_np` instead of
    `mach_absolute_time` on macOS. While `mach_absolute_time` has nanosecond
    resolution on Intel-based Macs, this is not the case on ARM-based Macs, so
    the previous `mach_absolute_time`-based implementation would return incorrect
    timing results on Apple silicon.

    There are two minor consequences of this change:

    * `criterion-measurement` now only supports macOS 10.02 or later, as that is
      the first version to have `clock_gettime_nsec_np`. As macOS 10.02 was
      released in 2002, this is unlikely to affect users, but please speak up if
      this is a problem for you.

    * As `clock_gettime_nsec_np` does not require any special initialization
      code, `criterion_inittime` is now a no-op on macOS. If you manually invoke
      the `getTime` function in your code, however, it is still important that
      you `initializeTime` beforehand, as this is still required for the Windows
      implementation to work correctly.

  0.1.2.0

  * Ensure that `Criterion.Measurement.Types.Internal` is always compiled with
    optimizations, even if the `criterion-measurement` library itself happens to
    be built with `-O0` or `-fprof-auto`. This is necessary to ensure that the
    inner benchmarking loop of criterion always finishes in a timely manner,
    even if the rest of the library is not fully optimized.

  0.1.1.0

  * Add `nfAppIO` and `whnfAppIO` functions, which take a function and its
    argument separately like `nf`/`whnf`, but whose function returns `IO` like
    `nfIO`/`whnfIO`. This is useful for benchmarking functions in which the bulk
    of the work is not bound by IO, but by pure computations that might otherwise
    be optimized away if the argument is known statically.

  0.1.0.0

  * This is the first release of `criterion-measurement`. The changelog notes
    below are copied from the notes for the corresponding `criterion` release,
    `criterion-1.5.0.0`.

  * Move the measurement functionality of `criterion` into a standalone package,
    `criterion-measurement`. In particular, `cbits/` and `Criterion.Measurement`
    are now in `criterion-measurement`, along with the relevant definitions of
    `Criterion.Types` and `Criterion.Types.Internal` (both of which are now under
    the `Criterion.Measurement.*` namespace).
    Consequently, `criterion` now depends on `criterion-measurement`.

    This will let other libraries (e.g. alternative statistical analysis
    front-ends) to import the measurement functionality alone as a lightweight
    dependency.

  * Fix a bug on macOS and Windows where using `runAndAnalyse` and other
    lower-level benchmarking functions would result in an infinite loop.

  # criterion-measurement

  [![Build Status](https://github.com/haskell/criterion/workflows/Haskell-CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/haskell/criterion/actions?query=workflow%3AHaskell-CI)

  Measurement-related functionality extracted from Criterion, with minimal dependencies. The rationale for this is to enable alternative analysis front-ends.
