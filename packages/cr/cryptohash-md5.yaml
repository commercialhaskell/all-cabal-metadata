     computation conforming to RFC2104 and RFC2202

  ## 0.11.7.2

   - switch to 'safe' FFI for calls where overhead becomes neglible
   - removed inline assembly in favour of portable C constructs
   - fix 32bit length overflow bug in `hash` function
   - fix inaccurate context-size
   - add context-size verification to incremental API operations
   - fix unaligned memory-accesses

description: |
  A practical incremental and one-pass, pure API to the
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5 MD5 hash algorithm>
  (including <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC HMAC> support)
  with performance close to the fastest implementations available in other languages.

  The implementation is made in C with a haskell FFI wrapper that hides the C implementation.

  If, instead, you require a pure Haskell implementation and performance is secondary, please refer to the [pureMD5 package](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pureMD5).

  === Packages in the @cryptohash-*@ family

  - <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cryptohash-md5    cryptohash-md5>
  - <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cryptohash-sha1   cryptohash-sha1>
  - <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cryptohash-sha256 cryptohash-sha256>
  - <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cryptohash-sha512 cryptohash-sha512>

  === Relationship to the @cryptohash@ package and its API

  This package has been originally a fork of @cryptohash-0.11.7@ because the @cryptohash@
  package had been deprecated and so this package continues to satisfy the need for a
  lightweight package providing the MD5 hash algorithm without any dependencies on packages
  other than @base@ and @bytestring@. The API exposed by @cryptohash-md5-0.11.*@'s
  "Crypto.Hash.MD5" module is guaranteed to remain a compatible superset of the API provided
  by the @cryptohash-0.11.7@'s module of the same name.

  Consequently, this package is designed to be used as a drop-in replacement for @cryptohash-0.11.7@'s
  "Crypto.Hash.MD5" module, though with
  a [clearly smaller footprint by almost 3 orders of magnitude](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/5lxv75/psa_please_use_unique_module_names_when_uploading/dbzegx3/).
