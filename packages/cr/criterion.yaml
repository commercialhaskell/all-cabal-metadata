synopsis: Robust, reliable performance measurement and analysis
changelog: ! "1.5.1.0\n\n* Add a `MonadFail Criterion` instance.\n\n* Add some documentation
  in `Criterion.Main` about `criterion-measurement`'s\n  new `nfAppIO` and `whnfAppIO`
  functions, which `criterion` reexports.\n\n1.5.0.0\n\n* Move the measurement functionality
  of `criterion` into a standalone package,\n  `criterion-measurement`. In particular,
  `cbits/` and `Criterion.Measurement`\n  are now in `criterion-measurement`, along
  with the relevant definitions of\n  `Criterion.Types` and `Criterion.Types.Internal`
  (both of which are now under\n  the `Criterion.Measurement.*` namespace).\n  Consequently,
  `criterion` now depends on `criterion-measurement`.\n\n  This will let other libraries
  (e.g. alternative statistical analysis\n  front-ends) to import the measurement
  functionality alone as a lightweight\n  dependency.\n\n* Fix a bug on macOS and
  Windows where using `runAndAnalyse` and other\n  lower-level benchmarking functions
  would result in an infinite loop.\n\n1.4.1.0\n\n* Use `base-compat-batteries`.\n\n1.4.0.0\n\n*
  We now do three samples for statistics:\n\n  * `performMinorGC` before the first
  sample, to ensure it's up to date.\n  * Take another sample after the action, without
  a garbage collection, so we\n    can gather legitimate readings on GC-related statistics.\n
  \ * Then `performMinorGC` and sample once more, so we can get up-to-date\n    readings
  on other metrics.\n\n  The type of `applyGCStatistics` has changed accordingly.
  Before, it was:\n\n  ```haskell\n     Maybe GCStatistics -- ^ Statistics gathered
  at the end of a run.\n  -> Maybe GCStatistics -- ^ Statistics gathered at the beginning
  of a run.\n  -> Measured -> Measured\n  ```\n\n  Now, it is:\n\n  ```haskell\n     Maybe
  GCStatistics -- ^ Statistics gathered at the end of a run, post-GC.\n  -> Maybe
  GCStatistics -- ^ Statistics gathered at the end of a run, pre-GC.\n  -> Maybe GCStatistics
  -- ^ Statistics gathered at the beginning of a run.\n  -> Measured -> Measured\n
  \ ```\n\n  When diffing `GCStatistics` in `applyGCStatistics`, we carefully choose\n
  \ whether to diff against the end stats pre- or post-GC.\n\n* Use `performMinorGC`
  rather than `performGC` to update garbage collection\n  statistics. This improves
  the benchmark performance of fast functions on large\n  objects.\n\n* Fix a bug
  in the `ToJSON Measured` instance which duplicated the\n  mutator CPU seconds where
  GC CPU seconds should go.\n\n* Fix a bug in sample analysis which incorrectly accounted
  for overhead\n  causing runtime errors and invalid results. Accordingly, the buggy\n
  \ `getOverhead` function has been removed.\n\n* Fix a bug in `Measurement.measure`
  which inflated the reported time taken\n  for `perRun` benchmarks.\n\n* Reduce overhead
  of `nf`, `whnf`, `nfIO`, and `whnfIO` by removing allocation\n  from the central
  loops.\n\n1.3.0.0\n\n* `criterion` was previously reporting the following statistics
  incorrectly\n  on GHC 8.2 and later:\n\n  * `gcStatsBytesAllocated`\n  * `gcStatsBytesCopied`\n
  \ * `gcStatsGcCpuSeconds`\n  * `gcStatsGcWallSeconds`\n\n  This has been fixed.\n\n*
  The type signature of `runBenchmarkable` has changed from:\n\n  ```haskell\n  Benchmarkable
  -> Int64 -> (a -> a -> a) -> (IO () -> IO a) -> IO a\n  ```\n\n  to:\n\n  ```haskell\n
  \ Benchmarkable -> Int64 -> (a -> a -> a) -> (Int64 -> IO () -> IO a) -> IO a\n
  \ ```\n\n  The extra `Int64` argument represents how many iterations are being timed.\n\n*
  Remove the deprecated `getGCStats` and `applyGCStats` functions (which have\n  been
  replaced by `getGCStatistics` and `applyGCStatistics`).\n* Remove the deprecated
  `forceGC` field of `Config`, as well as the\n  corresponding `--no-gc` command-line
  option.\n* The header in generated JSON output mistakenly used the string `\"criterio\"`.\n
  \ This has been corrected to `\"criterion\"`.\n\n1.2.6.0\n\n* Add error bars and
  zoomable navigation to generated HTML report graphs.\n\n  (Note that there have
  been reports that this feature can be somewhat unruly\n  when using macOS and Firefox
  simultaneously. See\n  https://github.com/flot/flot/issues/1554 for more details.)\n\n*
  Use a predetermined set of cycling colors for benchmark groups in HTML\n  reports.
  This avoids a bug in earlier versions of `criterion` where benchmark\n  group colors
  could be chosen that were almost completely white, which made\n  them impossible
  to distinguish from the background.\n\n1.2.5.0\n\n* Add an `-fembed-data-files`
  flag. Enabling this option will embed the\n  `data-files` from `criterion.cabal`
  directly into the binary, producing\n  a relocatable executable. (This has the downside
  of increasing the binary\n  size significantly, so be warned.)\n\n1.2.4.0\n\n* Fix
  issue where `--help` would display duplicate options.\n\n1.2.3.0\n\n* Add a `Semigroup`
  instance for `Outliers`.\n\n* Improve the error messages that are thrown when forcing
  nonexistent\n  benchmark environments.\n\n* Explicitly mark `forceGC` as deprecated.
  `forceGC` has not had any effect\n  for several releases, and it will be removed
  in the next major `criterion`\n  release.\n\n1.2.2.0\n\n* Important bugfix: versions
  1.2.0.0 and 1.2.1.0 were incorrectly displaying\n  the lower and upper bounds for
  measured values on HTML reports.\n\n* Have `criterion` emit warnings if suspicious
  things happen during mustache\n  template substitution when creating HTML reports.
  This can be useful when\n  using custom templates with the `--template` flag.\n\n1.2.1.0\n\n*
  Add `GCStatistics`, `getGCStatistics`, and `applyGCStatistics` to\n  `Criterion.Measurement`.
  These are inteded to replace `GCStats` (which has\n  been deprecated in `base` and
  will be removed in GHC 8.4), as well as\n  `getGCStats` and `applyGCStats`, which
  have also been deprecated and will be\n  removed in the next major `criterion` release.\n\n*
  Add new matchers for the `--match` flag:\n  * `--match pattern`, which matches by
  searching for a given substring in\n    benchmark paths.\n  * `--match ipattern`,
  which is like `--match pattern` but case-insensitive.\n\n* Export `Criterion.Main.Options.config`.\n\n*
  Export `Criterion.toBenchmarkable`, which behaves like the `Benchmarkable`\n  constructor
  did prior to `criterion-1.2.0.0`.\n\n1.2.0.0\n\n* Use `statistics-0.14`.\n\n* Replace
  the `hastache` dependency with `microstache`.\n\n* Add support for per-run allocation/cleanup
  of the environment with\n  `perRunEnv` and `perRunEnvWithCleanup`,\n\n* Add support
  for per-batch allocation/cleanup with\n  `perBatchEnv` and `perBatchEnvWithCleanup`.\n\n*
  Add `envWithCleanup`, a variant of `env` with cleanup support.\n\n* Add the `criterion-report`
  executable, which creates reports from previously\n  created JSON files.\n\n1.1.4.0\n\n*
  Unicode output is now correctly printed on Windows.\n\n* Add Safe Haskell annotations.\n\n*
  Add `--json` option for writing reports in JSON rather than binary\n  format.  Also:
  various bugfixes related to this.\n\n* Use the `js-jquery` and `js-flot` libraries
  to substitute in JavaScript code\n  into the default HTML report template.\n\n*
  Use the `code-page` library to ensure that `criterion` prints out Unicode\n  characters
  (like ², which `criterion` uses in reports) in a UTF-8-compatible\n  code page on
  Windows.\n\n* Give an explicit implementation for `get` in the `Binary Regression`\n
  \ instance. This should fix sporadic `criterion` failures with older versions\n
  \ of `binary`.\n\n* Use `tasty` instead of `test-framework` in the test suites.\n\n*
  Restore support for 32-bit Intel CPUs.\n\n* Restore build compatibilty with GHC
  7.4.\n\n1.1.1.0\n\n* If a benchmark uses `Criterion.env` in a non-lazy way, and
  you try\n  to use `--list` to list benchmark names, you'll now get an\n  understandable
  error message instead of something cryptic.\n\n* We now flush stdout and stderr
  after printing messages, so that\n  output is printed promptly even when piped (e.g.
  into a pager).\n\n* A new function `runMode` allows custom benchmarking applications
  to\n  run benchmarks with control over the `Mode` used.\n\n* Added support for Linux
  on non-Intel CPUs.\n\n* This version supports GHC 8.\n\n* The `--only-run` option
  for benchmarks is renamed to `--iters`.\n\n1.1.0.0\n\n* The dependency on the either
  package has been dropped in favour of a\n  dependency on transformers-compat.  This
  greatly reduces the number\n  of packages criterion depends on.  This shouldn't
  affect the\n  user-visible API.\n\n* The documentation claimed that environments
  were created only when\n  needed, but this wasn't implemented. (gh-76)\n\n* The
  package now compiles with GHC 7.10.\n\n* On Windows with a non-Unicode code page,
  printing results used to\n  cause a crash.  (gh-55)\n\n1.0.2.0\n\n* Bump lower bound
  on optparse-applicative to 0.11 to handle yet more\n  annoying API churn.\n\n1.0.1.0\n\n*
  Added a lower bound of 0.10 on the optparse-applicative dependency,\n  as there
  were major API changes between 0.9 and 0.10.\n"
