description: |-
  This library provides a unified interface for managing secure, shared credentials.
  It uses Amazon Key Management Service (KMS) for master key management, locally
  encrypts and decrypts secrets, which are then stored in any of the supported
  storage backends. (Currently DynamoDB.)

  The use-case is to avoid storing sensitive information such as passwords and
  connection strings in plaintext in places such as source control or on
  developers' machines. Instead you can securely administer and distribute
  secrets, leveraging Amazon's IAM policies for access control and permissions to
  ensure limited read-only permissions from production/deployed hosts.
  You can embed this library into projects such as web applications to securely
  retrieve sensitive information such as database passwords or private keys on startup.

  A complementary CLI for management of credentials can be installed via
  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/credentials-cli credentials-cli>.
