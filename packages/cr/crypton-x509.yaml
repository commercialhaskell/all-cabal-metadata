  # ChangeLog for crypton-x509

  ## 1.8.0

  * Depend on package `time-hourglass`, rather than `hourglass`. Date and
    time-related types and classes are now those from the former package.
    [#18](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/crypton-certificate/pull/18)
  * Depend on package `crypton-asn1-types >= 0.4.1` rather than `asn1-types`.
    ASN.1-related types and classes are now those from the former package.

  ## 1.7.7

  * Bump requirements to GHC 7.8 and transformers 0.4 series [#130](https://github.com/haskell-tls/hs-certificate/pull/130)
