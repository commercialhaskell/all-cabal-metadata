  # ChangeLog for crypton-x509-system

  ## 1.8.0

  * Depend indirectly on package `time-hourglass`, rather than `hourglass`. Date
    and time-related types and classes are now those from the former package.
    [#18](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/crypton-certificate/pull/18)
  * Depend indirectly on package `crypton-asn1-types >= 0.4.1` rather
    than `asn1-types`. ASN.1-related types and classes are now those from the
    former package.

  ## 1.6.8

  * Prefer OpenSSL env vars: SSL_CERT_FILE and SSL_CERT_DIR
    [#26](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/crypton-certificate/pull/26)
  * Unix defaultSystemPaths: add new Fedora default cert filepath
    [#19](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/crypton-certificate/pull/19)
