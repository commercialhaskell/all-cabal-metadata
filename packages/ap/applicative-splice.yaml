description: |-
  This package defines a quasiquoter that lets you write
  your monadic/applicative programs in direct style, i.e.
  the style in which you would write it in a
  language with side effects. Unlike actual side effects,
  this does not affect purity of the langauge, because it's
  just a syntactic sugar around the usual (\<$>), (\<*>) and
  (>>=) functions.
