  to prevent GHC warnings\n### Added\n- (#121) `ComponentCounter`\n- (#123) `SystemT`
  `MonadUnliftIO` instance\n- (#126) Export `cmapIf` from main `Apecs` module\n- (#130)

  [0.9.5]\n### Added\n- (#99) `collect`\n### Changed\n- (#84) Updated links to articles\n\n##
  [0.9.4]\n### Changed\n- (#86) Add support for GHC 9.2 and Template Haskell 2.18\n\n##
  [0.9.3]\n### Added\n- `newEntity_ = void . newEntity`\n\n## [0.9.2]\n### Changed\n-
  (#68) Add instances of MonadThrow, MonadCatch, and MonadMask to SystemT\n- Cleaned
  up the README\n- Small haddock fixes\n\n## [0.9.1]\n### Changed\n- (#63) Fixed bug
  where `modify` on non-existent components crashes\n\n## [0.9.0]\n### Added\n- (#59)
  Expose `makeMapComponents`, which creates `Component` instances with `Map` stores\n###

  Relaxed the type of `modify` to allow a different return type\n- Constrain the `cmapM_`
  type `(c -> SystemT w m ()) -> SystemT w m ()`, to make it clearer that the inner

  Changed\n- (#58) Added support for Template Haskell 2.15.0.0 through CPP flags\n\n##
  [0.8.2]\n### Changed\n- (#55) Fixed a bug where components where not properly deleted
  from the cache following the cache bitmasking update\n\n## [0.8.1]\n### Changed\n-
  Changed `Cache`s to use bitmasks instead of the remainder operation. This makes
  caches up to three times faster.\n- Fixed bug in `Cache` where the same entity appeared
  in member list of both the cache and the underlying store\n\n## [0.8.0]\nThere are
  a number of unsolved problems in apecs' design space.\nMost notably, it needs a
  good way to do streaming and reactivity, or find a way to integrate with existing
  solutions.\nI'm hesitant to accept some of the feature requests I've gotten because
  they would be obsoleted when we figure this out, and I don't want to pollute the
  API with unstable features.\n\nHowever, I don't think we should let perfect get
  in the way of good.\nSo, apecs 0.8 have new `Apecs.Experimental.*` modules, that
  I want to use for features that might or might not get removed or changed.\nThey
  should provide some conveniences, but the catch is that their API might undergo
  significant changes between point releases (and therefore within LTS'es).\nSome
  of the existing modules were already marked experimental, and those have been moved.\n\n###
  Added\n- Experimental `Head` component\n- `OrdMap` and `IxMap` reactive maps\n\n###
  Changed\n- Moved `ReadOnly` to `Apecs.Stores` since `EntityCounter` now depends
  on it\n- Moved spatial hashing to `Experimental.Util`\n- Moved `Redirect` and `Stores.Extra`
  to `Experimental.Stores`\n- Moved `Reactive` to `Experimental.Reactive`\n- `rget`
  has been replaced by `withReactive`\n- Improved error messages for unsafe operations\n\n##
  [0.7.3]\n### Changed\n- Added Data.Semigroup to Stores.Extra to build with GHC 8.2.2
  in hackage matrix\n\n## [0.7.2]\n### Changed\n- Fixed bug in the `Pushdown` store\n-
  `Apecs` module no longer re-exports the entire `Data.Proxy` module, but instead
  just `Proxy (..)`.\n- Added (approximate?) lower and upper version bounds to dependencies\n\n##
  [0.7.1]\n### Added\n- `$=` and `$~` operators as synonyms for `set` and `get` respectively\n###
  Removed\n- `getAll` and `count`, which were made redundant by `cfold`.\n\n## [0.7.0]\n###
  Added\n- The `Reactive` store and module is a redesign of the `Register` store,
  and provides a more general solution for 'stores that perform additional actions
  when written to'.\n- The `Apecs.Stores.Extra` submodule, which contains the `Pushdown`
  and `ReadOnly` stores. `Pushdown` adds pushdown semantics to stores, and `ReadOnly`
  hides the `ExplSet` instances of whatever it wraps.\n- The `EntityCounter` and associated
  functions have all been specified to `IO`, since `Global EntityCounter` only works
  in IO. Furthermore, `EntityCounter` now uses a `ReadOnly` store, to prevent users
  from accidentally changing its value.\n- `Redirect` component that writes to another
  entity in `cmap`.\n### Changed\n- Default stores have `MonadIO m => m` instances,
  rather than `IO`. This makes it easier to nest `SystemT`.\n- All apecs packages
  have been consolidated into a single git repo.\n- `Apecs.Components` contains the
  components (and corresponding stores) from `Apecs.Core`.\n\n## [0.6.0.0]\n### Changed\n-
  Nothing, but since 0.5.1 was API-breaking I've decided to bump to 0.6\n## [0.5.1.1]\n###
  Changed\n- `Register` needs UndecidableInstances in GHC 8.6.2, I'm looking for a
  way around this. I've removed it for now.\n\n## [0.5.1.0]\n### Added\n- The `Register`
  store, which allows reverse lookups for bounded enums.\n  For example, if `Bool`
  has storage `Register (Map Bool)`, `regLookup True` will yield a list of all entities
  with a `True` component.\n  Can also be used to emulate a hash table, where `fromEnum`
  is the hashing function.\n  This allows us to make simple spatial hashes.\n  I'm
  open to suggestions for better names than Register.\n- `cmapIf`, cmap with a conditional
  test\n### Changed\n- `ExplInit` now too takes a monad argument.\n- Started rewrite
  of the test suite\n- Caches now internally use -2 to denote absence, to avoid possible
  conflict with -1 as a global entity\n### Removed\n- The STM instances have been
  removed, to be moved to their own package\n\n## [0.5.0.0]\n### Changed\n- `System
  w a` is now a synonym for `SystemT w IO a`.\n  A variable monad argument allows
  apecs to be run in monads like ST or STM.\n  Most of the library has been rewritten
  to be as permissive as possible in its monad argument.\n### Added\n- STM stores.
  These will be moved to a separate package soon.\n\n## [0.4.1.2]\n### Changed\n-
  Either can now be deleted, deleting `Either a b` is the same as deleting `(a,b)`.\n-
  Some were missing their inline pragma's, now they don't\n\n## [0.4.1.1]\n### Changed\n-
  Export `Get`, `Set`, `Destroy`, `Members` by default\n- Export `cfold`, `cfoldM`,
  `cfoldM_` by default\n- Fix () instance\n\n## [0.4.1.0]\n### Added\n- `cfold`, `cfoldM`,
  `cfoldM_`\n- `Either` instances and `EitherStore`\n\n### Changed\n- Changed MaybeStore
  implementation to no longer use -1 for missing entities.\n- Fixed some outdated
  documentation.\n- Change the `global` void entity to -2, just to be sure it won't
  conflict if accidentally used in a cache.\n\n## [0.4.0.0]\n### Added\n- A changelog\n\n###
  Changed\n- `Store` is now split into 5 separate type classes; `ExplInit`, `ExplGet`,
  `ExplSet`, `ExplDestroy`, and `ExplMembers`.\n    This makes it illegal to e.g.
  iterate over a `Not`.\n- phantom arguments are now given as `Proxy` values, re-exported
  from `Data.Proxy`. This makes phantom arguments explicit and avoids undefined values.\n"

  # apecs

  apecs is an [_Entity Component System_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) (ECS) library for game development.

  apecs aims to be
  * **Fast** - Performance is competitive with Rust ECS libraries (see benchmark results below)
  * **Safe** - Completely hides the dangers of the low-level machinery
  * **Concise** - Game logic is expressed using a small number of powerful combinators
  * **Flexible** - Easily add new modules or backends
  * **Cool**
