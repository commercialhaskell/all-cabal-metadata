  # Haskell client for Accumulate

  A JSON-RPC Haskell client for the Factom protocol. Each response has special ADT(algebraic data type) that automatically converted from JSON response. Using [Remote Monad](https://ku-fpg.github.io/files/Gill-15-RemoteMonad.pdf) pattern multiple request can be batched and executed simulatenously, following more robust approach and reducing usage of expensive RPC calls.

  Choosing a batching strategy. There are two strategies:
  - `Weak`   - a single command or a single procedure, or
  - `Strong` - a sequence of commands, optionally terminated by a procedure

  # Installation

  You can install package from [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/api-rpc-accumulate) and build with Cabal, but we recommend to use [Stack](https://haskellstack.org) tool. Add to you dependencies in stack.yaml and cabal file dependency `- api-rpc-accumulate`.

  To run and test from repository

  1. Build with stack
  ```bash
  $ stack build
  ```
  2. Load REPL with stack for evaluation
  ```
  $ stack repl
  ```

  3. execute required methods
