  A `Data.Map` wrapper with a `Semigroup` and `Monoid` instances that delegate to
  the individual keys.

  ```haskell
  import qualified Data.Map as Map
  import Data.Map.Append

  > one = AppendMap $ Map.fromList [(1, "hello"), (2, "goodbye")]
  > two = AppendMap $ Map.fromList [(1, "world"), (3, "again")]

  > unAppendMap (one <> two)
  fromList [(1, "helloworld"), (2, "goodbye"), (3, "again")]
  ```

  ## Motivation

  `Data.Map` has a `Semigroup` instance that keeps the values from the first
  argument in case of a key conflict:

  ```haskell
  import qualified Data.Map as Map
  import Data.Map.Append

  > Map.fromList [(1, "hello")] <> Map.fromList [(1, "goodbye")]
  fromList [(1, "hello")]
  ```

  A different instance has been suggested for a long time
  ([1](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/libraries/2012-April/017743.html),
  [2](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/1460)), but this is a breaking change and hasn't happened yet (as of 2018-08).

  ## Development

  Source code is formatted with `hindent` _then_ `stylish-haskell`.

  ### Releasing

  * Run `./bumpversion patch|minor|major`. This will create a new version and push
    it to the repository to be released.
