description: |-
  A compatible re-implementation of the mnemonic used by the
  Electrum bitcoin wallet.

  Generates an easy to remember mnemonic phrase from a high entropy value
  such as a private key. Three words are sufficient to encode 128 bits
  of data.

  The word list is tuned to produce memorable and often poetic
  phrases, for example:
  - dragon image everywhere teeth cage universe
  - respect born enemy affection sometimes human
  - certain return beauty baby great art
