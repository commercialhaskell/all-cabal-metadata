description: |-
  This library provides both runtime and Template Haskell functions which let you take multi-module
  Elm Programs and compile them to JavaScript.
  The main goal of this is to allow Elm to be used as a frontend for Haskell servers or Web apps.
  The library is independent of any specific framework, so it should work with Yesod, Snap, Happstack, Scotty, etc.
