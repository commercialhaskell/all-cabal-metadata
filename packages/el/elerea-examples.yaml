description: "Example applications for Elerea. They are factored out into their own\r\npackage
  so as to avoid unnecessary dependencies in the library. Check\r\nout the doc directory
  for the colourful literate sources.\r\n\r\nThe programs included are the following:\r\n\r\n*
  bounce: an example for creating dynamic collections of signals; left\r\n  click
  to create balls, drag existing balls with left button to\r\n  propel them and drag
  with right to select balls for deletion (upon\r\n  release);\r\n\r\n* chase: a minimal
  example that demonstrates reactivity and mutually\r\n  recursive signals;\r\n\r\n*
  breakout: a not too fancy breakout clone; you can simply use the\r\n  mouse to move
  the paddle.\r\n"
