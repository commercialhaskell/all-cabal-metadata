  # Elm Server

  This is a simple server to make it easier to develop Elm projects. It lets you
  view Elm files in your browser and recompile them by refreshing the page.

  #### Install

  It comes bundled with the Elm Platform or you can install it individually with
  `cabal install elm-server`.


  #### Use

  Navigate to the Elm project you want to work on. In that directory run:

  ```bash
  elm-server
  ```

  This will start the server at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
  If you want to use a different port, use the `--port` flag (e.g. `elm-server
  --port 8080`). In your browser you can navigate through your project and see how
  each Elm page looks.

  `elm-server` will serve any kind of static content, so you can also look at HTML,
  images, JSON, or whatever else you may need to serve.
