  # Revision history for ELynx


  ## Unreleased changes


  ## Version 0.6.0.0

  -   **elynx-tree:** remove parallel folds with layers (`parBranchFoldMapWithLayer`
      too special and slow).
  -   **elynx-tree:** fix various tree instances; add zip trees with appropriate
      instances.
  -   Remove `monad-logger` dependency and implement lighter alternative.
  -   Significant changes to the tool chain.


  ## Version 0.5.1.0

  -   **elynx-tree:** new functions `isValidPath`, `isLeaf`, `depth`; add conversion
      topology -> tree; various internal algorithmic improvements; improved error
      messages; simplified interface to Newick parsers; parallel fold map; Nix
      flake.
  -   Remove unneeded dependencies.


  ## Version 0.5.0.2

  -   Speed up mixture model simulation.
  -   Improve rooting functions.
  -   Improve `Topology` data type (but still a lot to do).
  -   Various additions to the documentation.
  -   Rename `Measurable` to `HasLength`, `Supported` to `HasSupport`, and `Named`
      to `HasLength`.
  -   Cabal and stack file changes.


  ## Version 0.5.0.1

  -   `modLen`, `modSup`.
  -   Newtype wrappers for branch length, branch support, and node name. Those data
      types and some functions were also renamed.
  -   Add `Path`, and `getSubTreeUnsafe` to tree zipper.
  -   Rename `unsafe` functions so that `unsafe` is at the end.
  -   Many small changes.


  ## Version 0.4.1

  -   Improve `TimeSpec` (Point process).
  -   Parallel evaluation strategies.
  -   Change names of some functions involving partitions. For example, `mp` was
      renamed to `pt`.
  -   Improve documentation for (bi)partitions.
  -   Bugfix `tlynx compare`; do not throw error when branch support values are not
      set.
  -   Add `no-elynx-file` option.
  -   Also parse Nexus files with `tlynx` commands.
  -   Bugfix `subSample`; the sub sample was reversed.


  ## Version 0.4.0

  -   Major refactor of `elynx-tree`. All required function can now conveniently
      reexported by `ELynx.Tree`.


  ## Version 0.3.4

  -   Improve `slynx examine`; show hamming distance; show constant sites.
  -   PhyloStrict -> PhyloExplicit; and some conversion functions were changed.
  -   `tlynx coalesce` was merged into `tlynx simulate`, the syntax has changed; see
      `tlynx simulate --help`.


  ## Version 0.3.3

  -   Fix test suites.


  ## Version 0.3.2

  -   Remove llvm dependency.
  -   Move away from hpack.


  ## Version 0.3.1

  -   Use Attoparsec.
  -   Use ByteString consistently.
  -   Remove elynx-tools dependency from libaries.


  ## Version 0.3.0

  -   **`elynx-nexus`:** library to import and export Nexus files.
  -   **`elynx-tree`:** major refactor and big cleanup; use rose trees with branch
      labels.
  -   **`elynx-tree`:** provide zippers.


  ## Version 0.2.2

  -   Validation and repetition of previous analyses is finally possible with the
      new `elynx` binary.
  -   A library `elynx-markov` for running Markov processes along phylogenetic trees
      has been split off `elynx-seq`. This library performs the computations when
      executing `slynx simulate ...`.
  -   Many other small improvements.

description: "\n\n# The ELynx Suite\n\nVersion: 0.6.0.0.\nReproducible evolution made
  easy.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://travis-ci.org/dschrempf/elynx.svg?branch=master\"/></p>\n\nA
  Haskell library and tool set for computational biology. The goal of ELynx is\nreproducible
  research. Evolutionary sequences and phylogenetic trees can be\nread, viewed, modified
  and simulated. The command line with all arguments is\nlogged consistently, and
  automatically. Data integrity is verified using SHA256\nsums so that validation
  of past analyses is possible without the need to\nrecompute the result.\n\nThe Elynx
  Suite consists of library packages and executables providing a range\nof sub commands.\n\nThe
  library packages are:\n\n-   **[elynx-nexus](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/elynx-nexus):**
  Nexus file support.\n-   **[elynx-markov](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/elynx-markov):**
  Simulate multi sequence alignments along phylogenetic trees.\n-   **[elynx-seq](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/elynx-seq):**
  Handle evolutionary sequences and multi sequence alignments.\n-   **[elynx-tools](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/elynx-tools):**
  Tools for the provided executables.\n-   **[elynx-tree](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/elynx-tree):**
  Handle phylogenetic trees.\n\nThe executables are:\n\n-   **[slynx](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/slynx):**
  Analyze, modify, and simulate evolutionary sequences.\n-   **[tlynx](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tlynx):**
  Analyze, modify, and simulate phylogenetic trees.\n-   **[elynx](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/elynx):**
  Validate and redo past analyses.\n\nDocumentation is available on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/)
  (use direct links above).\n\n**ELynx is actively developed. We happily receive comments,
  ideas, feature\nrequests, and pull requests!**\n\n\n# Installation\n\nELynx is written
  in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and can be installed with [cabal-install](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/3.4/cabal-commands.html)
  or [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).\n\n1.  Install Stack
  with your package manager, or directly from the web\n    page.\n    \n        curl
  -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh\n\n2.  Clone the ELynx repository.\n    \n
  \       git clone https://github.com/dschrempf/elynx\n\n3.  Navigate to the newly
  created `elynx` folder and build the binaries.\n    This will take a while.\n    \n
  \       stack build\n\n4.  Run a binary from within the project directory. For example,\n
  \   \n        stack exec tlynx -- --help\n\n5.  If needed, install the binaries.\n
  \   \n        stack install\n    \n    The binaries are installed into `~/.local/bin/`
  which has to be added to the\n    [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable))
  environment variable. Then, they can be used directly.\n\n\n# Get help\n\nFor example:\n\n

  \      Supported Protein models: Poisson, Poisson-Custom, LG, LG-Custom, WAG, WAG-Custom,
  GTR20.\n         MODEL-Custom means that only the exchangeabilities of MODEL are

  \             the 'e_XY' are the exchangeabilities from amino acid X to Y (alphabetical
  order).\n       Notes: The F81 model for DNA is equivalent to the Poisson-Custom
  for proteins.\n              The GTR4 model for DNA is equivalent to the GTR20 for
  proteins.\n    \n    Mixture models:\n    -m \"MIXTURE(SUBSTITUTION_MODEL_1,SUBSTITUTION_MODEL_2[PARAMETERS]{STATIONARY_DISTRIBUTION},...)\"\n
  \      For example,\n         -m \"MIXTURE(JC,HKY[6.0]{0.3,0.2,0.2,0.3})\"\n    Mixture
  weights have to be provided with the -w option.\n    \n    Special mixture models:\n
  \   -m CXX\n       where XX is 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, or 60; CXX models, Quang et al.,
  2008.\n    -m \"EDM(EXCHANGEABILITIES)\"\n       Arbitrary empirical distribution
  mixture (EDM) models.\n       Stationary distributions have to be provided with
  the -e or -p option.\n       For example,\n         LG exchangeabilities with stationary
  distributions given in FILE.\n         -m \"EDM(LG-Custom)\" -e FILE\n         LG
  exchangeabilities with site profiles (Phylobayes) given in FILES.\n         -m \"EDM(LG-Custom)\"
  -p FILES\n    For special mixture models, mixture weights are optional.\n\n"
