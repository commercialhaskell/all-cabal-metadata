description: |-
  A simple library, which contains an interface for generating fresh values.

  This library also includes two functor transformers which implement this
  interface. They consume fresh values from user-supplied comonads.
  Currently, two approaches are implemented:

  * In @Stream@, the comonad provides a way to succeed a value.

  * In @Delta@, the comonad provides a way to split the value or to succeeded
  it. The benefit is that the underlying functor doesn't need to be a monad.
