  daemonize-doublefork
  ====================

  > Start background Haskell daemons by double-forking

  Deprecated
  ----------

  This package has been deprecated in favour of
  [daemons](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/daemons).

  What
  ----

  This module provides `startDaemon` and `stopDaemon` to facilitate the
  creation of Haskell daemon programs.

  The problem is as follows: the user starts a program in their
  terminal, but he wants the program to relinquish control of the
  terminal immediately, and furthermore, the program (or part of it)
  should keep running even after said terminal is closed.  Examples of
  programs that behave like this are `nginx` and `emacs --daemon`.

  The correct solution is to double-fork a process.  This ensures
  that the child process is completed separated from the terminal it
  was started on.

  See this [page](http://www.enderunix.org/docs/eng/daemon.php) for a
  discussion on double-forking.

  See the
  [Hackage page](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/daemonize-doublefork)
  for documentation and examples.
