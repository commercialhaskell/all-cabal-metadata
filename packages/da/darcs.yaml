changelog: "Darcs 2.18.2, 24 Mar 2024\n\n  * Fix deprecated head/tail warnings on
  GHC 9.8, making the build there\n    warning-free.\n\n  * Replace the set-default
  hint that was removed in 2.18.1\n\n  * Add a --ghcflags/-g option to the test suite
  to allow flags\n    like -dynamic to be passed to GHC when it builds helper exes\n
  \   in various test scripts.\n\nDarcs 2.18.1, 25 Feb 2024\n\n  * Supports GHC 9.8
  and the most recent version of other dependencies\n    at the time of release, with
  the exception of the tls 2.0 package,\n    which has been held back because of problems
  connecting to hub.darcs.net\n    (see https://bugs.darcs.net/issue2715).\n\n  *
  Substantial rewrite of the 'darcs test' command.\n\n    The most important user
  visible change is that a test script can now\n    return an exit code of 125 to
  reflect an untestable/skipped state\n    (as with with \"git bisect run\").\n\n
  \   This in turn means that a group of patches can be found to be responsible\n
  \   for a failure rather than just a single one. By default, Darcs will\n    try
  to minimise such a group by reordering patches to remove irrelevant\n    ones from
  the initial group found from the patch ordering in the\n    repository. This behaviour
  can be disabled with --no-shrink-failure.\n\n  * Remove support for downloading
  via curl\n\n    This is no longer particularly useful as we now use modern, maintained\n
  \   Haskell libraries for native HTTP downloading, and substantially simplifies\n
  \   this area of the code.\n\n  * Patch index: Significant performance improvement\n\n
  \   The patch index is used in commands like annotate and log. A couple of\n    performance
  improvements were made that should speed up using the patch\n    index.\n\n  * Progress
  reporting\n\n    Progress reports are now provided during more long-running operations,\n
  \   including updating the \"index\" (a cache that speeds up detecting\n    changes
  in the working directory), and during merge operations.\n\n    They also behave
  better on Windows and when outputting long lines.\n\n  * Other changes/fixes:\n
  \   * Use hardlinks more often to share files between repositories/caches.\n    *
  Support --leave-test-dir for all commands that support --test\n    * Avoid extraneous
  \"repo:.\" entries in _darcs/prefs/sources [issue2672]\n    * Add 'darcs clean'
  command as an alias for 'darcs revert -l'\n    * 'darcs rebase unsuspend': add more
  patch editing options\n    * Fix stale lock files after Ctrl-C\n    * External merge
  tools: preserve output, and fail if tool does\n    * Properly reference renamed
  files in external merge [issue189]\n    * Mark conflicts properly if tag pulled
  at the same time [issue2682]\n    * Remove the useless optimize pristine subcommand\n
  \   * 'darcs convert': honour the --compress and --diff-algorithm options\n    *
  Fix contrib/darcs-shell [issue2646]\n    * Fix 'darcs pull --dont-allow-conflicts'
  with external-merge [issue1819]\n    * Problems with local pristine files now tell
  user to run\n      'darcs repair' [issue1981]\n    * Fix various problems with symlinks,
  including on Windows\n    * Add --no-prefs-templates option when creating a repository\n
  \   * Allow 'darcs rebase unsuspend' when there are non-conflicting\n      unrecorded
  changes\n    * Handle broken pending patches in 'darcs check' and 'darcs repair'\n
  \   * Improve error reporting when remote _darcs/format doesn't exist\n    * 'darcs
  optimize reorder': add --deep/--shallow options\n    * 'darcs optimize compress/uncompress':
  also handle pristine files\n    * 'darcs optimize cache': don't work with lists
  of darcs repos\n      Instead just the global cache is cleaned by checking hard-link
  counts\n    * Skip the pager when $DARCS_PAGER / $PAGER are set to the empty string\n
  \   * 'darcs convert export': allow relative paths for --read-marks and\n      --write-marks\n
  \   * Fix 'darcs amend --unrecord' to move unrecorded changes to pending\n      [issue2697]\n
  \   * Don't treat cancelling an operation as failure [issue2074]\n    * Fix cloning
  of ssh repo when using Ctrl-C to stop getting patches\n      [issue2701]\n    *
  Don't report invalid regexes as a bug in darcs [issue2702]\n    * Add short option
  -n for --dry-run\n    * 'darcs diff': support --look-for-moves and --look-for-adds\n
  \   * Fix buffering problem with 'darcs diff' [issue2704]\n    * 'darcs obliterate'
  and 'darcs rebase': offer to revert any conflicting\n      unrecorded changes\n
  \   * Stop displaying context lines in various interactive scenarios:\n      it
  didn't work properly and would require a lot of work to fix.\n    * Improve conflict
  display for Rebase and V3 patches\n    * Increase size limit to 100K for environment
  variables like\n      DARCS_PATCHES_XML, and warn when it is exceeded\n    * 'darcs
  rebase unsuspend': improve the display of dropped dependencies\n    * 'darcs amend
  --ask-deps': also provide a way to remove dependencies\n    * 'darcs push': support
  --reorder-patches option\n    * Remove the --remote-repo option\n    * Don't display
  hints about using --set-default\n    * Conflict resolution: unrecorded changes will
  suppress conflict marking\n      of appropriate changes [issue2708]\n    * Explain
  what a \"clean tag\" is in help for tag command\n    * Fix problem with naming patch
  bundles after patches that contain\n      characters incompatible with the current
  locale [issue2716]\n\nDarcs 2.16.5, 20 Feb 2022\n\n  This release is to support
  newer dependencies, most importantly\n  GHC 9.0 and Cabal 3.6.\n\n  It also includes
  a small number of refactors that help with moving\n  to those newer dependencies.\n\nDarcs
  2.16.4, 20 May 2021\n\n  This release is mostly to fix http://bugs.darcs.net/issue2674
  which can\n  lead to repository corruption. This is not quite as bad as it sounds,\n
  \ since the broken changes that you could have recorded were consistently\n  ignored
  when applying the patch. This bug has been in darcs for a very\n  long time and
  even our own repos contain (ancient) patches with broken\n  move changes, and so
  far it hasn't caused us any trouble.\n\n  That said, there are certain patch commutations
  that will erroneously (and\n  unexpectedly) fail when such a patch is involved.
  We therefore recommend\n  to upgrade. You may also (after upgrading) run 'darcs
  check' on your\n  repositories to see if you are affected, and 'darcs repair' them
  if that\n  is the case. Fortunately, the broken move changes can be safely eliminated\n
  \ from existing patches, and the improved repair command now does exactly\n  that.\n\n
  \ Thanks to lemming@henning-thielemann.de for bringing this bug to our\n  attention.\n\n
  \ * resolve issue2674: moving unadded files\n  * add a check/repair rule for bad
  move patches\n    This drops a move patch with either non-existing source or existing
  target.\n\n  Also related to issue2674:\n\n  * improve error message when runDefault
  fails due to an IO error\n  * remove catching of exceptions for bad moves in DefaultIO\n
  \ * fail in Darcs.Util.Tree.Monad.rename if source does not exist\n  * test that
  we cannot record patches that depend on broken moves\n\n  The rest of the changes
  are minor bug fixes plus a few dependencies.\n\n  * resolve issue2670: convert \".\"
  to absolute path when creating a repo\n    This bug was introduced by fix for issue2668.\n
  \ * resolve issue2668: createDirectory: permission denied\n  * resolve issue2667:
  darcs init failed with permission denied\n  * bugfix: --leave-test-dir should be
  off by default\n  * bash_completion: use '--list-options' before any other option\n
  \   This is so to avoid that, e.g.:\n    $ darcs record -m <Tab><Tab>\n    results
  in a patch named '--list-options' being recorded.\n  * zsh completion: use '--list-options'
  before any other option\n    See the corresponding change in the bash completion
  for details.\n  * zsh completion: improve the get/clone case\n    Moving the special
  case for get/clone down into the catch-all case for the\n    current word allows
  it to complete options and local paths.\n  * bugfix: --leave-test-dir should be
  off by default\n  * bugfix in readPendingAndMovesAndUnrecorded\n  * print patch
  application warnings to stderr, not stdout\n\nDarcs 2.16.3, 22 October 2020\n\n
  \ * Fix building with `-f curl` (issue2655)\n  * Fix building with stack\n  * Various
  fixes in our custom Setup.hs, mostly to do with cabal commands\n    exectuted inside
  the unpacked source dist tar ball\n  * Remove obsolete dependency on split package\n
  \ * Remove dependency on sandi and use base16-bytestring >= 1.0, improving\n    performance
  when darcs handles binary files and patches, and more\n    generally whenever we
  convert hashes from/to text.\n  * Various minor fixes and additions to tests scripts\n
  \ * Issues fixed:\n    * 2654: amend --prompt-long-comment removes the long comment\n
  \   * 2658: show dependencies should only show direct dependencies\n    * 2659:
  check for bad patch name after invoking editor, too\n\nDarcs 2.16.2, 19 August 2020\n\n
  \ * Fix build problem when using 'cabal install' from inside the sdist.\n\n    This
  fails because in this case cabal will try to 'cabal sdist' the\n    bundled shelly
  dependency, and we do not (nor want to) list all shelly\n    files in our own cabal
  file. To avoid problems like this, we no longer\n    use the bundled shelly as a
  dependency, but rather as part of our\n    sources for the test suite.\n\nDarcs
  2.16.1, 14 August 2020\n\n  * Building:\n    * Drop support for building with ghc-8.0\n
  \   * Allow clean (warning-free) builds with all ghc versions from 8.2.2 up\n      to
  ghc-8.10.1\n    * Various dependency updates\n    * Remove sdist and postConf hooks
  from Setup.hs\n    * move -DHAVE_MAPI from Setup.hs to darcs.cabal\n    * Recommended
  way to build is using cabal-install >= 3.0\n    * The source tree now contains a
  cleaned-up version of shelly-1.7.1\n      (locally named shelly-1.7.1.1) which we
  need to run our test suite.\n      Unfortunately, later versions break compatibility
  on Windows and\n      keeping the dependency fixed to 1.7.1 would mean we cannot
  support\n      newer ghc versions.\n\n  * Preliminary UNSTABLE support for a new
  patch theory named \"darcs-3\",\n    largely based on the pioneering work of Ian
  Lynagh for 'camp'.\n\n    Please note that this format is not yet officially supported:
  some\n    features (like conversion from older formats) are still missing, and we\n
  \   have not yet finalized the on-disk format. You should NOT use it for any\n    serious
  work yet.\n\n    The new theory finally solves all the well-known consistency problems\n
  \   that plagued the earlier ones, and thus fixes a number of issues\n    (including
  issue1401 and issue2605) that have been outstanding for many\n    years. It also
  reduces the worst case asymptotic runtime for commutation\n    and merging from
  exponential to merely quadratic in the number of\n    patches involved.\n\n    One
  of the reasons we are confident this new theory and its\n    implementation is sound,
  i.e. respect all required properties, is that\n    we have improved our test case
  generator for sequences of patches. It\n    now generates all possible conflict
  scenarios. Since the new theory no\n    longer has worst case exponential runtime,
  we can and did test all\n    required properties and invariants with a large number
  of generated test\n    cases (up to 100000).\n\n  * The internals of how 'darcs
  rebase' stores and handles suspended patches\n    and their \"fixups\" has been
  changed in incompatible ways. This means\n    that if you have a rebase in progress
  started with darcs < 2.16, you\n    will first need to use the new 'darcs rebase
  upgrade' command to upgrade\n    the suspended patches to the new format. If you
  start a rebase with\n    darcs-2.16, then earlier darcs versions will not work with
  that repo,\n    until you have finished the rebase.\n\n    The new implementation
  fixes a lot of bugs (including outright crashes\n    in some situations). The behavior
  when conflicted patches are suspended\n    is much better now, though there are
  still a few corner cases where the\n    behavior can be quite unintuitive, especially
  when complicated conflicts\n    are suspended.\n\n    A number of limitations regarding
  repositories with a rebase in progress\n    have been lifted; in particular, push,
  pull, and clone between repos can\n    now be done regardless of whether any of
  the repos have a rebase in\n    progress or not.\n\n  * The way conflict markup
  is generated has been cleaned up and refactored.\n    The main user-visible improvement
  is that darcs now reliably /either/\n    marks a conflict /or/ keeps the default
  resolution (i.e. remove both\n    changes) and reports the conflicts that it cannot
  mark. Previously,\n    conflicts that could not be properly marked (roughly all
  conflicts\n    involving changes other than hunks, e.g. replaces and file or dir
  adds,\n    removes, and renames) would be silently \"half-resolved\" in favour of
  one\n    of the alternatives. This could be pretty confusing, the more so since\n
  \   it was hard to predict which of the conflicting alternatives was chosen.\n\n
  \ * Complete re-implementation of the way in which the pending patch is\n    updated
  after record and amend. This fixes a number of problems with\n    pending becoming
  corrupt. The new code also works in cases where hunks\n    are edited interactively.
  The algorithm is documented in detail.\n\n  * Downloading files via http now uses
  the http-conduit package. This is\n    now the default method when building darcs.
  Building against the curl\n    library is still supported but you have to explicitly
  request it by\n    passing -fcurl to cabal.\n\n  * Reworked internal failure handling
  so we can clearly distinguish between\n    normal command failures and internal
  errors, i.e bugs, in darcs. In case\n    of a bug, darcs exits with status 4 and
  prints a message that asks the\n    user to report it and how to do that.\n\n  *
  During interactive patch selection, the 'x', 'v', and 'p' keys no longer\n    print
  the patch description (if any), only the summary or the patch\n    content. A new
  key 'r' was added to re-display the currently selected\n    patch in default mode
  (normally this is just the description). See\n    issue2649 for details.\n\n  *
  A large number of other internal refactors and code cleanups.\n\n  * A forward compatibility
  bug (issue2650), roughly fixed in Darcs 2.14.5,\n    is now resolved in full. In
  particular, we modify the format file only\n    if we have taken the repo lock,
  silently fix possibly corrupted entries\n    when reading the format file, internally
  document the forward\n    compatibility rules, and finally test them more thoroughly.\n\n
  \ * Issues fixed:\n    * 1316: amend-record: files/dirs still in pending even if
  they are removed\n    * 1609: darcs conflict marking gives different results in
  different orders\n    * 2001: repair fails to detect missing pristine files\n    *
  2275: ignore symlinks as repo paths even when the index is used\n    * 2404: darcs
  convert export ignores --repodir\n    * 2441: Use pager for darcs annotate\n    *
  2445: internal error if suspended patch is pulled into repository again\n    * 2454:
  help markdown/manpage should use a pager\n    * 2533: add umask option to all commands
  that modify the repo\n    * 2536: show files --no-files: can't mix match and pending
  flags\n    * 2548: inconsistent pending after addfile f; rm f; mkdir f\n    * 2550:
  apply only properly mangled resolutions, warn about any others\n    * 2592: update
  pending with coalesced look-for changes\n    * 2593: network test can collide with
  shell tests\n    * 2594: darcs show index crashes replace with unrecorded force
  hunk\n    * 2599: don't bother to update pending when cloning a repo\n    * 2603:
  warn and mark conflicts when cloning\n    * 2604: remove --reply and related options\n
  \   * 2608: download _darcs/hashed_inventory separately\n    * 2610: add --inherit-default
  option\n    * 2614: (an intermediate regression)\n    * 2618: option --ask-deps
  adds too many dependencies\n    * 2625: catch only IO exceptions from applyToWorking\n
  \   * 2626: treat applyToWorking more uniformly\n    * 2634: use unwind to suspend
  patches\n    * 2635: build/install man page only if we build darcs executable\n
  \   * 2639: darcs diff crashes with --last=1 and file name\n    * 2645: search for
  \":\" to detect ssh URLs only up to the first \"/\"\n    * 2648: convert import
  with non-ASCII meta data and filepaths\n    * 2649: cleanup display of patches\n\n
  \ * Partial fixes:\n    * 1959: read-only commands should not need write access
  to the index\n      This is mostly fixed, see tests/issue1959-unwritable-darcsdir.sh\n
  \     for the few remaining problematic cases. We also now check\n      writability
  of the index when we start a transaction.\n\n  * Miscellaneous user-visible changes
  and bugfixes:\n    * always prompt for confirmation when there are conflicts with
  unrecorded\n      changes\n    * darcs optimize upgrade: don't throw away pending\n
  \   * use cryptonite instead of cryptohash and random; the random junk added\n      to
  patch meta data now uses a cryptographically secure random number\n      generator;
  also replaces our own implementation of SHA1\n    * darcs repair: handle broken
  binary patches\n    * fail if pending patch cannot be parsed instead of silently
  ignoring it\n    * darcs remove: don't allow removal of root\n    * darcs suspend
  reify: give reified fixup patches a real author\n    * darcs add: fail unconditionally
  when no files were added\n    * darcs optimize compress: don't compress special
  patches such as\n      pending or unrevert\n    * darcs send: bugfix on Windows
  with GHC>=8.6\n    * fix prompting when we get a bad patch name from the user\n
  \   * darcs apply: fix interpretation of patch bundles as patchsets when the\n      context
  tag is not in our repo\n    * darcs apply: fix lazy reading of inventories\n    *
  darcs amend: fix editing of tag names\n    * clone to ssh: don't overwrite existing
  remote target directories\n    * darcs rebase: remove error if no suspended patches
  found\n    * fully respect the (badly named) --no-ignore-times option (which\n      actually
  means to ignore the index)\n    * replace the code for creating unique temporary
  directory names\n      (that was prone to race conditions); instead we now use the
  temporary\n      package\n    * darcs check/repair: detect and repair missing (hashed)
  pristine files\n    * remove option --restrict-paths (is always active now)\n    *
  remove defunct --set-default option for rebase pull\n    * remove env var DARCS_DO_COLOR_LINES\n
  \   * demote errors in defaults file and commandline to warnings\n    * add --not-in-remote
  option to amend and rebase suspend; the option\n      is now supported by all history
  editing commands.\n    * remove our own optimisation settings in darcs.cabal\n    *
  regard explicit dependencies as resolving conflicts\n    * suspend reify: give reified
  fixup patches a real author\n    * never overwrite existing files with -O/--output-auto-name\n
  \   * make working with temporary directories more robust\n    * make sure we cancel
  pending download actions at exit\n    * darcs diff: allow use of interactive external
  diff commands\n    * remove graphviz dependency by re-implementing show dependencies\n
  \   * darcs show dependencies: review matching options\n    * darcs annotate: more
  than one file argument is now an error\n\n  * Changes in the output of commands:\n
  \   * add a warning when the index code ignores a symlink\n    * print remote execution
  failure message to stderr\n    * darcs amend: respect verbosity options\n    * commands
  that can produce large amounts of output now display it using\n      a pager, similar
  to 'darcs log'\n    * remove \"withSignalsHandled:\" from message when we are interrupted
  (Ctrl-C)\n    * add progress reporting to patch index\n    * print remote execution
  failure message to stderr\n    * re-formulate the bad sources hint\n    * remove
  hint \"Do you have the right URI for the repository?\"\n    * remove the \"darcs

  description\n\nDarcs 2.14.5, 6 August 2020\n\n  * Resolve issue2650\n\n    This
  is a stupid and rather unfortunate bug that affects all previous\n    versions of
  the 2.12 and 2.14 branch. It can lead to corruption of the\n    _darcs/format file
  in repos where *future* darcs versions add an\n    alternative format property.
  The bug affects commands rebase suspend,\n    rebase pull, and rebase apply.\n\n
  \   It is possible to manually fix the corruption by deleting from\n    _darcs/format
  strings of the form \"Unknown property: \". Future releases\n    will contain a
  work-around that automatically fixes this particular kind\n    of corruption when
  reading the format file, in case it should ever\n    happen in practice. Nevertheless
  we strongly recommend to upgrade and\n    avoid using the darcs versions affected
  by this bug.\n\nDarcs 2.14.4, 28 April 2020\n\n  * Restored the ability to run our
  shell tests, at least when building\n    directly from a clone of our darcs repo.
  This was done by importing an\n    old version of shelly (1.7.1, the last that worked
  for us on Windows),\n    so that (modern) cabal picks that version instead of the
  newest one from\n    hackage. Then made it build with all supported ghc versions
  and fixed\n    all warnings.\n  * Fix the quick-and-dirty \"solutions\" to the MonadFail
  incompatibility\n    that replaced fail with error to avoid cascading MonadFail
  requirements\n    all over the place. This broke a number of our tests, proving
  it to be\n    semantically unsound, as I had expected. In most cases the correct\n
  \   solution was to replace it with (throw . userError), or if possible with\n    (liftIO
  . fail).\n\nDarcs 2.14.3, 24 April 2020\n\n  * Support for GHC 8.8 and GHC 8.10\n

  apply\". (issue1350)\n   * \"darcs send\" now tries to report the right character
  set in the email headers, and has the option --charset to override this.\n   * A
  new environment variable has been added to help control network connections: DARCS\\_CONNECTION\\_TIMEOUT.

  Roundy)\n\n  * New Feature: Accept an optional directory argument in darcs send\n
  \   --output-auto-name (Dmitry Kurochkin)\n\n  * User Experience: New --no-cache
  option to help debug network issues\n    (issue1054, Dmitry Kurochkin)\n\n  * Performance:
  New --http-pipelining and --no-http-pipelining flags. Passing\n    --http-pipelining
  to darcs can make darcs get and pull faster over HTTP.\n    Due to a libcurl bug,
  this is not the default option unless darcs is\n    compiled with libcurl 7.19.1,
  due 2008-11. (Dmitry Kurochkin)\n\n  * Bug Fix: Eliminate hanging and crashes while
  fetching files over HTTP\n    (issue920, issue977, issue996, issue1037, Dmitry Kurochkin)\n\n
  \ * Security: Fix some insecure uses of printfs in darcs.cgi (Steve Cotton)\n\n
  \ * Bug Fix: Handle filepaths in a simpler and more robust fashion. This fixes\n
  \   relative filepaths and recognition of symbolic links and avoids possible\n    future
  bugs (issue950, issue1057, David Roundy, Dmitry Kurochkin)\n\n  * Bug Fix: Make
  darcs diff --patch work even if the patch is within a tag\n    (issue966, darcs
  2 regression, Dmitry Kurochkin)\n\n  * Quality Assurance: Extend use of Haskell's
  GADTs to most of the darcs\n    code, fixing many potential bugs along the way (Jason
  Dagit, David Roundy)\n\n  * Quality Assurance: Several improvements to darcs code
  quality (Petr\n    Ročkai)\n\n  * Bug Fix: Correct assumptions made by darcs about
  Windows file size types\n    (issue1015, Simon Marlow, Ganesh Sittampalam)\n\n  *
  Bug Fix: Support case insensitive file systems using hashed repositories\n    in
  darcs repair (partial issue971, Petr Ročkai). IMPORTANT: This\n    introduces a
  memory use regression, which affects large repositories. We\n    found that doing
  a darcs repair on the GHC repository requires a machine\n    with 2 GB of RAM. The
  regression is well-understood and should be solved\n    in the next darcs release.
  In the meantime we felt that the improved\n    robustness was worth the performance
  trade-off.\n\n  * Quality Assurance: Simplify building darcs on Windows by optionally
  using\n    the zlib and terminfo Haskell packages (Ganesh Sittampalam, Petr Ročkai)\n\n
  \ * User Experience: Better error reporting when patches that should commute\n    fail
  to do so. (Jason Dagit)\n\n  * New Feature: --match \"touch filenames\", for example
  --match 'touch\n    foo|bar|splotz.*(c|h)' (issue115, Dmitry Kurochkin)\n\n  * User
  Experience: Improve debugging and error messages in HTTP code (Dmitry\n    Kurochkin,
  David Roundy)\n\n  * Bug Fix: Ensure that darcs responds to Ctrl-C on Window, even
  if compiled\n    with GHC < 6.10 (issue1016, Simon Marlow)\n\n  * New Feature: darcs
  changes --context now also works with --human-readable\n    and --xml-output (issue995,

  flag were used\n    (was implemented in 2.0.2, but not consistently) (David Roundy)\n\n
  \ * Bug Fix: Make sure that darcs get --tag works even when the user hits\n    Ctrl-C
  to get a lazy repository (Dmitry Kurochkin)\n\n  * Quality Assurance: Improvements
  to documentation and online help, most\n    crucially, user-focused help on upgrading
  to darcs 2. (Trent Buck, Lele\n    Gaifax, Simon Michael, Max Battcher)\n\n  * New
  Feature: darcs changes --number associates each patch with number,\n    counting
  backwards (see the --index feature) (David Roundy)\n\n  * New Feature: ability to
  match patches on index, for example, darcs changes\n    --index=3-6 shows the last
  three to six patches (David Roundy)\n\n  * User Experience: slightly reduce the

  has already successfully updated\n    the inventory and the pristine cache, so the
  repository itself is not\n    corrupted. However, an incomplete update to the working
  directory results\n    in unintended differences between the working and pristine
  tree, looking\n    like spurious unrecorded changes. These can be easily removed
  with 'darcs\n    revert', but spurious changes have to be manually sorted out from
  real\n    unrecorded changes. By darcs no longer quiting at the first problem, more\n

  (1.0.4)\n\n  * Fixed a bug in the external conflict resolution code. (bug #577,
  David\n    Roundy)\n\n  * Fixed a bug which made apply sometimes (but rarely) fail
  to check the the\n    hash on patch bundles corrupted in just the wrong way. (David
  Roundy)\n\n  * Added a simple check to darcs replace that avoids tokenizing lines
  that\n    don't contain the token we're replacing. I feel a bit bad about\n    introducing
  an optimization this late in the release cycle, but it makes a\n    huge difference,
  and really should be safe. (David Roundy---famous last\n    words)\n\n  * Fixed
  bug where darcs didn't honor the SSH_PORT environment variable when\n    calling
  sftp. (bug #576, fix suggested by Nicolas Frisby)\n\n  * Avoid putting a wrongly-named
  directory in the tarball generated by darcs\n    dist, if the name we wanted already
  exists in $TMPDIR. (Simon McVittie)\n\n  * Fixed bug which caused \"pull_firsts_middles
  called badly\" errors when\n    running record with --ask-deps flag. (bug #476,
  David Roundy)\n\n  * Fixed bug where 'darcs changes --context' created a context
  that contained\n    escapes that prevented its use with send. (bug #544, David Roundy)\n\n
  \ * Make interactive push/pull/send/apply respect the --summary option by\n    printing
  each patch as if you had hit 'x'. (David Roundy, bug #512)\n\n  * Fix bug when calling
  whatsnew --summary when a file without a trailing\n    newline has been deleted.
  (David Roundy)\n\n  * Fix --set-scripts-executable to work again. This feature had
  been broken\n    since version 1.0.3. (David Roundy)\n\n  * Simple (safe) fix for
  a bug which caused darcs to run out of file\n    descriptors when pulling over 1000
  patches. (David Roundy)\n\n  * Fix bug in perl parts of test suite which led to
  spurious warning\n    messages. (David Roundy)\n\n  * Fix bug in configure when
  compiling darcs from tarball on a system that\n    has no darcs present. (David

  \ * Made repair able to work on partial repositories. (fixes bug #189)\n\n  * Changed
  the delimiter in the long-comment file from ***DARCS*** to ***END\n    OF DESCRIPTION***
  and clarified its meaning a bit. (Jason Dagit and David\n    Roundy)\n\n  * Added
  code to allow darcs to apply some patch bundles that have had\n    carriage returns
  added to their line endings. (David Roundy, bug #291)\n\n  * Make darcs accept command
  line flags in any order, rather than requiring\n    that they precede file, directory
  or repository arguments. Fixes bug #477\n    (David Roundy)\n\n  * Modified darcs
  get to display patch numbers rather than a bunch of dots\n    while applying patches
  during a darcs get. Also added similar feedback to\n    the check and repair commands.
  (Mat Lavin, bug #212)\n\n  * Made revert --all not ask for confirmation, so it can
  be used in\n    scripting, as one would use pull --all or record --all. (Jani Monoses)\n\n
  \ * Added file ChangeLog.README explaining how to add entries to the\n    changelog.
  (Mark Stosberg and David Roundy)\n\n  * Fixed incompatibility with somewhat older
  versions of libcurl. (Kannan\n    Goundan)\n\n  * Fixed bug that showed up when
  after editing a long comment, the long\n    comment file is empty. (David Roundy,

  (1.0.4pre2)\n\n  * (EXPERIMENTAL) Added support for reading and writing to git repositories.\n
  \   There remain efficiency issues with the handling of git merges and darcs\n    is
  not yet able to either create a new git repository, or to pull from a\n    remote
  git repository. See building darcs chapter in manual for\n    instructions on building
  darcs with git support. (Juliusz Chroboczek,\n    configuration contributed by Wim
  Lewis)\n\n  * Add new \"query manifest\" command to list files and/or directories
  in\n    repository. Add some related infrastucture to support \"subcommands\".\n
  \   (Florian Weimer)\n\n  * Make configure properly detect that we're on windows
  when building under\n    mingw. (David Roundy)\n\n  * Fixed bug #208: error when
  specifying pulling from a relative default\n    repository if we are ourselves within
  a subdirectory of our repository.\n    (David Roundy)\n\n  * Change internal mechanism
  for writing the \"pending\" file to be (hopefully)\n    more robust. (David Roundy,
  original idea by Ian Lynagh)\n\n  * Fixed a bug that caused get --partial to fail
  sometimes. (David Roundy)\n\n  * Made push/pull --verbose --dry-run now display
  contents of patches,\n    analogous to the behavior of changes --verbose. (Jim Radford)\n\n
  \ * Various build system cleanups. (Peter Simons)\n\n -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>
  \ Sun, 31 Jul 2005 12:10:29 GMT\n\ndarcs (1.0.4pre1)\n\n  * Performance improvement:
  Several commands now read patches lazily, which\n    reduces memory usage. A test
  of 'darcs check' on the Linux kernel\n    repository showed the memory usage was
  nearly cut in half, from about 700\n    Megs to 400. Coded by David Roundy.\n\n
  \ * New feature: darcs put, the easiest way to create a remote repo, symmetric\n
  \   with 'darcs get'. Coded by Josef Svenningsson.\n\n  * Performance improvement:
  RT#222: darcs performs better on files with\n    massive changes. Coded by Benedikt
  Schmidt.\n\n  * New Feature: darcs optimize now has \"--modernize-patches\" and\n
  \   \"--reorder-patches\" flags. See the manual for details.\n\n  * Performance
  improvement: Using 'darcs diff' is now exponentially faster\n    when comparing
  specific files in the working directory to the most recent\n    copy in the repo.

  15 May 2005 08:56:17 GMT\n\ndarcs (1.0.3rc1)\n\n  * New Feature: darcs.cgi now uses
  appropriate caching headers. This will\n    make repeated calls to the same pages
  by cache-aware browsers much faste\n    in some cases. It also means that darcs.cgi
  can be usefully combined with\n    a cache-aware proxy for even better performance.
  (Will Glozer)\n\n  * New feature: more control over color and escaping in printed
  patches,\n    alternative color scheme, escaping of trailing spaces (Tommy Pettersson)\n\n
  \ * Fixed: fixed bug manifesting with failed createDirectory (David Roundy)\n\n
  \ * Internals: RT#255, several welcome refactors were made to the test suite,\n
  \   including comprehensible shell test script output, improved portability,\n    and
  easier maintenance. (Michael Schwern).\n\n  * New Feature: RT#245: Using --look-for-adds
  with 'whatsnew' implies\n    --summary. This should save some typing for the common
  case. (Karel\n    Gardas, Mark Stosberg)\n\n  * New Feature: RT#231: darcs gives
  better feedback now if you try to record\n    nonexistent files or directories.
  (Karel Gardas, Mark Stosberg)\n\n  * New feature: send accepts --sendmail-command
  that allows to customize the\n    command used for sending patch bundles (Benedikt
  Schmidt)\n\n  * Fixed: RT#266: Adding a non-existent dir and file gives the expected\n
  \   message now. (Tomasz Zielonka).\n\n  * Fixed: RT#10, a missed conflict resolution
  case. More accurately, we\n    noticed at had been fixed some point. A regression
  test for it was added.\n    (Tomasz Zielonka, Mark Stosberg)\n\n  * New feature:
  darcs tag can now accept the tag name on the command line\n    (RT#143). (Josef
  Svenningsson, Mark Stosberg, David Roundy)\n\n  * New feature: unrecord and unpull
  have a more powerful interface similar to\n    'darcs pull'. This allows for multiple
  patch selection. Coded by Tommy\n    Pettersson.\n\n  * Bug fix: RT#305: Removed
  '--patch' from the 'changes', which conflicted\n    with the new '--patches' option.\n\n
  \ * New feature: Automatically add parent directories for darcs add. (RT#20)\n    Coded
  by Benedikt Schmidt.\n\n  * Add helpful diagnostic message when there is a failure

  changes to a nonexistent file in a\n    subdirectory would show the patch that created

  actions that will make\n    unrevert impossible should warn the user.\n  * Fixed
  bug when moving files or directories to the root directory of\n    repo.\n  * Various
  changes to make the --logfile way of specifying the patch name\n    and comments
  in record more friendly:\n    - Allows editing of the long comment even when --logfile
  is specified,\n      if the --edit-long-comment option is also used.\n    - When
  editing the long comment, the change summary is included below\n      the actual
  text for reference, and the patch name is included in the\n      first line (and
  thus may be modified).\n    - The --logfile option is ignored if such a file doesn't
  exist.\n    - A --delete-logfile option was added, which tells darcs to delete the\n
  \     file after doing the record.  This is intended to allow you to stick\n      a
  --logfile=foo option in your defaults without accidentally\n      recording multiple
  patches with the same comments because you forgot\n      to modify it.\n  * Fixed
  bug leading to .hi files in tarball.\n  * Made ctrl-C work under windows, but only
  \"pure\" windows consoles, not\n    in cygwin shells or mingw's rxvt (room for improvement
  here).\n  * Fixed bug that led to curl not being tried when darcs is not compiled\n
  \   with libcurl.\n  * Added an environment variable DARCS_USE_ISPRINT for people
  who use\n    non-ascii characters in their files to indicate if the haskell standard\n
  \   library \"isPrint\" function works properly on their system (which\n    depends
  on locale).\n  * Reduced the number of hunks produced by the internal diff algorithm,\n
  \   when there are multiple equivalent ways of interpreting a change.\n  * Made
  the --from-{patch,tag,match} options inclusive, and added a\n    --{patch,match}
  option to diff (which was made easier to define by the\n    inclusiveness change,
  since --patch x is now equivalent to\n    --from-patch x --to-patch x).\n  * Added
  support for a second argument to get, which specifies the name of\n    the new directory.\n\n

  \ * fix bug in applying new order patch bundles that are GPG signed.\n  * fix bug
  in diff when a tagged version was requested.\n\n -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>
  \ Sat, 12 Jun 2004 05:39:48 -0400\n\ndarcs (0.9.20)\n\n  * fix bug in darcs-createrepo.\n
  \ * add support for DARCS_SCP and DARCS_SSH environment variables.\n  * add XML
  support for --summary options of changes and annotate.\n  * better command-line
  completion on commands accepting a list of files or\n    directories.\n  * fix bug
  causing empty hunk patches to lead to failures.\n  * fix bug where --all overrode
  file choice in record.\n  * fix bug when testing patches that create subdirectories
  within subdirectories.\n  * preserve pending changes when pulling or applying.\n
  \ * give better error message in pull when patch isn't readable.\n  * allow sendEmail
  with no \"to\", just \"cc\" recipients.  This should fix\n    the trouble with trying
  to --reply to a patch coming from a push rather\n    than a send.\n\n -- David Roundy
  <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Wed,  5 May 2004 06:01:48 -0400\n\ndarcs (0.9.19)\n\n
  \ * fix bugs leading to failures in the wxhaskell interface.\n  * fix bug that caused
  darcs diff to fail.\n  * fixed bug in get that lead to _darcs/current/_darcs directories.\n
  \ * improved error reporting in several situations.\n  * fixed bug when pulling
  or pushing into an empty repo.\n  * added --summary option to changes to summarize
  the changes made in each\n    patch.\n\n -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>
  \ Fri,  9 Apr 2004 07:19:34 -0400\n\ndarcs (0.9.18)\n\n  * added support for sending
  email from windows using the MAPI interface.\n    This code attaches the patch bundle
  in base64-encoded form, which darcs\n    can't currently decode (expect that in
  the next release), but the patch\n    bundle can be manually applied if a mail program
  does the decoding.\n  * renamed \"darcs push\" to \"darcs send\" and added a new
  \"darcs push\"\n    command roughly equivalent to the old \"darcs push --and-apply\".\n
  \ * removed support for setting up a test suite by simple creating a file\n    named
  \"darcs_test\".  You now should use setpref to define the test\n    suite command.\n
  \ * fixed some problems when working in a --partial repository.\n  * lots of code
  was cleaned up.  We have enabled the -Wall compiler flag\n    and are in the process
  of eliminating all the warnings.  This should\n    make the code more friendly to
  new developers, and also helps with the\n    next bullet point:\n  * improved handling
  of errors--informative failure messages are more\n    likely than they were before.\n
  \ * by default only check changes made since last checkpoint--this greatly\n    speeds
  up check.\n  * add --quiet option.  Some commands don't yet support this.  If\n
  \   there's a command you want to quiet down, let us know.\n  * several performance
  enhancements: improved SHA1 performance, faster\n    check and get on repositories
  with a long history and improved\n    performance with very large files.\n\n --
  David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Thu,  1 Apr 2004 05:43:18 -0500\n\ndarcs
  (0.9.17)\n\n  * fixed bug in darcs apply that made the --no-test option fail.\n
  \ * fixed bug that caused darcs to set file permissions to be\n    non-world-readable.\n
  \ * darcs record and whatsnew can now accept file or directory arguments\n    and
  limit their actions to changes in those files or directories.\n  * darcs changes
  now can accept file or directory arguments and limit\n    itself to changes affecting
  those files or directories.\n\n -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Sat,
  21 Feb 2004 08:12:34 -0500\n\ndarcs (0.9.16)\n\n  * Add --sign-as=KEYID option to
  push command.\n  * make optimize split up inventory for faster pulls\n  * Allow
  use of a different make command for tests, such as gmake\n  * Can now put prefs
  that would normally go in _darcs/prefs (defaults,\n    binaries and boring) in ~/.darcs/
  to set the prefs for all your\n    repositories at once.\n  * add primitive xml
  output to annotate of directory.\n  * When pushing a patch, add the list of changes
  in the description.\n  * refuse to rollback a patch twice, since that would cause
  problems.\n  * make darcs diff accept optional arguments indicating files and\n
  \   directories to diff.\n  * preserve permissions on files in working directory.\n
  \ * put docs in ...share/doc/darcs not share/darcs/doc.\n  * add support for multiple-choice
  options.  This means that you can now\n    set your default option in _darcs/prefs/defaults,
  and then override\n    that default on the command line.\n  * shortened --use-external-merge-tool
  option to --external-merge\n  * more \"boring\" patterns.\n\n -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>
  \ Tue, 10 Feb 2004 07:08:14 -0500\n\ndarcs (0.9.15)\n\n  * next step repository
  format transition--we use the new patch filenames.\n  * fix handling of text files
  with no trailing newline--this will cause\n    some trouble.  Darcs will require
  that you convert your repository\n    using convert-repo.  This will leave you with
  a bunch of changes\n    regarding trailing newlines which you will either want to
  record or\n    revert.\n  * the windows support is somewhat improved.\n  * added
  simple \"repair\" command that can repair some kinds of\n    inconsistencies in
  the repository.\n  * added primitive \"annotate\" command to extract information
  about\n    modifications to files and directories.\n  * fixed handling of darcs
  mv to allow moving to directories in a more\n    intuitive manner.\n  * handling
  of binary files was dramatically improved in both memory and\n    cpu usage.\n  *
  added autoconf testing framework to clean up code dealing with\n    different versions
  of ghc, features that don't exist on windows, bugs\n    that only exist on windows,
  etc.\n  * don't accept invalid flags.\n  * add more patterns to boring and binary.\n
  \ * use autoconf test to handle posix signals and windows '\\\\' handling.\n  *
  switch to using new patch filenames.\n  * XML formatted output for 'changes' command\n
  \ * add support for unidiff-like whatsnew output.\n  * fix bug in RTS memory calculation
  for large RAM size\n  * add rollback command.\n  * improve checkpointing support.\n
  \ * add diff-opts option to darcs diff.\n  * add support for building docs using
  htlatex or hevea rather than\n    latex2html.\n  * use locking whereever it is needed.\n
  \ * add safe (atomic) writing of inventory files.\n\n -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>
  \ Fri, 12 Dec 2003 07:59:54 -0500\n\ndarcs (0.9.14)\n\n  * darcs changes now shows
  times formatted according to current locale.\n  * add support for automatically
  treating files containing ^Z or '\\0' as\n    binary.\n  * add experimental checkpointing,
  allowing get to only download the\n    recent change history.\n  * allow darcs to
  be called within subdirectories of a repository.\n  * make default be to compress
  patches.\n  * add --summary option to whatsnew.\n  * add trackdown command.\n  *
  fix bug in darcs dist --verbose.\n  * make darcs diff have closer behavior to cvs
  diff.  In particular, darcs\n    diff with no arguments now gives you the difference
  between the working\n    directory and the latest recorded version.\n  * support
  external graphical merge tools.\n  * fix bug where binary patch is created even
  with no change.\n  * support darcs -v for version.  Also mention the darcs version
  in the\n    usage mesage.\n  * ignore empty lines in boring file and binary file.\n
  \ * preserve pending changes (e.g. file adds or darcs replaces) across\n    revert
  and record.\n  * create repositories with new patch filename format.\n    The new
  repo format is now created alongside the old format, but the\n    old format is
  read.  There is a tool called convert-repo that will\n    convert an old format
  repo to have both formats.\n  * use iso format for dates in record.\n  * New patch-selecting
  interface.\n    This patch only uses the new routine for revert, since it's not\n
  \   particularly well tested.  The text method now allows one to go back\n    and
  edit previous patches.  The idea is that eventually all commands\n    that need
  the user to select a subset of patches will use this routine.\n  * use hash for
  cgi cache file names.\n  * add preliminary experimental GUI support using wxhaskell.\n
  \ * remember author name after first record in a repo.\n  * add unrevert command.\n
  \ * always match full pathnames when checking boringness or binaryness.\n  * rewrite
  replace tokenizer for more speed.\n  * make darcs compile with ghc 6.2 and later.\n
  \ * fix some bugs in darcs diff.\n  * make --and-apply work locally as well as via
  ssh.\n    Also added a --and-apply-as that uses sudo to run the apply command as\n
  \   a different user.\n\n -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Mon, 10 Nov
  2003 07:08:20 -0500\n\ndarcs (0.9.13)\n\n  * Various performance enhancements.\n
  \ * add --pipe option to tag and record, which causes them to prompt for\n    all
  their input, including date.  This can be useful when creating\n    repository converters.\n
  \ * remove '-t' short command line option for '--to' and the '-o' short\n    option
  for '--reponame'.\n  * remove the darcs-patcher program.\n        The functionality
  of the darcs-patcher program is taken over by\n        the darcs apply command.
  \ Several fancy features have been added,\n        as described in the Apply section
  of the manual.\n  * support spaces and (maybe) unicode in filenames.\n  * updates
  to win32 support\n  * push via ssh\n  * add --without-libcurl option to configure\n
  \ * include DarcsURL in push email.\n  * add support for reading and writing gzipped
  patch files.\n  * allow multiple --to addresses on push, and also support --cc for\n
  \   additional addresses.\n  * when pulling or pushing from lastrepo, say where
  lastrepo is.\n  * only save lastrepo in get if the source repo wasn't a relative\n
  \   directory path.\n\n -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>\n\ndarcs (0.9.12)\n\n
  \ * add manual section on building darcs.\n  * improve scaling of checking for and
  resolving conflicts, which was an\n    O(n^2) function.\n  * escape ESC char when
  printing patches.\n  * don't reorder patches unless necesary--this avoids an O(n^2)
  operation\n    which was making a darcs record very slow when a lot of files were\n
  \   added.\n  * fix default regexps for boring file (Thanks Trevor!)\n  * replace
  now ignores files that aren't in the repo.\n  * make darcs add refuse to add files
  whose subdirectories don't exist.\n  * implement support for binary files.\n  *
  added support for running external programs to fetch files.\n  * fix conflict resolution
  bug from 0.9.11.\n  * make the patcher run the test prior to applying.\n  * add
  repo locking.\n  * Fix bug when pulling from a repo containing just one patch (thanks\n
  \   Peter).\n  * install cgi script in cgi-bin directory.\n\n -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>\n\ndarcs
  (0.9.11)\n\n  * A rewrite of the configure code and makefile (thanks to Peter Simons).\n
  \ * Added several new repository configuration options including a setpref\n    command
  which allows you to set preferences options that are pulled\n    from repo to repo.\n
  \ * Yet another rewrite of the merging code.\n  * User can now revert changes on
  a change-by-change basis.\n  * Yet another major improvement in speed and memory
  consumption.\n  * Add a darcs diff command to compare two versions.\n\n -- David
  Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Mon, 30 Jun 2003 06:42:10 -0400\n\ndarcs (0.9.10)\n\n
  \ * Added a way to configure the default values for options to darcs\n    commands.
  \ See Appendix B of manual.\n  * darcs push and pull now default to pulling and
  pushing from the most\n    recently accessed repository (if you don't specify a
  repo).\n  * Numerous bugfixes.\n\n -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Wed,
  21 May 2003 07:08:40 -0400\n\ndarcs (0.9.9)\n\n  * Created a way to have a \"centralized
  server\".  (See darcs-patcher\n    chapter in manual).\n  * Added new darcs-server
  package.\n  * Switch to new repository format.  Note that your repo will only be\n
  \   converted to the new format if you use certain commands such as\n    unpull.
  \ You can recognize the new format by the presence of a\n    _darcs/inventories/
  directory.\n  * Add the ability to sign patches sent with push using gnupg and to\n
  \   verify those signatures when applying.  (This is the authentication\n    basis
  for the above-mentioned server).\n  * Fix bug in application of a file rename patch.\n\n
  -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Thu,  8 May 2003 06:58:42 -0400\n\ndarcs
  (0.9.8)\n\n  * Fix rare bug in check when files happen to be a multiple of 1024
  bytes\n    in length.\n  * Fix bug in reading patch ids with long comments from
  local files.\n  * Prepare for a change in the repository format.  The format doesn't\n
  \   change for this version, but version 0.9.8 is able to read the new\n    repository
  format.\n\n -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Wed, 30 Apr 2003 08:54:18
  -0400\n\ndarcs (0.9.7)\n\n  * Fix a couple of rename conflict bugs.\n  * Add new
  test suite framework, along with several tests.\n  * Several major optimizations
  for speed and memory.\n  * Added --ignore-times option to not assume that when a
  file\n    modification time hasn't changed the file itself hasn't changed.\n\n --
  David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Sat, 26 Apr 2003 07:57:01 -0400\n\ndarcs
  (0.9.6)\n\n  * Fixed a couple of bugs in the merging of conflicting renames.\n  *
  Added an interface to include long comments when recording.\n  * Improve the interface
  of pull, allowing for viewing the patches before\n    pulling them.\n  * Include
  zsh command completion examples with docs.\n  * Massively improved responsiveness
  in command completion.\n  * Use packed strings to save memory.\n  * Fixed a bug
  that shows up in empty repos.\n  * Fixed multiple bugs in the mv command.\n\n --
  David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Thu, 17 Apr 2003 09:34:34 -0400\n\ndarcs
  (0.9.5)\n\n  * Improve merge of creation of files and directories with the same
  name.\n  * Add darcs push and apply commands, which are the beginning of work\n
  \   towards supporting a \"centralized server\" concept a la CVS.  However,\n    they
  are also useful for a \"Linus\" style workflow, based on emailing\n    patches.
  \ In theory they could also be used to provide a smart server\n    that could server
  pulls using less bandwidth.\n  * Add an unpull command analagous to unrecord, but
  which removes the\n    patches from the working directory also.\n  * Enable the
  mv command, since the mv patches have now been supported by\n    a couple of versions.\n
  \ * Include zsh_completion code, thanks to Aaron Denney <wnoise@ofb.net>.\n\n --
  David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Wed,  9 Apr 2003 07:52:01 -0400\n\ndarcs
  (0.9.4)\n\n  * Speed up whatsnew and record in the case where there are huge numbers\n
  \   of extra files in the working directory.\n  * Small (~10%) speedup in get.\n\n
  -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Fri,  4 Apr 2003 09:08:38 -0500\n\ndarcs
  (0.9.3)\n\n  * Optimized whatsnew and record by seting modification time of \"current\"\n
  \   files equal to that of working files if they are identical, so I won't\n    have
  to check again if the working one hasn't been changed.\n  * Rewrite file renaming
  code (no creation).\n  * Add support for replacing tokens in files.\n  * Make cgi
  output work more accurately, and point out which files were\n    modified by each
  patch.\n  * Add a caching feature to the cgi script to speed things up a bit.\n
  \ * Turn on creation of dependencies when recording.\n  * Add a 'tag' command.\n
  \ * Rewrote the 'pull' code to hopefully speed it up (and in any case to\n    greatly
  simplify it).\n\n -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Thu,  3 Apr 2003 07:08:05
  -0500\n\ndarcs (0.9.2)\n\n  * Add build dependency on tetex and latex2html\n  *
  Have internal diff code properly respond to deleted files and\n    directories.\n
  \ * Create file and directory rename patch types. (no creation--which\n    means
  that I am waiting to create commands to create such patches\n    until later, to
  avoid backward compatibility issues of repos.)\n  * Add support for patch dependencies.
  (no creation)\n  * Add support for token replacement patches. (no creation)\n\n
  -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Thu, 27 Mar 2003 07:59:09 -0500\n\ndarcs
  (0.9.1)\n\n  * Make darcs get --verbose actually be verbose (which is important\n
  \   because it takes so long that the user might be afraid it's hanging.\n  * Speed
  up the merge in complicated cases, possibly dramatically.\n  * Add a darcs remove
  command.\n\n -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Mon, 10 Mar 2003 09:48:55

  About
  -----

  [Darcs](http://darcs.net) is a distributed version control system
  written in Haskell.

  Building
  --------

  To build and install the latest release, use

  ```
  cabal update && cabal install darcs
  ```

  with a recent cabal (version 3.2 or later is recommended). Any version of
  ghc from 8.2 up to 9.4 should work.

  From inside a clone or a source dist, use

  ```
  > cabal build
  ```

  Cabal will tell you where the resulting darcs binary is. If you'd rather
  use `cabal install` and you are in a clone (not a source dist), you first have
  to generate the version info, like this:

  ```
  > runghc release/gen-version-info.hs
  > cabal install
  ```

  Building/installing with stack used to work with a few tweaks, but is no
  longer officially supported due to lack of manpower. If this inconveniences
  you, consider contributing patches to maintain our stack.yaml.

  Testing
  -------

  Running the test-suite is optional, of course, but useful if you want to
  help find bugs or before you contribute patches. The easiest and most
  flexible way to do this is

  ```
  > cabal configure --enable-tests
  > cabal run darcs-test -- [options for darcs-test, try --help]
  ```

  Using
  -----

  To clone a repository via HTTP and send patches by mail:

  ```
  > darcs clone --lazy http://darcs.net
  > # edit files...
  > darcs add my_new_file
  > darcs record -m "my changes"
  > darcs send
  ```

  To clone via SSH and push patches:

  ```
  > darcs clone user@hub.darcs.net:user/repo
  > # edit files...
  > darcs add my_new_file
  > darcs record -m "my changes"
  > darcs push
  ```

  To create a project and start working:

  ```
  > darcs init my_project
  > cd my_project
  > # create and edit files...
  > darcs add my_new_file
  > darcs record -m "initial version"
  ```

  Pull new patches from upstream:

  ```
  > darcs pull
  ```

  Documentation
  -------------

  Concise and up-to-date documentation is available from darcs itself:

  ```
  > darcs help # list all commands
  > darcs help command # help for specific command
  > darcs command --help # dito
  ```

  The complete documentation is available as a man page which can be generated
  using

  ```
  darcs help manpage > darcs.1
  ```

  Reporting bugs
  --------------

  Please send bug reports to <bugs@darcs.net>. This will automatically add
  your report to the bug tracker. If you are unsure or just have a question or
  a comment, you can subscribe to darcs-users@darcs.net and post your question
  or comments there. See http://darcs.net/MailingLists for details.

  There is also an IRC channel named `#darcs` on freenode.net, where you can
  report problems or ask questions.


  Hacking
  -------

  We are happy to receive patches and will try our best to review them in a
  timely fashion. Just record your patches in a clone of
  <http://darcs.net/screened> and `darcs send` them. You are encouraged, but not
  required, to look at <http://darcs.net/Development/GettingStarted> for
  additional information.

  BTW, the wiki is a darcs repo, you can clone it with:

  ```
  > darcs clone --lazy http://darcs.net/darcs-wiki
  ```

  to edit the contents and send us patches.
