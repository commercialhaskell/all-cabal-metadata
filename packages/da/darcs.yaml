changelog: "Darcs 2.16.4, 20 May 2021\n\n  This release is mostly to fix http://bugs.darcs.net/issue2674
  which can\n  lead to repository corruption. This is not quite as bad as it sounds,\n
  \ since the broken changes that you could have recorded were consistently\n  ignored
  when applying the patch. This bug has been in darcs for a very\n  long time and
  even our own repos contain (ancient) patches with broken\n  move changes, and so
  far it hasn't caused us any trouble.\n\n  That said, there are certain patch commutations
  that will erroneously (and\n  unexpectedly) fail when such a patch is involved.
  We therefore recommend\n  to upgrade. You may also (after upgrading) run 'darcs
  check' on your\n  repositories to see if you are affected, and 'darcs repair' them
  if that\n  is the case. Fortunately, the broken move changes can be safely eliminated\n
  \ from existing patches, and the improved repair command now does exactly\n  that.\n\n
  \ Thanks to lemming@henning-thielemann.de for bringing this bug to our\n  attention.\n\n
  \ * resolve issue2674: moving unadded files\n  * add a check/repair rule for bad
  move patches\n    This drops a move patch with either non-existing source or existing
  target.\n\n  Also related to issue2674:\n\n  * improve error message when runDefault
  fails due to an IO error\n  * remove catching of exceptions for bad moves in DefaultIO\n
  \ * fail in Darcs.Util.Tree.Monad.rename if source does not exist\n  * test that
  we cannot record patches that depend on broken moves\n\n  The rest of the changes
  are minor bug fixes plus a few dependencies.\n\n  * resolve issue2670: convert \".\"
  to absolute path when creating a repo\n    This bug was introduced by fix for issue2668.\n
  \ * resolve issue2668: createDirectory: permission denied\n  * resolve issue2667:
  darcs init failed with permission denied\n  * bugfix: --leave-test-dir should be
  off by default\n  * bash_completion: use '--list-options' before any other option\n
  \   This is so to avoid that, e.g.:\n    $ darcs record -m <Tab><Tab>\n    results
  in a patch named '--list-options' being recorded.\n  * zsh completion: use '--list-options'
  before any other option\n    See the corresponding change in the bash completion
  for details.\n  * zsh completion: improve the get/clone case\n    Moving the special
  case for get/clone down into the catch-all case for the\n    current word allows
  it to complete options and local paths.\n  * bugfix: --leave-test-dir should be
  off by default\n  * bugfix in readPendingAndMovesAndUnrecorded\n  * print patch
  application warnings to stderr, not stdout\n\nDarcs 2.16.3, 22 October 2020\n\n
  \ * Fix building with `-f curl` (issue2655)\n  * Fix building with stack\n  * Various
  fixes in our custom Setup.hs, mostly to do with cabal commands\n    exectuted inside
  the unpacked source dist tar ball\n  * Remove obsolete dependency on split package\n
  \ * Remove dependency on sandi and use base16-bytestring >= 1.0, improving\n    performance
  when darcs handles binary files and patches, and more\n    generally whenever we
  convert hashes from/to text.\n  * Various minor fixes and additions to tests scripts\n
  \ * Issues fixed:\n    * 2654: amend --prompt-long-comment removes the long comment\n
  \   * 2658: show dependencies should only show direct dependencies\n    * 2659:
  check for bad patch name after invoking editor, too\n\nDarcs 2.16.2, 19 August 2020\n\n
  \ * Fix build problem when using 'cabal install' from inside the sdist.\n\n    This
  fails because in this case cabal will try to 'cabal sdist' the\n    bundled shelly
  dependency, and we do not (nor want to) list all shelly\n    files in our own cabal
  file. To avoid problems like this, we no longer\n    use the bundled shelly as a
  dependency, but rather as part of our\n    sources for the test suite.\n\nDarcs
  2.16.1, 14 August 2020\n\n  * Building:\n    * Drop support for building with ghc-8.0\n
  \   * Allow clean (warning-free) builds with all ghc versions from 8.2.2 up\n      to
  ghc-8.10.1\n    * Various dependency updates\n    * Remove sdist and postConf hooks
  from Setup.hs\n    * move -DHAVE_MAPI from Setup.hs to darcs.cabal\n    * Recommended
  way to build is using cabal-install >= 3.0\n    * The source tree now contains a
  cleaned-up version of shelly-1.7.1\n      (locally named shelly-1.7.1.1) which we
  need to run our test suite.\n      Unfortunately, later versions break compatibility
  on Windows and\n      keeping the dependency fixed to 1.7.1 would mean we cannot
  support\n      newer ghc versions.\n\n  * Preliminary UNSTABLE support for a new
  patch theory named \"darcs-3\",\n    largely based on the pioneering work of Ian
  Lynagh for 'camp'.\n\n    Please note that this format is not yet officially supported:
  some\n    features (like conversion from older formats) are still missing, and we\n
  \   have not yet finalized the on-disk format. You should NOT use it for any\n    serious
  work yet.\n\n    The new theory finally solves all the well-known consistency problems\n
  \   that plagued the earlier ones, and thus fixes a number of issues\n    (including
  issue1401 and issue2605) that have been outstanding for many\n    years. It also
  reduces the worst case asymptotic runtime for commutation\n    and merging from
  exponential to merely quadratic in the number of\n    patches involved.\n\n    One
  of the reasons we are confident this new theory and its\n    implementation is sound,
  i.e. respect all required properties, is that\n    we have improved our test case
  generator for sequences of patches. It\n    now generates all possible conflict
  scenarios. Since the new theory no\n    longer has worst case exponential runtime,
  we can and did test all\n    required properties and invariants with a large number
  of generated test\n    cases (up to 100000).\n\n  * The internals of how 'darcs
  rebase' stores and handles suspended patches\n    and their \"fixups\" has been
  changed in incompatible ways. This means\n    that if you have a rebase in progress
  started with darcs < 2.16, you\n    will first need to use the new 'darcs rebase
  upgrade' command to upgrade\n    the suspended patches to the new format. If you
  start a rebase with\n    darcs-2.16, then earlier darcs versions will not work with
  that repo,\n    until you have finished the rebase.\n\n    The new implementation
  fixes a lot of bugs (including outright crashes\n    in some situations). The behavior
  when conflicted patches are suspended\n    is much better now, though there are
  still a few corner cases where the\n    behavior can be quite unintuitive, especially
  when complicated conflicts\n    are suspended.\n\n    A number of limitations regarding
  repositories with a rebase in progress\n    have been lifted; in particular, push,
  pull, and clone between repos can\n    now be done regardless of whether any of
  the repos have a rebase in\n    progress or not.\n\n  * The way conflict markup
  is generated has been cleaned up and refactored.\n    The main user-visible improvement
  is that darcs now reliably /either/\n    marks a conflict /or/ keeps the default
  resolution (i.e. remove both\n    changes) and reports the conflicts that it cannot
  mark. Previously,\n    conflicts that could not be properly marked (roughly all
  conflicts\n    involving changes other than hunks, e.g. replaces and file or dir
  adds,\n    removes, and renames) would be silently \"half-resolved\" in favour of
  one\n    of the alternatives. This could be pretty confusing, the more so since\n
  \   it was hard to predict which of the conflicting alternatives was chosen.\n\n
  \ * Complete re-implementation of the way in which the pending patch is\n    updated
  after record and amend. This fixes a number of problems with\n    pending becoming
  corrupt. The new code also works in cases where hunks\n    are edited interactively.
  The algorithm is documented in detail.\n\n  * Downloading files via http now uses
  the http-conduit package. This is\n    now the default method when building darcs.
  Building against the curl\n    library is still supported but you have to explicitly
  request it by\n    passing -fcurl to cabal.\n\n  * Reworked internal failure handling
  so we can clearly distinguish between\n    normal command failures and internal
  errors, i.e bugs, in darcs. In case\n    of a bug, darcs exits with status 4 and
  prints a message that asks the\n    user to report it and how to do that.\n\n  *
  During interactive patch selection, the 'x', 'v', and 'p' keys no longer\n    print
  the patch description (if any), only the summary or the patch\n    content. A new
  key 'r' was added to re-display the currently selected\n    patch in default mode
  (normally this is just the description). See\n    issue2649 for details.\n\n  *
  A large number of other internal refactors and code cleanups.\n\n  * A forward compatibility
  bug (issue2650), roughly fixed in Darcs 2.14.5,\n    is now resolved in full. In
  particular, we modify the format file only\n    if we have taken the repo lock,
  silently fix possibly corrupted entries\n    when reading the format file, internally
  document the forward\n    compatibility rules, and finally test them more thoroughly.\n\n
  \ * Issues fixed:\n    * 1316: amend-record: files/dirs still in pending even if
  they are removed\n    * 1609: darcs conflict marking gives different results in
  different orders\n    * 2001: repair fails to detect missing pristine files\n    *
  2275: ignore symlinks as repo paths even when the index is used\n    * 2404: darcs
  convert export ignores --repodir\n    * 2441: Use pager for darcs annotate\n    *
  2445: internal error if suspended patch is pulled into repository again\n    * 2454:
  help markdown/manpage should use a pager\n    * 2533: add umask option to all commands
  that modify the repo\n    * 2536: show files --no-files: can't mix match and pending
  flags\n    * 2548: inconsistent pending after addfile f; rm f; mkdir f\n    * 2550:
  apply only properly mangled resolutions, warn about any others\n    * 2592: update
  pending with coalesced look-for changes\n    * 2593: network test can collide with
  shell tests\n    * 2594: darcs show index crashes replace with unrecorded force
  hunk\n    * 2599: don't bother to update pending when cloning a repo\n    * 2603:
  warn and mark conflicts when cloning\n    * 2604: remove --reply and related options\n
  \   * 2608: download _darcs/hashed_inventory separately\n    * 2610: add --inherit-default
  option\n    * 2614: (an intermediate regression)\n    * 2618: option --ask-deps
  adds too many dependencies\n    * 2625: catch only IO exceptions from applyToWorking\n
  \   * 2626: treat applyToWorking more uniformly\n    * 2634: use unwind to suspend
  patches\n    * 2635: build/install man page only if we build darcs executable\n
  \   * 2639: darcs diff crashes with --last=1 and file name\n    * 2645: search for
  \":\" to detect ssh URLs only up to the first \"/\"\n    * 2648: convert import
  with non-ASCII meta data and filepaths\n    * 2649: cleanup display of patches\n\n
  \ * Partial fixes:\n    * 1959: read-only commands should not need write access
  to the index\n      This is mostly fixed, see tests/issue1959-unwritable-darcsdir.sh\n
  \     for the few remaining problematic cases. We also now check\n      writability
  of the index when we start a transaction.\n\n  * Miscellaneous user-visible changes
  and bugfixes:\n    * always prompt for confirmation when there are conflicts with
  unrecorded\n      changes\n    * darcs optimize upgrade: don't throw away pending\n
  \   * use cryptonite instead of cryptohash and random; the random junk added\n      to
  patch meta data now uses a cryptographically secure random number\n      generator;
  also replaces our own implementation of SHA1\n    * darcs repair: handle broken
  binary patches\n    * fail if pending patch cannot be parsed instead of silently
  ignoring it\n    * darcs remove: don't allow removal of root\n    * darcs suspend

  when no files were added\n    * darcs optimize compress: don't compress special
  patches such as\n      pending or unrevert\n    * darcs send: bugfix on Windows

  tag is not in our repo\n    * darcs apply: fix lazy reading of inventories\n    *
  darcs amend: fix editing of tag names\n    * clone to ssh: don't overwrite existing
  remote target directories\n    * darcs rebase: remove error if no suspended patches
  found\n    * fully respect the (badly named) --no-ignore-times option (which\n      actually
  means to ignore the index)\n    * replace the code for creating unique temporary
  directory names\n      (that was prone to race conditions); instead we now use the
  temporary\n      package\n    * darcs check/repair: detect and repair missing (hashed)
  pristine files\n    * remove option --restrict-paths (is always active now)\n    *
  remove defunct --set-default option for rebase pull\n    * remove env var DARCS_DO_COLOR_LINES\n
  \   * demote errors in defaults file and commandline to warnings\n    * add --not-in-remote
  option to amend and rebase suspend; the option\n      is now supported by all history
  editing commands.\n    * remove our own optimisation settings in darcs.cabal\n    *
  regard explicit dependencies as resolving conflicts\n    * suspend reify: give reified

  than one file argument is now an error\n\n  * Changes in the output of commands:\n
  \   * add a warning when the index code ignores a symlink\n    * print remote execution
  failure message to stderr\n    * darcs amend: respect verbosity options\n    * commands
  that can produce large amounts of output now display it using\n      a pager, similar
  to 'darcs log'\n    * remove \"withSignalsHandled:\" from message when we are interrupted
  (Ctrl-C)\n    * add progress reporting to patch index\n    * print remote execution
  failure message to stderr\n    * re-formulate the bad sources hint\n    * remove
  hint \"Do you have the right URI for the repository?\"\n    * remove the \"darcs

  description\n\nDarcs 2.14.5, 6 August 2020\n\n  * Resolve issue2650\n\n    This
  is a stupid and rather unfortunate bug that affects all previous\n    versions of
  the 2.12 and 2.14 branch. It can lead to corruption of the\n    _darcs/format file
  in repos where *future* darcs versions add an\n    alternative format property.
  The bug affects commands rebase suspend,\n    rebase pull, and rebase apply.\n\n
  \   It is possible to manually fix the corruption by deleting from\n    _darcs/format
  strings of the form \"Unknown property: \". Future releases\n    will contain a
  work-around that automatically fixes this particular kind\n    of corruption when
  reading the format file, in case it should ever\n    happen in practice. Nevertheless
  we strongly recommend to upgrade and\n    avoid using the darcs versions affected
  by this bug.\n\nDarcs 2.14.4, 28 April 2020\n\n  * Restored the ability to run our
  shell tests, at least when building\n    directly from a clone of our darcs repo.
  This was done by importing an\n    old version of shelly (1.7.1, the last that worked
  for us on Windows),\n    so that (modern) cabal picks that version instead of the
  newest one from\n    hackage. Then made it build with all supported ghc versions
  and fixed\n    all warnings.\n  * Fix the quick-and-dirty \"solutions\" to the MonadFail
  incompatibility\n    that replaced fail with error to avoid cascading MonadFail
  requirements\n    all over the place. This broke a number of our tests, proving
  it to be\n    semantically unsound, as I had expected. In most cases the correct\n
  \   solution was to replace it with (throw . userError), or if possible with\n    (liftIO
  . fail).\n\nDarcs 2.14.3, 24 April 2020\n\n  * Support for GHC 8.8 and GHC 8.10\n
  \ * Loosen upper bounds for a few dependencies\n  * mitigate issue 2643 (corrupt
  patch index) with a better error message\n  * remove our own optimisation settings
  in darcs.cabal\n  * Setup.hs: allow use of darcs as a cabal subproject\n\nDarcs

  in Darcs 2.8\n\n   * Local support for the legacy \"old-fashioned\" repository format\n
  \       has been removed.\n      * You can still work with remote repositories in
  this format\n      * Local repositories can still be upgraded via \"darcs optimize
  --upgrade\".\n   * \"darcs annotate\" is now significantly faster and uses less
  memory, although it still slows down linearly with repository size.\n   * An experimental
  option is available to speed up HTTP downloads.\n      * You can now use \"darcs
  optimize --http\" to create a repo optimized for HTTP downloads, and use \"darcs
  get --packs\" to download such a repo.\n      * There are still some known issues
  with it, so the feature is not enabled by default.\n   * Darcs now supports multiple
  email addresses for the author in the global prefs file. So, if you use different
  identities for home and work, you can now easily select between them. (issue1530)\n
  \  * The -o/-O options for obliterate which were removed in 2.5 are back.\n   *
  \"darcs status\" has been added as a hidden alias for \"darcs whatnew -ls\" to ease
  the transition from some other source control systems. (issue182)\n   * \"darcs
  amend-record\" now has the option --unrecord to allow individual changes to be unrecorded.
  (issue1470). This can also be used as \"darcs amend-unrecord\".\n   * \"darcs amend-record\"'s
  interactive selection now supports 'k' for going back to a previous patch.\n   *
  \"darcs dist\" now has the option --set-scripts-executable. (issue734)\n   * pushing
  to ssh:// URLS is now supported. eg: darcs push ssh://code.haskell.org/foo\n   *
  If a test fails during darcs record, you now have the option to record it anyway.
  (issue332)\n   * Hunk-splitting now works in \"darcs revert\" (issue114)\n   * Sending
  patches by email is now more robust and human friendly. We display a cleaner version
  in plain text for humans, and have added a complete version of the patch for \"darcs
  apply\". (issue1350)\n   * \"darcs send\" now tries to report the right character
  set in the email headers, and has the option --charset to override this.\n   * A
  new environment variable has been added to help control network connections: DARCS\\_CONNECTION\\_TIMEOUT.
  See the manual for details.\n   * The --ephemeral and --partials options to \"darcs
  get\" has been removed. \"darcs check --partial\" has also been removed.\n   * \"darcs
  rollback\" now has a --no-record option, to be used when you only want to update
  the working directory.\n   * The --nolinks option for \"darcs get\" was removed.\n
  \  * The \"--old\" flag has been removed for \"darcs init\", \"darcs get\" and \"darcs
  put\".\n   * \"darcs resolve\" has been removed an alias for \"darcs mark-conflicts\".\n
  \  * \"darcs init\" and \"darcs get\" now have a --no-working-dir option.\n   *
  Conflicts are now marked with red in the terminal. (issue1681)\n   * ssh ControlMaster
  support has been removed.\n   * ssh stderr output is now passed through, making
  it easier to diagnose problems. (issue845)\n   * Interactive selection now has a
  'g' command to go to the first patch.\n   * The --unified flag is now available
  for record, end-record, revert and unrevert (issue1166)\n   * darcs now has a \"darcs
  test\" command for running whatever test-suite is associated with the repository.\n\n
  * Other issues resolved in Darcs 2.8\n\n   * 1266: \"darcs init\" now warns when
  run inside another darcs repo.\n   * 1344: When using darcs send, let users know
  sooner if they won't eventually be able to send\n   * 1397: darcs changes /bad /paths

  diagnostic message is provided when the user tries to move the root of the repository\n
  \  * 1740: \"darcs mv\" now gracefully the handles the case where the user first
  does an \"mv\" on a directory and then follows up with a \"darcs mv\"\n   * 1804:
  The diagnostic message \"getSymbolicLinkStatus: does not exist\" has been improved\n
  \  * 1883: rename --patch-name option to --name. This is usually used in darcs record
  in shorthand (-m) form. This rename is aimed at eliminating the confusion with the
  patch matcher, which bites amend-record and rollback users.\n   * 1884: darcs get
  was wrongly reporting \"getting lazy repository\" when you hit C-c\n   * 1908: try
  to create a global cache before checking its availability\n   * 1922: Fixed bug

  and added files passed on the command line\n   * 2067: darcs diff no longer outputs
  blank lines when non-existent files are given\n   * 2076: \"darcs move myfile\"
  into directory confuses darcs\n   * 2077: \"darcs mv myfile\" into directory no
  longer confuses darcs\n   * 2079: \"darcs put\" now does --set-default by default\n\n\n\n\f\nDarcs

  when using darcs send,\n     to generate correct references in the mail header.\n\n
  \  * Repositories can no longer be created with --no-pristine-tree.\n     This only
  affects the legacy darcs-1 repository format.\n\n   * Experimental Darcs library,
  providing increase flexibility and\n     efficiency to third-party utilities (compared
  to the command-line\n     interface).  Only built via Cabal.  NOT a stable API yet.\n\n

  to prevent patch-id collisions. (issue1102, Eric Kow,\n    David Roundy)\n\n  *
  Bug Fix: Support darcs repositories which have symbolic links in their\n    paths

  \ * IMPORTANT: Create darcs-2 repositories by default in darcs init (issue806,\n
  \   David Roundy)\n\n  * User Experience: Do not allow users to add files to a darcs
  repository if\n    their filenames would be considered invalid under Windows. This
  can be\n    overridden with the --reserved-ok flag (issue53, Eric Kow)\n\n  * Bug
  Fix: Do not leave behind a half-gotten directory if darcs get fails\n    (issue1041,
  Vlad Dogaru, David Roundy)\n\n  * User Experience: notice when you are trying to
  pull from a seemingly\n    unrelated repository, that is one with a sufficiently
  different history.\n    This can be overridden with the --allow-unrelated-repos

  \ Sun, 25 Sep 2008 08:10:49 GMT\n\ndarcs (2.0.3pre1)\n\n  * New Feature: Optional
  readline-like functionality when compiled with the\n    haskeline package (Judah
  Jacobson, Gaëtan Lehmann)\n\n  * Bug Fix: No more spurious pending patches (issue709,
  issue1012, David\n    Roundy)\n\n  * Bug Fix: darcs get --to-match now works with
  hashed repositories\n    (issue885, David Roundy)\n\n  * User Experience: Catch
  mistakes in _darcs/prefs/defaults (issue691, Dmitry\n    Kurochkin)\n\n  * User
  Experience: Improved support for darcs send over http (see also\n    tools/upload.cgi)
  (Dmitry Kurochkin, David Roundy)\n\n  * Bug Fix: Recognize user@example.com: as
  an ssh path, that is, not\n    requiring a path after the server component. (David
  Roundy)\n\n  * New Feature: Accept an optional directory argument in darcs send\n
  \   --output-auto-name (Dmitry Kurochkin)\n\n  * User Experience: New --no-cache
  option to help debug network issues\n    (issue1054, Dmitry Kurochkin)\n\n  * Performance:
  New --http-pipelining and --no-http-pipelining flags. Passing\n    --http-pipelining
  to darcs can make darcs get and pull faster over HTTP.\n    Due to a libcurl bug,
  this is not the default option unless darcs is\n    compiled with libcurl 7.19.1,
  due 2008-11. (Dmitry Kurochkin)\n\n  * Bug Fix: Eliminate hanging and crashes while
  fetching files over HTTP\n    (issue920, issue977, issue996, issue1037, Dmitry Kurochkin)\n\n
  \ * Security: Fix some insecure uses of printfs in darcs.cgi (Steve Cotton)\n\n
  \ * Bug Fix: Handle filepaths in a simpler and more robust fashion. This fixes\n
  \   relative filepaths and recognition of symbolic links and avoids possible\n    future
  bugs (issue950, issue1057, David Roundy, Dmitry Kurochkin)\n\n  * Bug Fix: Make
  darcs diff --patch work even if the patch is within a tag\n    (issue966, darcs
  2 regression, Dmitry Kurochkin)\n\n  * Quality Assurance: Extend use of Haskell's
  GADTs to most of the darcs\n    code, fixing many potential bugs along the way (Jason
  Dagit, David Roundy)\n\n  * Quality Assurance: Several improvements to darcs code
  quality (Petr\n    Ročkai)\n\n  * Bug Fix: Correct assumptions made by darcs about
  Windows file size types\n    (issue1015, Simon Marlow, Ganesh Sittampalam)\n\n  *
  Bug Fix: Support case insensitive file systems using hashed repositories\n    in
  darcs repair (partial issue971, Petr Ročkai). IMPORTANT: This\n    introduces a
  memory use regression, which affects large repositories. We\n    found that doing
  a darcs repair on the GHC repository requires a machine\n    with 2 GB of RAM. The
  regression is well-understood and should be solved\n    in the next darcs release.
  In the meantime we felt that the improved\n    robustness was worth the performance
  trade-off.\n\n  * Quality Assurance: Simplify building darcs on Windows by optionally
  using\n    the zlib and terminfo Haskell packages (Ganesh Sittampalam, Petr Ročkai)\n\n
  \ * User Experience: Better error reporting when patches that should commute\n    fail
  to do so. (Jason Dagit)\n\n  * New Feature: --match \"touch filenames\", for example
  --match 'touch\n    foo|bar|splotz.*(c|h)' (issue115, Dmitry Kurochkin)\n\n  * User
  Experience: Improve debugging and error messages in HTTP code (Dmitry\n    Kurochkin,
  David Roundy)\n\n  * Bug Fix: Ensure that darcs responds to Ctrl-C on Window, even
  if compiled\n    with GHC < 6.10 (issue1016, Simon Marlow)\n\n  * New Feature: darcs
  changes --context now also works with --human-readable\n    and --xml-output (issue995,
  Dmitry Kurochkin)\n\n  * Bug Fix: Always darcs send with context, as if --unified
  flag were used\n    (was implemented in 2.0.2, but not consistently) (David Roundy)\n\n
  \ * Bug Fix: Make sure that darcs get --tag works even when the user hits\n    Ctrl-C
  to get a lazy repository (Dmitry Kurochkin)\n\n  * Quality Assurance: Improvements
  to documentation and online help, most\n    crucially, user-focused help on upgrading
  to darcs 2. (Trent Buck, Lele\n    Gaifax, Simon Michael, Max Battcher)\n\n  * New
  Feature: darcs changes --number associates each patch with number,\n    counting
  backwards (see the --index feature) (David Roundy)\n\n  * New Feature: ability to
  match patches on index, for example, darcs changes\n    --index=3-6 shows the last
  three to six patches (David Roundy)\n\n  * User Experience: slightly reduce the
  verbosity of darcs pull --verbose\n    (David Roundy)\n\n -- Eric Kow <E.Y.Kow@brighton.ac.uk>

  \ * Fix issue 600, bug in darcs optimize --relink. (David Roundy, Trent Buck,\n

  messages. If darcs takes more\n    than about one second to run a command, some
  sort of feedback should now\n    be provided. (David Roundy)\n\n  * Rewrite rollback,
  changing its behavior to be more useful. Rollback now\n    prompts for a name for
  the new \"rollback\" patches. It also allows you to\n    roll back multiple patches
  simultaneously, and to roll back only portions\n    of the patches selected. Altogether,
  rollback is now more interactive, and\n    should also be more useful. (David Roundy)\n\n

  \"auto-optimize\" support for hashed inventories, in that darcs\n    automatically
  optimizes inventories when it seems wise (which is currently\n    defined as \"every

  in conflict handling. Thanks to\n    Peter for pointing these out!.\n\n  * Fix reading
  of hashed repositories to avoid reading patches that we don't\n    actually need
  (i.e. foolish inefficiency bug). Thanks to Simon for\n    reporting these performance
  bugs.\n\n  * Added a new --debug flag for debug output.\n\n  * Added compatibility

  \ * Fix bug where parsing of setpref patch called tailPS unnecessarily. (David\n
  \   Roundy)\n\n  * Refactor parsing of commands and command line arguments. Implement
  hidden\n    commands. (Eric Kow)\n\n  * Use a single command to initialize a remote
  repository. This replaces the\n    method of stringing together multiple commands
  with the shell-dependent &&\n    operator. (Tristan Seligmann)\n\n  * Allow for
  files in _darcs/inventories to be gzipped. This is not\n    specifically related
  to issue553, but it fixes a regression introduced by\n    the issue553 fix. (Issue553,
  Eric Kow)\n\n  * Check for potential hash collision in writeHashFile. (Eric Kow)\n\n
  \ * Don't try to write hash file if it already exists, as you can not\n    overwrite
  an open file on Windows. (Issue553, Eric Kow)\n\n  * Close file handles when done
  reading it lazily. (Eric Kow)\n\n  * Modernize and enhance buggy renameFile workaround
  by using the\n    hierarchical library structure and only catching 'does not exist'
  errors.\n    (Eric Kow)\n\n  * Add \"hidden\" printer for decorating patches with
  color for easier reading\n    when printed to screen during verbose or debug output,
  but hides (removes)\n    the decoration when printing to the repository files. This
  is the\n    counterpart of the invisible printer, which makes non-human-friendly

  \ * Move conditional #include from Darcs.External to makefile. The GHC manual\n
  \   says that this is *not* the preferred option, but for some reason, the\n    include

  \ * Use prettyException in clarify_errors so we don't blame user for darcs'\n    own
  errors. (Issue73, Eric Kow)\n\n  * Rename command 'resolve' to 'mark-conflicts'.
  'Resolve' remains as a\n    hidden alias. (issue113, Eric Kow)\n\n  * Make 'query

  in autoconf.mk.in. (Issue493, Eric Kow)\n\n  * Fix a bug where Get --partial would
  use a checkpoint without detecting it\n    was invalid. Checkpoints can for example
  become invalid after an Optimize\n    --reorder. (issue490, David Roundy)\n\n  *
  User Agent size limit for curl gets is removed. (Issue420, Kevin Quick)\n\n  * Don't
  garb string parameters passed to libcurl, as required by the api\n    specification.
  (Daniel Gorin)\n\n  * Fix handling of --repo with relative paths. (Eric Kow)\n\n
  \ * Check for gzopen in zlib. curl depends on zlib and is detected prior to\n    zlib
  by the configure file, but without the -lz flag on some versions.\n    (Andres Loeh)\n\n
  \ * Switch to haskell's System.Process under Unix for execution of external\n    commands;

  they run before the\n    command is executed. This can for example be used to convert
  line endings\n    or check character encodings before every Record. The darcs command
  aborts\n    if the prehook exits with an error status. (Jason Dagit)\n\n  * Use
  system instead of rawSystem for calling interactive cmds in Windows,\n    which
  lets us support switches, for example, in DARCS_EDITOR. (Eric Kow)\n\n  * add support
  for partial and lazy downloading of hashed repositories.\n    (David Roundy)\n\n
  \ * Fix refactoring bug in Checkpoints where we sometimes looked for things in\n
  \   the wrong place. (David Roundy)\n\n  * Fail on error in get_patches_beyond_tag.
  This will expose any bugs where\n    we use this function wrongly. (As was the case
  in darcs check --partial\n    with hashed inventories.) (David Roundy)\n\n  * Restructure
  the source tree hierarchy from a mostly flat layout to one\n    with directories
  and subdirectories that reflects the modularity of the\n    source. (Eric Kow)\n\n
  \ * In tests, don't assume grep has -q and -x flags. (Dave Love)\n\n  * Add --output-auto-name

  --complement\" operation. Updated\n    documentation to explain why \"darcs pull
  --complement R1 R1\" is the same\n    as \"darcs pull R1\" instead of the empty
  set. (Kevin Quick)\n\n  * Change all \"current\" to \"pristine\" in manual and help
  texts. (Tommy\n    Pettersson)\n\n  * Added the ability to specify the --complement
  argument on the pull command\n    as an alternative to --intersect and --union.
  When --complement is\n    specified, candidate patches for a pull are all of the
  pullable patches\n    that exist in the first repository specified but which don't
  exist in any\n    of the remaining repositories (the set-theory complement of the
  first\n    repository to the union of the remaining repositories). (Kevin Quick)\n\n
  \ * Fix bug where darcs would try to write temporary files in the root\n    directory
  (/) if it couldn't find a repository root to write them in. Now\n    it uses the
  current directory in that case. (issue385, Zachary P. Landau)\n\n  * Make write_repo_format
  use the same syntax as read_repo_format when\n    dealing with different repository
  formats. (Benedikt Schmidt)\n\n  * Remove some unused functions from Population.
  (Eric Kow)\n\n  * Use IO.bracket instead of Control.Exception.bracket in Exec, to
  restore\n    the old way darcs works on *nix. (Eric Kow)\n\n  * Import bracketOnError
  from Workaround instead of Control.Exception to\n    support GHC 6.4. (Eric Kow)\n\n

  \   commands; requires GHC 6.4. (Simon Marlow)\n\n  * Fix bug where darcs ignored

  Prettify exceptions in identifyRepository. (Juliusz Chroboczek)\n\n  * QP-encode
  patch bundles transfered with the Put command. (Juliusz\n    Chroboczek)\n\n  *

  comment from OPTIONS pragma for GHC 6.4 compatibility. (Eric Kow)\n\n  * Make hashed
  inventories support optimize and reordering. (David Roundy)\n\n  * Change all Maybe
  Patch to the new type Hopefully Patch, which is similar\n    to Either String, for

  (David Roundy)\n\n  * Fix hashed inventory bug in Add. (David Roundy)\n\n  * Make
  Get and Put reuse code for Initialize. This makes Put accept any\n    flags that
  Init accepts. (David Roundy)\n\n  * Fix new get to not mess up pending. (David Roundy)\n\n
  \ * External resolution can resolve conflicting adds. (Edwin Thomson)\n\n  * Only
  copy the files that are needed for the resolution, when invoking an\n    external
  resolution tool. This saves much time and resources on\n    repositories with many
  files in them. (Edwin Thomson)\n\n  * Change message in 'darcs check' from \"applying\"
  to \"checking\". (issue147,\n    Tommy Pettersson)\n\n  * Add code fore hashed inventories.
  (David Roundy)\n\n  * New option for Diff: --store-in-memory. darcs diff usually
  builds the\n    version to diff in a temporary file tree, but with --store-in-memory
  it\n    will represent the files in memory, which is much faster (unless the tmp\n
  \   directory already is a ram disk). (Edwin Thomson)\n\n  * Fix bug where duplicated
  file names on the command line would fool darcs.\n    (issue273, Tommy Pettersson)\n\n
  \ * When recording with option --pipe, assume users local timezone if none is\n

  has already successfully updated\n    the inventory and the pristine cache, so the
  repository itself is not\n    corrupted. However, an incomplete update to the working
  directory results\n    in unintended differences between the working and pristine
  tree, looking\n    like spurious unrecorded changes. These can be easily removed
  with 'darcs\n    revert', but spurious changes have to be manually sorted out from
  real\n    unrecorded changes. By darcs no longer quiting at the first problem, more\n

  by cache-aware browsers much faste\n    in some cases. It also means that darcs.cgi
  can be usefully combined with\n    a cache-aware proxy for even better performance.
  (Will Glozer)\n\n  * New feature: more control over color and escaping in printed
  patches,\n    alternative color scheme, escaping of trailing spaces (Tommy Pettersson)\n\n
  \ * Fixed: fixed bug manifesting with failed createDirectory (David Roundy)\n\n
  \ * Internals: RT#255, several welcome refactors were made to the test suite,\n
  \   including comprehensible shell test script output, improved portability,\n    and
  easier maintenance. (Michael Schwern).\n\n  * New Feature: RT#245: Using --look-for-adds
  with 'whatsnew' implies\n    --summary. This should save some typing for the common
  case. (Karel\n    Gardas, Mark Stosberg)\n\n  * New Feature: RT#231: darcs gives
  better feedback now if you try to record\n    nonexistent files or directories.
  (Karel Gardas, Mark Stosberg)\n\n  * New feature: send accepts --sendmail-command
  that allows to customize the\n    command used for sending patch bundles (Benedikt
  Schmidt)\n\n  * Fixed: RT#266: Adding a non-existent dir and file gives the expected\n
  \   message now. (Tomasz Zielonka).\n\n  * Fixed: RT#10, a missed conflict resolution
  case. More accurately, we\n    noticed at had been fixed some point. A regression
  test for it was added.\n    (Tomasz Zielonka, Mark Stosberg)\n\n  * New feature:
  darcs tag can now accept the tag name on the command line\n    (RT#143). (Josef
  Svenningsson, Mark Stosberg, David Roundy)\n\n  * New feature: unrecord and unpull
  have a more powerful interface similar to\n    'darcs pull'. This allows for multiple
  patch selection. Coded by Tommy\n    Pettersson.\n\n  * Bug fix: RT#305: Removed
  '--patch' from the 'changes', which conflicted\n    with the new '--patches' option.\n\n
  \ * New feature: Automatically add parent directories for darcs add. (RT#20)\n    Coded
  by Benedikt Schmidt.\n\n  * Add helpful diagnostic message when there is a failure
  while pulling\n    (RT#201)\n\n -- Tomasz Zielonka <tomasz.zielonka@gmail.com>  Sun,

  instead of \"/home/.../darcs_repo\".\n  * Fixed flushing bug in darcs.cgi.\n  *
  Fixed commutation bug with renames and file adds/removals.\n  * Made --summary indicate
  conflicted changes.\n  * Fixed generation of extra hunk in diff algorithm.\n  *
  Added X-Mail-Originator header to emails sent by darcs.\n  * Fixed a couple of bugs
  in the resolve command.\n  * Added new cgi diff command to produce unified diff.\n
  \ * Notify when there are conflicts on push.\n  * Added 'a' key to say yes to all
  remaining changes for interactive\n    commands.\n  * Automatically generate AUTHORS
  file from repo history.\n  * Made pull --quiet actually quiet.\n  * Fixed bugs in
  whatsnew -ls, and distinguished between manually added\n    files and automatically

  (1.0.0rc2)\n\n  * Added support for comments in prefs files.\n  * Added new --enable-antimemoize
  compile option which reduces memory\n    usage at the expense of increased computational
  time.\n  * Added a new command:  \"reportbug\"\n  * Fixed a bug that prevented applying
  of a patch bundle to an\n    \"unoptimized\" repo.\n  * Fixed bug where asking for
  changes to a nonexistent file in a\n    subdirectory would show the patch that created
  or renamed that\n    subdirectory.\n  * Improved the robustness of unrevert.  Now
  actions that will make\n    unrevert impossible should warn the user.\n  * Fixed
  bug when moving files or directories to the root directory of\n    repo.\n  * Various
  changes to make the --logfile way of specifying the patch name\n    and comments
  in record more friendly:\n    - Allows editing of the long comment even when --logfile
  is specified,\n      if the --edit-long-comment option is also used.\n    - When
  editing the long comment, the change summary is included below\n      the actual
  text for reference, and the patch name is included in the\n      first line (and
  thus may be modified).\n    - The --logfile option is ignored if such a file doesn't
  exist.\n    - A --delete-logfile option was added, which tells darcs to delete the\n
  \     file after doing the record.  This is intended to allow you to stick\n      a
  --logfile=foo option in your defaults without accidentally\n      recording multiple
  patches with the same comments because you forgot\n      to modify it.\n  * Fixed
  bug leading to .hi files in tarball.\n  * Made ctrl-C work under windows, but only
  \"pure\" windows consoles, not\n    in cygwin shells or mingw's rxvt (room for improvement
  here).\n  * Fixed bug that led to curl not being tried when darcs is not compiled\n
  \   with libcurl.\n  * Added an environment variable DARCS_USE_ISPRINT for people
  who use\n    non-ascii characters in their files to indicate if the haskell standard\n
  \   library \"isPrint\" function works properly on their system (which\n    depends
  on locale).\n  * Reduced the number of hunks produced by the internal diff algorithm,\n
  \   when there are multiple equivalent ways of interpreting a change.\n  * Made
  the --from-{patch,tag,match} options inclusive, and added a\n    --{patch,match}
  option to diff (which was made easier to define by the\n    inclusiveness change,
  since --patch x is now equivalent to\n    --from-patch x --to-patch x).\n  * Added
  support for a second argument to get, which specifies the name of\n    the new directory.\n\n

  \ * improved error reporting in several situations.\n  * fixed bug when pulling

  \ Fri,  9 Apr 2004 07:19:34 -0400\n\ndarcs (0.9.18)\n\n  * added support for sending
  email from windows using the MAPI interface.\n    This code attaches the patch bundle
  in base64-encoded form, which darcs\n    can't currently decode (expect that in
  the next release), but the patch\n    bundle can be manually applied if a mail program
  does the decoding.\n  * renamed \"darcs push\" to \"darcs send\" and added a new
  \"darcs push\"\n    command roughly equivalent to the old \"darcs push --and-apply\".\n
  \ * removed support for setting up a test suite by simple creating a file\n    named
  \"darcs_test\".  You now should use setpref to define the test\n    suite command.\n
  \ * fixed some problems when working in a --partial repository.\n  * lots of code
  was cleaned up.  We have enabled the -Wall compiler flag\n    and are in the process
  of eliminating all the warnings.  This should\n    make the code more friendly to
  new developers, and also helps with the\n    next bullet point:\n  * improved handling
  of errors--informative failure messages are more\n    likely than they were before.\n
  \ * by default only check changes made since last checkpoint--this greatly\n    speeds
  up check.\n  * add --quiet option.  Some commands don't yet support this.  If\n
  \   there's a command you want to quiet down, let us know.\n  * several performance
  enhancements: improved SHA1 performance, faster\n    check and get on repositories
  with a long history and improved\n    performance with very large files.\n\n --

  ssh.\n    Also added a --and-apply-as that uses sudo to run the apply command as\n
  \   a different user.\n\n -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Mon, 10 Nov
  2003 07:08:20 -0500\n\ndarcs (0.9.13)\n\n  * Various performance enhancements.\n
  \ * add --pipe option to tag and record, which causes them to prompt for\n    all
  their input, including date.  This can be useful when creating\n    repository converters.\n
  \ * remove '-t' short command line option for '--to' and the '-o' short\n    option
  for '--reponame'.\n  * remove the darcs-patcher program.\n        The functionality
  of the darcs-patcher program is taken over by\n        the darcs apply command.
  \ Several fancy features have been added,\n        as described in the Apply section
  of the manual.\n  * support spaces and (maybe) unicode in filenames.\n  * updates
  to win32 support\n  * push via ssh\n  * add --without-libcurl option to configure\n
  \ * include DarcsURL in push email.\n  * add support for reading and writing gzipped
  patch files.\n  * allow multiple --to addresses on push, and also support --cc for\n
  \   additional addresses.\n  * when pulling or pushing from lastrepo, say where
  lastrepo is.\n  * only save lastrepo in get if the source repo wasn't a relative\n
  \   directory path.\n\n -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>\n\ndarcs (0.9.12)\n\n
  \ * add manual section on building darcs.\n  * improve scaling of checking for and
  resolving conflicts, which was an\n    O(n^2) function.\n  * escape ESC char when
  printing patches.\n  * don't reorder patches unless necesary--this avoids an O(n^2)
  operation\n    which was making a darcs record very slow when a lot of files were\n
  \   added.\n  * fix default regexps for boring file (Thanks Trevor!)\n  * replace
  now ignores files that aren't in the repo.\n  * make darcs add refuse to add files
  whose subdirectories don't exist.\n  * implement support for binary files.\n  *
  added support for running external programs to fetch files.\n  * fix conflict resolution
  bug from 0.9.11.\n  * make the patcher run the test prior to applying.\n  * add
  repo locking.\n  * Fix bug when pulling from a repo containing just one patch (thanks\n
  \   Peter).\n  * install cgi script in cgi-bin directory.\n\n -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>\n\ndarcs
  (0.9.11)\n\n  * A rewrite of the configure code and makefile (thanks to Peter Simons).\n
  \ * Added several new repository configuration options including a setpref\n    command
  which allows you to set preferences options that are pulled\n    from repo to repo.\n
  \ * Yet another rewrite of the merging code.\n  * User can now revert changes on
  a change-by-change basis.\n  * Yet another major improvement in speed and memory
  consumption.\n  * Add a darcs diff command to compare two versions.\n\n -- David
  Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Mon, 30 Jun 2003 06:42:10 -0400\n\ndarcs (0.9.10)\n\n
  \ * Added a way to configure the default values for options to darcs\n    commands.
  \ See Appendix B of manual.\n  * darcs push and pull now default to pulling and
  pushing from the most\n    recently accessed repository (if you don't specify a
  repo).\n  * Numerous bugfixes.\n\n -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Wed,
  21 May 2003 07:08:40 -0400\n\ndarcs (0.9.9)\n\n  * Created a way to have a \"centralized
  server\".  (See darcs-patcher\n    chapter in manual).\n  * Added new darcs-server
  package.\n  * Switch to new repository format.  Note that your repo will only be\n
  \   converted to the new format if you use certain commands such as\n    unpull.
  \ You can recognize the new format by the presence of a\n    _darcs/inventories/
  directory.\n  * Add the ability to sign patches sent with push using gnupg and to\n
  \   verify those signatures when applying.  (This is the authentication\n    basis
  for the above-mentioned server).\n  * Fix bug in application of a file rename patch.\n\n
  -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Thu,  8 May 2003 06:58:42 -0400\n\ndarcs
  (0.9.8)\n\n  * Fix rare bug in check when files happen to be a multiple of 1024
  bytes\n    in length.\n  * Fix bug in reading patch ids with long comments from
  local files.\n  * Prepare for a change in the repository format.  The format doesn't\n
  \   change for this version, but version 0.9.8 is able to read the new\n    repository
  format.\n\n -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Wed, 30 Apr 2003 08:54:18
  -0400\n\ndarcs (0.9.7)\n\n  * Fix a couple of rename conflict bugs.\n  * Add new
  test suite framework, along with several tests.\n  * Several major optimizations
  for speed and memory.\n  * Added --ignore-times option to not assume that when a
  file\n    modification time hasn't changed the file itself hasn't changed.\n\n --
  David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Sat, 26 Apr 2003 07:57:01 -0400\n\ndarcs
  (0.9.6)\n\n  * Fixed a couple of bugs in the merging of conflicting renames.\n  *
  Added an interface to include long comments when recording.\n  * Improve the interface
  of pull, allowing for viewing the patches before\n    pulling them.\n  * Include
  zsh command completion examples with docs.\n  * Massively improved responsiveness
  in command completion.\n  * Use packed strings to save memory.\n  * Fixed a bug
  that shows up in empty repos.\n  * Fixed multiple bugs in the mv command.\n\n --
  David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Thu, 17 Apr 2003 09:34:34 -0400\n\ndarcs
  (0.9.5)\n\n  * Improve merge of creation of files and directories with the same
  name.\n  * Add darcs push and apply commands, which are the beginning of work\n
  \   towards supporting a \"centralized server\" concept a la CVS.  However,\n    they
  are also useful for a \"Linus\" style workflow, based on emailing\n    patches.
  \ In theory they could also be used to provide a smart server\n    that could server
  pulls using less bandwidth.\n  * Add an unpull command analagous to unrecord, but
  which removes the\n    patches from the working directory also.\n  * Enable the
  mv command, since the mv patches have now been supported by\n    a couple of versions.\n
  \ * Include zsh_completion code, thanks to Aaron Denney <wnoise@ofb.net>.\n\n --
  David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Wed,  9 Apr 2003 07:52:01 -0400\n\ndarcs
  (0.9.4)\n\n  * Speed up whatsnew and record in the case where there are huge numbers\n
  \   of extra files in the working directory.\n  * Small (~10%) speedup in get.\n\n
  -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Fri,  4 Apr 2003 09:08:38 -0500\n\ndarcs
  (0.9.3)\n\n  * Optimized whatsnew and record by seting modification time of \"current\"\n
  \   files equal to that of working files if they are identical, so I won't\n    have
  to check again if the working one hasn't been changed.\n  * Rewrite file renaming
  code (no creation).\n  * Add support for replacing tokens in files.\n  * Make cgi
  output work more accurately, and point out which files were\n    modified by each
  patch.\n  * Add a caching feature to the cgi script to speed things up a bit.\n
  \ * Turn on creation of dependencies when recording.\n  * Add a 'tag' command.\n
  \ * Rewrote the 'pull' code to hopefully speed it up (and in any case to\n    greatly
  simplify it).\n\n -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Thu,  3 Apr 2003 07:08:05
  -0500\n\ndarcs (0.9.2)\n\n  * Add build dependency on tetex and latex2html\n  *
  Have internal diff code properly respond to deleted files and\n    directories.\n
  \ * Create file and directory rename patch types. (no creation--which\n    means
  that I am waiting to create commands to create such patches\n    until later, to
  avoid backward compatibility issues of repos.)\n  * Add support for patch dependencies.
  (no creation)\n  * Add support for token replacement patches. (no creation)\n\n
  -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Thu, 27 Mar 2003 07:59:09 -0500\n\ndarcs
  (0.9.1)\n\n  * Make darcs get --verbose actually be verbose (which is important\n
  \   because it takes so long that the user might be afraid it's hanging.\n  * Speed
  up the merge in complicated cases, possibly dramatically.\n  * Add a darcs remove
  command.\n\n -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>  Mon, 10 Mar 2003 09:48:55
  -0500\n\ndarcs 0.9.0\n\n  * Initial Release.\n\n -- David Roundy <droundy@abridgegame.org>

  About
  -----

  [Darcs](http://darcs.net) is a distributed version control system
  written in Haskell.

  Building
  --------

  To build and install the latest release, use

  ```
  cabal update && cabal install darcs
  ```

  with a recent cabal (version 3.2 or later is recommended). Any version of
  ghc from 8.2 up to 8.10 should work.

  From inside a clone or a source dist, use

  ```
  > cabal build
  ```

  or

  ```
  > cabal install
  ```

  If you prefer stack:

  ```
  > stack install
  ```

  Note that using stack will select older versions for some dependencies,
  which may mean that performance is slightly less than optimal.

  Running the test suite
  ----------------------

  This is optional, of course, but useful if you want to help find bugs or
  before you contribute patches.

  ```
  > cabal build --enable-tests
  > cabal test --test-show-details=direct
  ```

  Using
  -----

  To clone a repository via HTTP and send patches by mail:

  ```
  > darcs clone --lazy http://darcs.net
  > # edit files...
  > darcs add my_new_file
  > darcs record -m "my changes"
  > darcs send
  ```

  To clone via SSH and push patches:

  ```
  > darcs clone user@hub.darcs.net:user/repo
  > # edit files...
  > darcs add my_new_file
  > darcs record -m "my changes"
  > darcs push
  ```

  To create a project and start working:

  ```
  > darcs init my_project
  > cd my_project
  > # create and edit files...
  > darcs add my_new_file
  > darcs record -m "initial version"
  ```

  Pull new patches from upstream:

  ```
  > darcs pull
  ```

  Documentation
  -------------

  Concise and up-to-date documentation is available from darcs itself:

  ```
  > darcs help # list all commands
  > darcs help command # help for specific command
  > darcs command --help # dito
  ```

  The complete documentation is available as a man page which can be generated
  using

  ```
  darcs help manpage > darcs.1
  ```

  Reporting bugs
  --------------

  Please send bug reports to <bugs@darcs.net>. This will automatically add
  your report to the bug tracker. If you are unsure or just have a question or
  a comment, you can subscribe to darcs-users@darcs.net and post your question
  or comments there. See http://darcs.net/MailingLists for details.

  There is also an IRC channel named `#darcs` on freenode.net, where you can
  report problems or ask questions.


  Hacking
  -------

  We are happy to receive patches and will try our best to review them in a
  timely fashion. Just record your patches in a clone of
  <http://darcs.net/screened> and `darcs send` them. You are encouraged, but not
  required, to look at <http://darcs.net/Development/GettingStarted> for
  additional information.

  BTW, the wiki is a darcs repo, you can clone it with:

  ```
  > darcs clone --lazy http://darcs.net/darcs-wiki
  ```

  to edit the contents and send us patches.
