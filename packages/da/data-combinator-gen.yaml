  # Data Combinator Generator

  Generate a special combinator from any data type.

  https://hackage.haskell.org/package/data-combinator-gen-0.1.0.1

  ## Description

  This library provides a function to generate a special combinator from any data
  type (GADTs are not currently supported).

  This was inspired by the recursion-schemes library where they have a function to
  automagically generate a base functor. Although, this new base functor data type
  has custom constructors and to define the \*-morphism algebras turns into
  boring pattern matching.

  So, this library provides a function called `makeCombinator` that produces a
  nice combinator to deal with data types as they were defined in terms of Pairs
  (`(,)`) and Sums (`Either`). With this nice combinator we are able to view a
  data type as its equivalent categorical isomorphism and manipulate it with an
  interface similar as the `either` function provided from `base`.

  ## Example

  To create this special combinator you just need to call `makeCombinator ''<data
  type name>` as in the example below:

  ```Haskell

  -- List type
  data List a = Nil | List a (List a)

  makeCombinator ''List
  ```

  This example will generate the following code:

  ```Haskell
  makeCombinator ''ListF
    ======>
      listf f_acw7 f_acw8 Nil = f_acw7 ()
      listf f_acw7 f_acw8 (Cons a_acw9 a_acwa) = f_acw8 (a_acw9, a_acwa)
  ```

  As you can see it's pretty close as to have the type defined as the set of
  sums and pairs `data List a = Either () (a, List a)`, which we could then use
  `either` function as well as other convinent `(,)` combinators.

  An **important** note is that the generated function has always the same name as
  the data type but in low characters **and** the order of the functions to be
  applied to the type constructors it's the same order which they were declared.

  A simple example on how we can beneficiate from using this special combinator
  when defining catamorphisms using recursion-schemes:

  - Without the combinator:
    ```Haskell
    length :: [a] -> Int
    length = cata gene
      where
        gene Nil = 0
        gene (Cons a x) = x + 1
    ```

  - With the combinator:
    ```Haskell
    makeCombinator'' ListF

    length :: [a] -> Int
    length = cata (listf (const 0) (succ . snd))
    ```

  I recognize that for such a simple data type and catamorphism it's hard to see
  any gain in readability/implementation. But with this special combinator it's a
  lot easier to go from paper to code as it's almost a direct translation.

  There's a fully working example in the `examples` folder that uses the
  recursion-schemes library as well as a nice small program calculus (AoP
  inspired) combinators library to show how simple and straightforward it is to
  use it with this new combinator.
