description: "haskell-Data.Hash.Consistent\n============================\n\n## Data.Hash.Consistent\n\nA
  consistent hash is a technique to manage the fair distribution of cacheable\nentities
  among hosts. Each host identifier has its crc32 hash calculated\nand stored in a
  Vector along with its canonical host name. The host identifier\nmay be differentiated
  from its canonical host name by a multiplying factor,\nin our case a simple integer
  appeneded to the hostname to provide it with\na number of entries in the consistent
  hash, all evenly distributed. \n\nThis technique is explained in these links:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing\n\nhttp://www.tomkleinpeter.com/2008/03/17/programmers-toolbox-part-3-consistent-hashing/\n"
