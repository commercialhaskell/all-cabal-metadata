  # Revision history for data-elevator-forced

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- YYYY-mm-dd

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2023-04-14

  * Use a StrictValueExtractor instead of a raw Strict.

  This avoid a common pitfall where let bound destructuring will fallback to
  lazy semantics. This way we force the use to bound the two values with
  names. Any inconsistency will be reported by
  -Werror=unbanged-strict-patterns .

  * Use a strict tuple type called Pairy

  We have more oportunities to trigger evaluation like that.

  * Give a good tutorial

  I am pretty proud of it.
