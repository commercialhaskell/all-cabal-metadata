description: "DAG-Tournament\n==============\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nDAG-Tournament,
  where DAG stands for directed acyclic graph, is a graphical\nprogram to manage an
  informal tournament of games such as foosball. It is\ndesigned for open-for-all
  tournaments without schedule, for example to\nrecord all games as they happen in
  the free time program of a serious\nevent, such as a conference.\n\nGames can be
  entered as they happen. The program does not generate a\ncomplete ranking, but only
  visualizes what it knows about who is better\nthan who based on direct comparison,
  or a path of direct comparisons.\nCycles are broken at the edge of least significance.
  The visualisation is\nbaesd on springs and forces and updated in real time, already
  producing\nentertaining effects.\n\nDAG-Tournaments supports more than one tournament
  at the same time, e.g.\nfoosball and pool billard, and can switch between the two
  rankings with one\nkeypress, again showing an entaining shuffling of nodes until
  a stable\nstate is reached again.\n\nUsing\n-----\n\nDAG-Tournament has no configuration
  file and takes no command line optins.\nOnly if you want to handle more than one
  game at a time, you need to pass\nthe names of the games as command line parameters.\n$
  DAG-Tournament\nor\n$ DAG-Tournament Foosball Billard\n\nAt first, the screen will
  be blank, because no players or games have been\nadded. You can now interact with
  the game in these ways:\n\nDouble click\n\tAdd a new player. You will be asked for
  the name of the player.\n\nDrag’n’drop one player onto another\n\tAdd a new game
  result. You will be asked for the final score. If\n\tyour game does not have scores,
  just enter 1:0. \n\nTab\n\tSwitch between games, if you have more than one.\n\nHold
  shift\n\tShow the number of games per player. Useful to decide who ought to\n\tplay
  next.\n\nThese are sufficient to use the program. Additionally, there is\nfunctionality
  meant to be used by the tournament organizer:\n\nCtrl-R\n\tRe-set the position of
  the players. If the nodes are in a\n\tsomehow stuck and you expect that they are
  not yet in their optimal\n\tposition, this puts them all into a straigt line, possibly
  allowing\n\tthem to find a better possition on the screen. \n\nCtrl-E\n\tEdit the
  game state. This opens a text edit window with the list of\n\tplayers and games
  as a raw Haskell value. Here you can edit\n\tmistakes. If the result does not parse,
  it will be discarded, so\n\tedit with care!\n\n\tAfter each change to the game state
  (adding a new player, adding a\n\tgame result, or using Ctrl-E), it is written to\n\t~/.DAG-Tournamet.backup.
  If you need to resume the program, e.g.\n\tafter an accidential close or a crash,
  you can paste the contents\n\tof that file to the edit window provided by Ctrl-E\n\n\nExplanation
  of the screen contents\n----------------------------------\n\nPlayer names are sometimes
  coloured. These colours mean:\n\nRed\n\tCurrently hovered by the mouse. All games
  with this players are\n\tshown on the left.\nBlue\n\tStart of a drag action. Let
  go of the mouse above another player to\n\tenter a game.\nYellow\n\tA player that
  has already played at least against once against the\n\tplayer marked in red. Useful
  to find out who he has not yet played\n\tagainst.\n\nThe back arrows, usually pointing
  down, indicate that at the current\nstandings, the upper player is better than the
  lower, either by direct\ncomparision or a series of comparisions with intermediate
  players. Only a\nminimal amount of arrows are shown. So if there is an arrow from
  A to B and\nfrom B to C, there will not be an arrow from A to C, independently of\nwhether
  A and C have played each other.\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nDAG-Tournamet is © 2009 Joachim
