description: ! "This is a guide on how to get started with basic. Each commit to this
  repository represents a\nsingle step of the guide.\nWe'll cover the motivation and
  the general description of the library and how to use it,\nwhich consists of declaring
  your schema, generating the model and manipulating the data.\n\n### About\nBasic
  is a database library with 4 main objectives, roughly prioritized from first to
  last.\n\n#### Ease of use for the most common use cases\nWhile SQL allows for a
  large number of ways to manipulate your data, people use a small subset of them
  in the majority of cases.\n\nWe aim to make these cases as painless as possible.
  It should never feel like you need to jump through\nhoops to get a list of entities
  that satisfy a simple condition.\n\n#### Type safety\nThe type level constraints
  should reflect your data constraints as best as possible. The library should never
  allow you to execute a query that doesn't make sense. Expressivity must never come
  before safety.\n\n#### Flexibility\nWhile we provide an escape hatch for writing
  raw queries to ensure you're never \"stuck\", the cases where it's needed should
  be few and far in between. If there's a way to provide an elegant and safe solution
  for a specific query, the library should allow it.\n\n#### Ability to debug\nIf
  you mess up and/or something goes wrong we want to make it as easy as possible to
  fix it. Legible runtime errors are a must. Also, while Haskell libraries (especially
  the very \"type safe\" ones) are notorious for hard to understand compiler errors,
  we use custom type errors to try and cover some of the standard sources of mistakes.
  We try to provide useful descriptions of what went wrong and tips on how to fix
  it.\n\n### Getting started\nPrerequisites that are not covered by the tutorial:\n*
  A PostgreSQL installation\n* A database with a desired role configuration\n* A new
  stack project (simple template) with a dependency on basic that builds\n\nAs a database-first
  library, your model will come from an SQL schema. If you have an existing database,
  you can use tools like pg_dump to get the schema out. If you're developing a new
  database, you will declare your tables and relations in an SQL file and then use
  it to initialize the database and generate the basic model.\n\nStart off by creating
  a `./model/schema.sql` file. We'll be creating a rudimentary blog so we'll need
  an author and a post table.\n\n```SQL\nCREATE TABLE author (\n    id int not null
  primary key,\n    name text not null,\n    registration_date timestamp not null\n);\n\nCREATE
  TABLE post (\n    id int not null,\n    name text not null,\n    content text not
  null,\n    creation_date timestamp not null,\n    author int not null references
  author(id)\n);\n\n```\n\nLoad the schema into the database you created before. For
  example like this `psql -U postgres -d basic_guide -f model/schema.sql`\n\nNow it's
  time to generate the model. Create a new module in your `src` directory. Call it
  `Model`.\n\n```haskell\n{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell, DataKinds, FlexibleInstances,
  TypeFamilies, MultiParamTypeClasses #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric, FlexibleContexts
  #-}\nmodule Model where\n\nimport Data.Basic\n\nmkFromFile \"./model/schema.sql\"\n```\n\nAdd
  it to your cabal file.\n\nThis will generate all the declarations that you'll need
  to use the library. You will import this module from every module that requires
  access to the DB. To see the generated declarations, you can open the repl with
  `stack repl` and type `:browse Model`.\n\n### Manipulating data\nIn your main module,
  import the `Model` and `Data.Basic` so we can start playing with data.\nLet's start
  by inserting some data. All basic functions work in any monad with a `MonadEffect
  Basic` instance. Practically, this means it integrates well with a mtl-style codebase.\n\n```haskell\nsandbox
  :: MonadEffect Basic m => m ()\nsandbox = return ()\n```\n\nFor each table in your
  schema (say, author), basic will generate a new value called `newAuthor`. This represents
  a fresh table entry with no data. The underlying value is a record with one field
  for each column.\n\nBefore going futher, add dependencies to the `time`, `mtl`,
  `postgresql-simple` and `lens` libraries.\n\nBasic uses the lens approach extensively
  and setting the fields is no exception. Here's how you do it\n\n```haskell\n{-#
  LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts, OverloadedStrings #-}\nmodule Main where\n\nimport Prelude
  hiding (id)\nimport Model\nimport Data.Basic (MonadEffect, Basic)\nimport Data.Time
  (getCurrentTime, getCurrentTimeZone, getCurrentTime, utcToLocalTime)\nimport Control.Monad.IO.Class
  (MonadIO(..))\nimport Data.Function ((&))\nimport Control.Lens ((.~))\n\nsandbox
  :: (MonadEffect Basic m, MonadIO m) => m ()\nsandbox = do\n    zone <- liftIO getCurrentTimeZone\n
  \   now <- liftIO getCurrentTime\n    newAuthor\n        & id .~ 0\n        & name
  .~ \"John\"\n        & registrationDate .~ utcToLocalTime zone now\n        & print\n
  \       & liftIO\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = putStrLn \"hello world\"\n```\n\nLet's
  unpack this a bit. We first do a bit of `time` boilerplate to get the current `LocalTime`.
  Then we use the lens syntax to set fields. If you haven't seen it before, the pattern
  is `record & field .~ value`. This returns a new record so we can continue chaining.
  The `&` operator is actually the flipped version of `$` so we use it also to print
  the final value and lift that IO operation into our monad.\n\nNow, there's no instance
  `MonadEffect Basic IO` because the regular old `IO` monad doesn't know anything
  about your database. To handle that constraint we use the `handleBasicPsql` function.
  It takes a database connection which we can get using the `connectPostgreSQL` function
  provided by `postgresql-simple`. So what we do is `handleBasicPsql conn sandbox`
  and it will provide the database functionality that `sandbox` needs, take care of
  that constraint leaving only the `MonadIO` of which the `IO` monad is an instance.
  Here's the final version of our `Main` module.\n\n```haskell\n{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts,
  OverloadedStrings #-}\nmodule Main where\n\nimport Prelude hiding (id)\nimport Model\nimport
  Data.Basic (MonadEffect, Basic, handleBasicPsql)\nimport Data.Time (getCurrentTime,
  getCurrentTimeZone, getCurrentTime, utcToLocalTime)\nimport Control.Monad.IO.Class
  (MonadIO(..))\nimport Data.Function ((&))\nimport Control.Lens ((.~))\nimport Database.PostgreSQL.Simple\n\nsandbox
  :: (MonadEffect Basic m, MonadIO m) => m ()\nsandbox = do\n    zone <- liftIO getCurrentTimeZone\n
  \   now <- liftIO getCurrentTime\n    newAuthor\n        & id .~ 0\n        & name
  .~ \"John\"\n        & registrationDate .~ utcToLocalTime zone now\n        & print\n
  \       & liftIO\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n    conn <- connectPostgreSQL \"host=localhost
  port=5432 user=postgres dbname=basic_guide password=admin\"\n    handleBasicPsql
  conn sandbox\n```\n> make sure to modify the connection string\n\nAnd guess what,
  we can actually run the thing now! Compile the project and run it, you should see
  something like:\n```haskell\nEntity {_getEntity = Author {_author_id = 0, _author_name
  = \"John\", _author_registration_date = 2017-06-09 23:11:16.0531469}}\n```\n\nYou
  might complain that we didn't actually do anything with the database, and you're
  right, so let's actually insert this author in. How?\n\n```haskell\n    newAuthor\n
  \       & id .~ 0\n        & name .~ \"John\"\n        & registrationDate .~ utcToLocalTime
  zone now\n        & insert\n        & void\n```\n> add `insert` to the import list
  of `Data.Basic` and `import Control.Monad (void)`\n\nDoesn't get much simpler than
  that.\n\nHere's something cool. What if we forgot to set one of the required fields?
  Turns out, in basic, a partially filled in entity is a legitimate value. You can
  use the lens syntax to look at it's fields, you can even serialize it to JSON and
  back. The cool part is that you can't mess up by accessing an undefined field. Basic
  enforces this at the type level. Go ahead and try removing the `& name .~ \"John\"`
  line. When you try to compile it you should see something like\n\n```\n* Can't insert
  entity because the required field \"name\" is not set\n```\n\n### Querying data\nLet's
  start by inserting a bunch of rows so we have something to work with.\n\n```haskell\nsandbox
  :: (MonadEffect Basic m, MonadIO m) => m ()\nsandbox = do\n    zone <- liftIO getCurrentTimeZone\n
  \   now <- liftIO getCurrentTime\n    let localNow = utcToLocalTime zone now\n    newAuthor\n
  \       & id .~ 0\n        & name .~ \"John\"\n        & registrationDate .~ localNow\n
  \       & insert\n        & void\n\n    newAuthor\n        & id .~ 1\n        &
  name .~ \"Mark\"\n        & registrationDate .~ localNow\n        & insert\n        &
  void\n\n    newAuthor\n        & id .~ 2\n        & name .~ \"Steve\"\n        &
  registrationDate .~ localNow\n        & insert\n        & void\n\n    newPost\n
  \       & id .~ 0\n        & author .~ 0\n        & creationDate .~ localNow\n        &
  content .~ \"ABC\"\n        & name .~ \"ABC\"\n        & insert\n        & void\n\n
  \   newPost\n        & id .~ 1\n        & author .~ 1\n        & creationDate .~
  localNow\n        & content .~ \"DEF\"\n        & name .~ \"DEF\"\n        & insert\n
  \       & void\n\n    newPost\n        & id .~ 2\n        & author .~ 2\n        &
  creationDate .~ localNow\n        & content .~ \"GHI\"\n        & name .~ \"GHI\"\n
  \       & insert\n        & void\n```\n\nWhile, to ensure type safety, the types
  of basic functions are a bit hard to parse, you can follow a simplified mental model.
  What you do is pretend that every table is just a list of entries. To manipulate
  the data you use the analog of standard list functions (mapping, filtering, folding...)\n\nLet's
  get a list of all posts.\n\n```haskell\nposts <- allPosts -- Pretend `allPosts`
  has the type `[Post]`\n```\n\nHow about all posts with an id less than 2?\n\n```haskell\nposts
  <- dfilter (\\p -> (p ^. id) <. (2 :: Int)) allPosts\n```\n> `^.` is from lens,
  `dfilter` and `<.` are from `Data.Basic`\n\nWhat about sorting them by name? And
  maybe getting only the first one.\n\n```haskell\nposts <- dtake 1 $ dsortOn (^.
  name) $ dfilter (\\p -> (p ^. id) <. (2 :: Int)) allPosts\n```\n\nSome operations
  you can't do on lists, like deleting their content. Doing it in basic is easy. Filter
  the rows you want to delete and call `ddelete` on the whole thing.\n\n```haskell\nvoid
  $ ddelete $ dfilter (\\p -> p ^. id ==. (1 :: Int)) allPosts\n```\n\nYou can also
  update the values using the lens syntax like this\n\n```haskell\nvoid $ dupdate
  (\\p -> p & id .~ (2 :: Int)) $ dfilter (\\p -> p ^. id ==. (1 :: Int)) allPosts\n```\n\nWant
  to find the highest id of all posts?\n\n```haskell\nliftIO . print =<< dfoldMap
  (\\p -> Max (p ^. id)) allPosts\n```\n\nThings get more interesting with joins and
  groups. To join two tables you use the `djoin` function at the start and then pretend
  your working with a list of all possible pairs. For grouping, you use the `dgroupOn`
  function to choose which field(s) to group on. Pretend the signature is something
  like `dgroupOn :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [(b, [a])]`. You can then either map over that
  and fold the inner list (`dmap` and `dfoldMap`) or use the `dfoldMapInner` convenience
  functions with the pretend type signature `dfoldMapInner :: Monoid m => (a -> m)
  -> [(b, [a])] -> [(b, m)]`.\n\n```haskell\nres <-\n    dfoldMapInner (\\(p, a) ->
  Max (p ^. id)) $\n    dgroupOn (\\(p, a) -> a ^. id) $\n    dfilter (\\(p, a) ->
  p ^. author ==. a ^. id) $\n    djoin allPosts allAuthors\n```\n\nJoin all posts
  and authors, then filter the list so you're left with pairs (post, author of the
  post). Then group them by the author and, for each author, get it's highest post
  id.\n\nEntities also know if they're fresh or they came from the database. This
  let's you conveniently update single rows like this\n\n```haskell\n[a] <- dfilter
  (\\a -> a ^. id ==. (0 :: Int)) allAuthors\na & name .~ \"New name\"\n  & save\n
  \ & void\n```\n\nWhat it does is it looks for the database entry with the same primary
  key and updates all the other fields. This works if the table actually _has_ a primary
  key.\n"
