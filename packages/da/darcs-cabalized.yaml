description: |-
  Darcs is a revision control system, along the lines of CVS or arch.
  That means that it keeps track of various revisions and branches of
  your project, allows for changes to propagate from one branch to another.
  Darcs is intended to be an _advanced_ revision control system.
  Darcs has two particularly distinctive features which differ from other,
  centralized, revision control systems:

  * each copy of the source is a fully functional branch, and

  * underlying darcs is a consistent and powerful theory of patches.

  The Darcs repository can be found at <http://darcs.net/>.

  This is an unofficial package of Darcs, using Cabal; problems with it may well
  be the fault of the packager and not the Darcs project.
