                              darcs-monitor
                              -------------

  Darcs-monitor sends email to a specified recipient about every patch
  in the repository that it has not sent mail about yet.  It can be run from
  Cron or as a darcs apply posthook, whichever fits best your needs.

  It ought not be too hard to extend it for other kinds of notification than
  just emails; but no others are implemented at this time.

  There is a DarcsWiki page on darcs-monitor at
    http://wiki.darcs.net/RelatedSoftware/DarcsMonitor


                               Installation

  Darcs-monitor depends on mtl and HaXml.  First, make sure they are
  installed.

  Darcs-monitor is Cabalised.  The standard incantations

     runhaskell Setup.hs configure
     runhaskell Setup.hs build
     runhaskell Setup.hs install

  ought to work for most people.

  Darcs-monitor has been tested using GHC 6.12.1.  It might not work with
  older compilers; though patches are accepted for fixing any
  unportabilities.


                                  Usage

  In the following, I assume that the repository you want to monitor is
  in directory $REPO.

  To have darcs-monitor run every time someone pushes to the repository,
  create the file $REPO/_darcs/prefs/defaults with the following content:

  8<-- cut here --
  apply posthook darcs-monitor --charset=CHARSET email RECIPIENT [email RECIPIENT ...]
  apply run-posthook
  8<-- cut here

  In the above, CHARSET should be the MIME charset that patches
  (including their metadata) are in, and RECIPIENT should be the email
  address where emails should be sent. You can specify more than one recipient
  by repeating the email parameter. Also, if darcs-monitor is not
  installed in the default $PATH, you should specify th full path to the
  darcs-monitor binary.

  You can also run darcs-monitor from Cron or from the command line.  In
  those cases, it is easiest to specify the path to the repository on
  the command line after other arguments.  In fact, you can specify more
  than one.

  By default, mail is sent by calling /usr/sbin/sendmail.  Another sendmail
  binary can be specified by using a command-line switch.

  You can customise the email by providing a template.  The default one
  is installed in the Cabal-specified datadir as "default-template".
  You should put your own template in the file
  $REPO/_darcs/third-party/darcs-monitor/email-template
  (you can use other files, but then you have to specify where it is).

  In the template you can use the following substitutions:
    %RECIPIENT%   -- the email address to which email is sent
    %DIFF%        -- the Darcs-provided diff -u of the patch
    %CHANGES%     -- a Darcs-provided summary of changes
    %REPO%        -- the path to the repository
    %SHORTREPO%   -- the final component of the path to the repository
    %AUTHOR%      -- the patch author
    %DATE%        -- the patch date
    %HASH%        -- the patch Darcs hash
    %TITLE%       -- the patch name
    %COMMENT%     -- the patch comment

  Also, in the template, two percent signs in sequence (%%) start a comment
  that extends to the end of the current line.


                                  Thanks

  The following people, in addition to myself, have contributed code to
  this program:

    Benja Fallenstein
    Benjamin Franksen

  My thanks to them.


                                 Feedback

  Please send comments and bug reports to marcot@marcot.eti.br.

  Any patches should be prepared with Darcs against the repository
    http://marcot.eti.br/darcs/darcs-monitor/
  and sent using "darcs send".

  Have fun,
