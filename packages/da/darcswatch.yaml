  darcswatch

  Â© 2008-2010 Joachim Breitner <mail@joachim-breitner.de>

  This program tracks darcs patches and repositories, giving
  an overview over their state (applied or not applied).

  The patches are expected to come in via the mailfilter.sh
  program, which stores the patches in the appropriate place.

  The main program then downloads the repository inventories
  and compares the mailed patches against the repository. It
  summaries their status per submitter and per repository.

  The program expects a directory as a parameter and will read
  the config file therein for configuration. An example
  configuration is included.

  DarcsWatch uses modules from these non-standard packages:
   * xhtml
   * network
   * HTTP
   * Crypto
   * parsec
   * nano-md5
   * zlib
   * concurrentoutput
   * time
   * mime-string
   * regex-compat

  There are a lot of open issues, and help is very
  appreciated. A non exclusive list of TODO items is:

   * Nicer output (CSS magic!)
   * (Maybe) Add repositories per GnuPG signed command

  When committing patches, please make sure that they work with
  the version of GHC in the latest Debian stable release, at
  the moment ghc6.6, and compatible libraries.

  BTW, the simple darcs repository parsing code might be useful for
  other projects as well. I try to keep the patches for the Darcs.hs
  related stuff separate from the rest, so you can select them when
  "darcs pull"ing. If you also follow this procedure, we can share the
  Darcs.hs code between projects, by making sure our patches to these
  files can be shared without dragging in the rest of the project.
