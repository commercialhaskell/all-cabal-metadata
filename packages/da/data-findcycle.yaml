  # Revision history for data-findcycle

  ## 0.1.2.0 -- 2025-05-31

  * Correct unfortunate misspelling of "Nivasch" as "Nivash".
    New correctly named `nivasch*` functions were added. The old `nivash*` functions
    are deprecated and will be removed in 0.2.
  * Fix documentation rendering issue caused by the introduction of LANGUAGE CPP
    by removing CPP. Turns out it wasn't really necessary to start with.
  * Minor refactoring to improve test coverage.

  ## 0.1.1.0 -- 2025-04-24

  * Add `nivashPart` and `nivashPartWithinBounds` as variants of `nivash` using
    stack partitioning.
  * Minor documentation fixes and improvements.

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2025-03-08

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

description: |-
  Any function @f :: a -> a@ where the type @a@ has finitely many values
  eventually has to be cyclic when iterated from some initial @a@.

  This module provides a number of common algorithms and utilities to identify
  and work with such cycles.
