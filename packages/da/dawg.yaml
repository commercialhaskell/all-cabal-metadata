description: |-
  The library implements /directed acyclic word graphs/ (DAWGs) internally
  represented as /minimal acyclic deterministic finite-state automata/.

  The "Data.DAWG.Dynamic" module provides fast insert and delete operations
  which can be used to build the automaton on-the-fly.  The automaton from
  the "Data.DAWG.Static" module has lower memory footprint and provides
  static hashing functionality.
