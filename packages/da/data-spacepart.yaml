changelog: "    - Renamed Math.Geometry to Data.SpacePart.AABB\n    - Renamed Data.QuadTree
  to Data.SpacePart.QuadTree\n    - Added Data.SpacePart.QuadTree.query. Returns all
  elements that intersect a given boundary.\n    - The inclusive nature of the boundary's
  min extent should take precedence of the exclusive\n      nature of the max extent.\n
  \       Before this change many of the tests failed when boundaries of 0 area were
  involved. One case\n        that did not work was constructing a quadtree containing
  elements of 0 area. This change\n        corrected this.\n        The tests all_elements_inserted_query_prop
  and element_bounds_query_is_element_prop stil\n        fail if the element is of
  0 area. \n    - Cannot create quadtrees with initial bounds of 0 area.\n    - Removed
  requirement on elements being an instance of the Intersectable class. The only\n
  \     required instance is of Data.SpacePart.AABB.HasBoundary.\n    - Changed version
  number to 3000.B.C to follow the standard package version policy and be\n      greater
  than the previous date-based releases.\n    - Added some QuickCheck based checks.
  Run with test/run_verify\n    - Cleaned up the module exports.\n\n20090126.0\n    -
  Initial release.\n"

description: "This library is still in the early stages. Expect the interface to change.\n\nTODO:\n
  \   - rename Boundary data type \n    - rename HasBoundary type class.\n    - query
  should accept any suitable region. \n        - At least any axis aligned boxes not
  just square ones\n    - partition query into two forms:\n        - inclusive: Any
  element with bounds entirely within or partially the query bounds.\n        - exclusive:
  Any element with bounds entirely within the query bounds.\n    - Improve verification
  tests \n        - Test for proper distribution of inserted elements to nodes.\n
  \   - Improve visualization tool\n        - interactive querying\n        - interactive
  insert\n        - remove FBO dependency.\n\n    Optimization:\n        - The following
  element_bounds_query_is_element_prop instance takes a significant amount of\n          time:\n
  \       Boundary {boundary_corner = (-8.6,-25.0), boundary_size = 0.1875}\n        Boundary
  {boundary_corner = (-23.541666666666668,11.666666666666666), boundary_size = 20.7}\n\nverification:\n
  \   The script \"run_verify\" compiles and executes the Verify.hs program. This
  is done in such a way\n    that any data-spacepart package installed is hidden and
  the modules are sourced directly from\n    the src folder. \n    The Verify.hs program
  just runs whatever QuickCheck tests I have thrown together. For each\n    module
  under src there is a corresponding module under Verify that contains it's Arbitrary\n
  \   instances and verification properties.\n\n    The script \"run_visualize\" compiles
  and executes the QuadTreeVisualize program. This will be\n    compiled against the
  installed data-spacepart package. \n    The purpose of QuadTreeVisualize is to,
  well, visualize a random quadtree instance. in order to\n    run this program it's
  necessary to have OpenGL bindings that support FBO. I have a branch with\n    the
  required patches here:\n        http://www.tothepowerofdisco.com/repo/OpenGL/\n\n
  \   The controls are:\n        - arrow keys move left, up, right, down.\n        -
  Shift-up and shift-down zoom in and zoom out respectively.\n\n    This visualization
  program should not require the FBO dependency. However it was pulled from a\n    different
  visualization system which did require FBOs. Removing this dependency is on the
  TODO\n    list.\n\nThe version number of the library tries to follow the standard
  package version policy:\n    http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Package_versioning_policy\n\nwith
  the following addition: For the versiom number A.B.C.D D will be even for production
  releases\nand odd for development versions.\n\n"
