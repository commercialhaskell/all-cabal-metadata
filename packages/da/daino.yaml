description: "#  Daino: A Static Site Generator\nA static site generator designed
  by an academic to allow: \n\n- web pages written as [(Pandoc) markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown)
  (with YAML header for title etc.),\n- use a page layout inspired by [Tufte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte),\n-
  create publication list to download copies from `bibtex` database,\n- offer printable
  `pdf` files for all content,\n- web site using multiple languages with tools to
  facilitate text input,\n- content and appearances (theme) separated,\n- a single
  `yaml` file for setup, and \n- a self-contained result which can be hosted on any
  web server.\n\n## Software reuse:\nDaino is focused on software reuse. It uses  `pandoc`
  and other available packages on `Hackage` (e.g. shake, twitch, scotty), \n\nIt was
  influenced by Chris Penner's [slick](https://github.com/ChrisPenner/slick#readme),
  newer, and seemingly simpler is [`Ema`](`https://github.com/srid/ema`) by  Sridhar
  Ratnakumar, but the documentation did not detail its features neither how it is
  built.\n\nRelies on `git` for version management.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe code
  can be installed with cabal or stack from hackage. \n\nCompilation and linking brings
  in a large number of packages, e.g. Pandoc, and may take a while; on a typically
  AMD computer 30..60 Minutes, on a ARM64 (e.g. RaspberryPi4) four times as long for
  the initial installation. Rebuilding, however, is quick.\n\n# Example site\nThe
  example site [shown here](https://daino.gerastree.at) can be downloaded or cloned
  \  from `github` with `git clone git@github.com:andrewufrank/dainoSite`.\n\n\n#
  Running your own site\nCopying the folder `dainoSite` to a suitable directory and
  edit the `settinsNN.yaml` file found there is enough to start your own site with
  running `daino -qs` in this directory. The `ReadMe` shown in a browser with `localhost:3000`
  includes detailed instructions! \n\n"
