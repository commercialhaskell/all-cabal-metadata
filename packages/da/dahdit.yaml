  # dahdit

  Binary parsing and serialization with integrated size.

  This differs from `binary` in a few ways:

  * It is required that all types implementing `Binary` must also implement `ByteSized`.
  * Known-statically-sized types can implement `StaticByteSized` for size speedups.
  * Examining `Put` can yield required byte size without serializing.
  * It uses `ShortByteString` to avoid pinned memory.
  * It supports parsing `PrimArray` for fast copies of repeated chunks of primitive data.
  * Derivation uses `via` and not `anyclass` for better control of derived instances.
  * Provides several additional types representing fixed-length strings or sequences (using `TypeLits`).

  This generally works but should be considered experimental.
