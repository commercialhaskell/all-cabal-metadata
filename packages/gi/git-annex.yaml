synopsis: manage files with git, without checking their contents into git
changelog: "git-annex (10.20221212) upstream; urgency=medium\n\n  * Fix a hang that
  occasionally occurred during commands such as move,\n    when operating on unlocked
  files. (A bug introduced in 10.20220927)\n  * When youtube-dl is not available in
  PATH, use yt-dlp instead.\n  * Support parsing yt-dpl output to display download
  progress.\n  * init: Avoid scanning for annexed files, which can be lengthy in a\n
  \   large repository. Instead that scan is done on demand.\n  * Sped up the initial
  scan for annexed files by 21%.\n  * test: Add --test-debug option.\n  * Support
  quettabyte and yottabyte.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Mon, 12 Dec 2022 12:20:06
  -0400\n\ngit-annex (10.20221104) upstream; urgency=medium\n\n  * export: Fix a bug
  that left a file on a special remote when\n    two files with the same content were
  both deleted in the exported tree.\n  * S3: Support signature=anonymous to access
  a S3 bucket anonymously.\n    This can be used, for example, with importtree=yes
  to import from\n    a public bucket.\n    This feature needs git-annex to be built
  with aws-0.23.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Thu, 03 Nov 2022 14:07:31 -0400\n\ngit-annex
  (10.20221103) upstream; urgency=medium\n\n  * Doubled the speed of git-annex drop
  when operating on many files,\n    and of git-annex get when operating on many tiny
  files.\n  * trust, untrust, semitrust, dead: Fix behavior when provided with\n    multiple
  repositories to operate on.\n  * trust, untrust, semitrust, dead: When provided
  with no parameters,\n    do not operate on a repository that has an empty name.\n
  \ * move: Fix openFile crash with -J\n    (Fixes a reversion in 8.20201103)\n  *
  S3: Speed up importing from a large bucket when fileprefix= is set,\n    by only
  asking for files under the prefix.\n  * When importing from versioned remotes, fix
  tracking of the content\n    of deleted files.\n  * More robust handling of ErrorBusy
  when writing to sqlite databases.\n  * Avoid hanging when a suspended git-annex
  process is keeping a sqlite\n    database locked.\n  * Make --batch mode handle
  unstaged annexed files consistently\n    whether the file is unlocked or not. Note
  that this changes the\n    behavior of --batch when it is provided with locked files
  that are\n    in the process of being added to the repository, but have not yet
  been\n    staged in git.\n  * Make git-annex enable-tor work when using the linux
  standalone build.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Thu, 03 Nov 2022 14:07:31 -0400\n\ngit-annex
  (10.20221003) upstream; urgency=medium\n\n  * Avoid displaying warning about git-annex
  restage needing to be run\n    in situations where it does not.\n  * Fix the annex.adviceNoSshCaching
  config, which has never worked.\n    Thanks, Reiko Asakura\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>
  \ Mon, 03 Oct 2022 12:38:48 -0400\n\ngit-annex (10.20220927) upstream; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * Fix a bug in the last release that caused v8 repositories to upgrade\n    immediately
  to v10, rather than taking the scheduled 1 year to do so.\n  * annex.diskreserve
  default increased from 1 mb to 100 mb.\n  * Include the assistant and webapp when
  building with cabal 3.4.1.0.\n  * Merged the webapp build flag into the assistant
  build flag.\n  * Optimise linker in linux standalone tarballs.\n  * Fix crash importing
  from a directory special remote that contains\n    a broken symlink.\n  * When accessing
  a git remote over http needs a git credential\n    prompt for a password, cache
  it for the lifetime of the git-annex\n    process, rather than repeatedly prompting.\n
  \ * Use curl for downloads from git remotes when annex.url-options is set.\n  *
  Fix a reversion that made dead keys not be skipped when operating on\n    all keys
  via --all or in a bare repo.\n    (Introduced in version 8.20200720)\n  * vicfg:
  Include mincopies configuration.\n  * Improve handling of directory special remotes
  with importtree=yes whose\n    ignoreinode setting has been changed. When getting
  a file from such a\n    remote, accept the content that would have been accepted
  with the\n    previous ignoreinode setting.\n  * directory, adb: Fixed a bug with
  importtree=yes and multiple files\n    in the special remote have the same content,
  that caused it to\n    refuse to get a file from the special remote, incorrectly
  complaining\n    that it had changed, due to only accepting the inode+mtime of one
  file\n    (that was since modified or deleted) and not accepting the inode+mtime\n
  \   of other duplicate files.\n  * Fix a reversion that prevented git-annex from
  working in a\n    repository when --git-dir or GIT_DIR is specified to relocate
  the git\n    directory to somewhere else.\n    (Introduced in version 10.20220525)\n
  \ * Improved handling of --time-limit when combined with -J\n  * Fix updating git
  index file after getting an unlocked file \n    when annex.stalldetection is set.\n
  \ * restage: New git-annex command, handles restaging unlocked files.\n  * test:
  Added --test-with-git-config option.\n  * Run annex.freezecontent-command and annex.thawcontent-command\n
  \   when on a crippled filesystem.\n    Thanks, Reiko Asakura\n  * enable-tor: Fix
  breakage caused by git's fix for CVE-2022-24765.\n  * Let GIT_DIR and --git-dir
  override git's protection against operating\n    in a repository owned by another
  user.\n  * p2p: Pass wormhole the --appid option before the receive/send command,\n
  \   as it does not accept that option after the command\n  * Support \"inbackend\"
  in preferred content expressions.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Tue, 27 Sep
  2022 13:31:18 -0400\n\ngit-annex (10.20220822) upstream; urgency=medium\n\n  * v8
  repositories now automatically upgrade to v9, which will in turn\n    automatically
  upgrade to v10 in a year's time.\n    To avoid this upgrade, you can set annex.autoupgraderepository
  to false.\n  * Now uses v10 by default for new repositories.\n  * Fix a regression
  in 10.20220624 that caused git-annex add to crash\n    when there was an unstaged
  deletion.\n  * Added new matching options --want-get-by and --want-drop-by.\n  *
  Allow find --branch to be used in a bare repository, the same as\n    the deprecated
  findref can be.\n  * add --dry-run: New option. \n  * import: Avoid following symbolic
  links inside directories being\n    imported.\n  * Work around bug in git 2.37 that
  causes a segfault\n    when core.untrackedCache is set, which broke git-annex init.\n
  \ * Added annex.dbdir config which can be used to move sqlite databases\n    to
  a different filesystem than the git-annex repo, when the repo is on\n    a filesystem
  that sqlite does not work well in.\n  * Use curl when annex.security.allowed-url-schemes
  includes an url\n    scheme not supported by git-annex internally, as long as\n
  \   annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses is configured to allow using curl.\n  *
  Improve output when storing to bup.\n  * When bup split fails, display its stderr.\n
  \ * Avoid running multiple bup split processes concurrently, since\n    bup is not
  concurrency safe.\n  * Avoid starting an unnecessary number of git hash-object processes
  when \n    concurrency is enabled.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Mon, 22 Aug
  2022 11:56:06 -0400\n\ngit-annex (10.20220724) upstream; urgency=medium\n\n  * filter-process:
  Fix a bug involving handling of empty files,\n    that caused git to kill git-annex
  filter-process.\n  * add: Fix reversion when adding an annex link that has been
  moved to\n    another directory. (Introduced in version 10.20220624)\n  * Added
  annex.alwayscompact setting which can be unset to speed up\n    writes to the git-annex
  branch in some cases. See its documentation\n    for important notes on when it's
  appropariate to use.\n  * adb: Added configuration setting oldandroid=true to avoid
  using\n    find -printf, which was first supported in Android around 2019-2020.\n
  \   This may need to be enabled for old android devices that used to work\n    without
  it being set, since version 10.20220222 started using \n    find -printf.\n  * --backend
  is no longer a global option, and is only accepted by\n    commands that actually
  need it.\n  * Improve handling of parallelization with -J when copying content\n
  \   from/to a git remote that is a local path.\n  * S3: Avoid writing or checking
  the uuid file in the S3 bucket when\n    importtree=yes or exporttree=yes.\n  *
  Fix a reversion that prevented --batch commands (and the assistant)\n    from noticing
  data written to the journal by other commands.\n  * Fix building with the Assistant
  build flag disabled but the Webapp\n    build flag enabled.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>
  \ Mon, 25 Jul 2022 12:55:38 -0400\n\ngit-annex (10.20220624) upstream; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * init: Added --no-autoenable option.\n  * info: Added --autoenable option.\n
  \ * initremote: Improve handling of type=git special remotes.\n    The location
  value no longer needs to match the url of an existing\n    git remote, and locations
  not using ssh:// will work now, including\n    both paths and host:/path\n  * Fix
  retrival of an empty file that is stored in a special remote with \n    chunking
  enabled.\n    (Fixes a reversion in 8.20201103)\n  * move: Improve resuming a move
  that succeeded in transferring the\n    content, but where dropping failed due to
  eg a network problem, \n    in cases where numcopies checks prevented the resumed\n
  \   move from dropping the object from the source repository.\n  * add, fix, lock,
  rekey: When several files were being processed, \n    replacing an annex symlink
  of a file that was already processed\n    with a new large file could sometimes
  cause that large file to be\n    added to git. These races have been fixed.\n  *
  add: Also fix a similar race that could cause a large file be added\n    to git
  when a small file was modified or overwritten while it was\n    being added.\n  *
  add --batch: Fix handling of a file that is skipped due to being\n    gitignored.\n\n

  upstream; urgency=medium\n\n  * Special remotes with importtree=yes or exporttree=yes
  are once again\n    treated as untrusted, since files stored in them can be deleted
  or\n    modified at any time.\n    (Fixes a reversion in 8.20201129)\n  * Added
  support for \"megabit\" and related bandwidth units\n    in annex.stalldetection
  and everywhere else that git-annex parses\n    data units. Note that the short form
  is \"Mbit\" not \"Mb\" because\n    that differs from \"MB\" only in case, and git-annex
  parses units\n    case-insensitively.\n  * Special remotes using exporttree=yes
  and/or importtree=yes now\n    checksum content while it is being retrieved, instead
  of in a separate\n    pass at the end.\n  * fsck: Fix situations where the annex
  object file is stored in a\n    directory structure other than where annex symlinks
  point to.\n  * Deal with git's recent changes to fix CVE-2022-24765, which prevent\n
  \   using git in a repository owned by someone else.\n  * Improve an error message
  displayed in that situation.\n  * Prevent git-annex init incorrectly reinitializing
  the repository in\n    that situation.\n  * test: When limiting tests to run with
  -p, work around tasty limitation\n    by automatically including dependent tests.\n\n

  upstream; urgency=medium\n\n  * Ignore annex.numcopies set to 0 in gitattributes
  or git config,\n    or by git-annex numcopies or by --numcopies, since that\n    configuration
  would make git-annex easily lose data. \n    Same for mincopies.\n  * assistant:
  When annex.autocommit is set, notice commits that\n    the user makes manually,
  and push them out to remotes promptly.\n  * multicast: Support uftp 5.0 by switching
  from aes256-cbc to\n    aes256-gcm.\n  * Fix test failure on NFS when cleaning up
  gpg temp directory.\n  * Fix a build failure with ghc 9.2.2.\n    Thanks, gnezdo
  for the patch.\n  * rsync 3.2.4 broke backwards-compatability by preventing exposing\n
  \   filenames to the shell. Made the rsync and gcrypt special remotes\n    detect
  this and disable shellescape. Closes: #1010397\n  * repair: Avoid treating refs/annex/last-index
  or other refs that\n    are not commit objects as evidence of repository corruption.\n\n

  upstream; urgency=medium\n\n  * Directory special remotes with importtree=yes have
  changed to once more \n    take inodes into account. This will cause extra work
  when importing\n    from a directory on a FAT filesystem that changes inodes on
  every\n    mount. To avoid that extra work, set ignoreinodes=yes when initializing\n
  \   a new directory special remote, or change the configuration of your\n    existing
  remote:\n      git-annex enableremote foo ignoreinodes=yes\n  * add: Avoid unncessarily
  converting a newly unlocked file to be stored\n    in git when it is not modified,
  even when annex.largefiles does not\n    match it.\n  * The above change to add
  fixes a reversion in version 10.20220222,\n    where git-annex unlock followed by
  git-annex add, followed by git\n    commit file could result in git thinking the
  file was modified\n    after the commit.\n  * Detect when an unlocked file whose
  content is not present has gotten\n    some other content appended to it, and avoid
  treating it as a pointer\n    file, so that appended content will not be checked
  into git, but will\n    be annexed like any other file.\n  * smudge: Warn when encountering
  a pointer file that has other content\n    appended to it.\n  * When annex.freezecontent-command
  is set, and the filesystem does not\n    support removing write bits, avoid treating
  it as a crippled\n    filesystem.\n  * Run annex.thawcontent-command before deleting
  an object file,\n    in case annex.freezecontent-command did something that would
  prevent\n    deletion.\n  * Fix propagation of nonzero exit status from git ls-files
  when a specified\n    file does not exist, or a specified directory does not contain\n
  \   any files checked into git.\n  * Fix build with aeson 2.0.\n    Thanks, sternenseemann
  for the patch.\n  * Avoid git-annex test being very slow when run from within the\n
  \   standalone linux tarball or OSX app.\n  * test: Runs tests in parallel to speed
  up the test suite.\n  * test: Added --jobs option.\n  * Removed vendored copy of
  http-client-restricted, and removed the\n    HttpClientRestricted build flag that
  avoided that dependency.\n  * Removed the NetworkBSD build flag.\n\n -- Joey Hess

  urgency=medium\n\n  * annex.skipunknown now defaults to false, so commands like\n
  \   `git annex get foo*` will not silently skip over files/dirs that are\n    not
  checked into git.\n  * info: Allow using matching options in more situations. File
  matching\n    options like --include will be rejected in situations where there
  is\n    no filename to match against.\n  * adb: Avoid find failing with \"Argument
  list too long\"\n  * Fix git-annex forget propagation between repositories.\n    (reversion
  introduced in version 7.20190122)\n  * registerurl, unregisterurl: Improved output
  when reading from stdin\n    to be more like other batch commands.\n  * registerurl,
  unregisterurl: Added --json and --json-error-messages options.\n  * Avoid git status
  taking a long time after git-annex unlock of many files.\n  * Pass --no-textconv
  when running git diff internally.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Tue, 22 Feb
  2022 13:01:20 -0400\n\ngit-annex (10.20220127) upstream; urgency=medium\n\n  * New
  v10 repository version (with v9 as a stepping-stone to it).\n    v8 remains the
  default version for now.\n  * In v10, object files are locked using separate lock
  files. This allows\n    the object files to be kept non-writable even in repositories
  where\n    core.sharedRepository is set.\n  * The v10 upgrade will happen automatically,
  one year after the v9\n    upgrade, in order to allow time for any old git-annex
  processes that\n    are not aware of the locking change to finish. Or git-annex
  upgrade\n    can be used to upgrade to v10 immediately.\n  * In v9 upgrade, set
  filter.annex.process. This makes git add/checkout faster\n    when there are a lot
  of unlocked annexed files or non-annexed files, but can\n    also make git add of
  large files to the annex somewhat slower.\n    If this tradeoff does not work for
  your use case, you can still unset\n    filter.annex.process.\n  * export: When
  a non-annexed symlink is in the tree to be exported, skip it.\n  * import: When
  the previously exported tree contained a non-annexed symlink,\n    preserve it in
  the imported tree so it does not get deleted.\n  * enableremote, renameremote: Better
  handling of the unusual case where\n    multiple special remotes have been initialized
  with the same name.\n  * Recover from corrupted content being received from a git
  remote,\n    by deleting the temporary file when it fails to verify. This prevents\n
  \   a retry from failing again. \n    (reversion introduced in version 8.20210903)\n
  \ * adb: Added ignorefinderror configuration parameter.\n  * Avoid crashing when
  run in a bare git repo that somehow contains an\n    index file.\n  * Reject combinations
  of --batch (or --batch-keys) with options like\n    --all or --key or with filenames.\n\n

  upstream; urgency=medium\n\n  * Improved support for using git-annex in a read-only
  repository,\n    git-annex branch information from remotes that cannot be merged
  into\n    the git-annex branch will now not crash it, but will be merged in\n    memory.\n
  \ * addurl, youtube-dl: When --check-raw prevents downloading an url,\n    still
  continue with any downloads that come after it, rather than\n    erroring out.\n
  \ * Fix locking problems when annex.pidlock is set and concurrency is\n    enabled
  eg with -J.\n  * Improve error message display when autoinit fails due to eg, a\n
  \   permissions problem.\n  * export: Avoid unncessarily re-exporting non-annexed
  files that were\n    already exported.\n  * Improve git command queue flushing so
  that eg, addurl of several\n    large files that take time to download will update
  the index for each\n    file, rather than deferring the index updates to the end.\n
  \ * sync: Better error message when unable to export to a remote because\n    remote.name.annex-tracking-branch
  is configured to a ref that does not\n    exist.\n  * Fix build with ghc 9.0.1\n
  \ * Fix build with old versions of feed library.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>

  \ * Bugfix: When -J was enabled, getting files could leak an\n    ever-growing number
  of git cat-file processes.\n  * Support git's new \"ort\" resolver, which became
  the default in git 2.34.0,\n    and broke the test suite and automatic merge resolution
  of a conflict\n    between an annexed file and a non-annexed file.\n  * importfeed:
  Display url before starting youtube-dl download.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>
  \ Tue, 23 Nov 2021 15:19:16 -0400\n\ngit-annex (8.20211117) upstream; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * filter-process: New command that can make git add/checkout faster when\n    there
  are a lot of unlocked annexed files or non-annexed files, but that\n    also makes
  git add of large annexed files slower. Use it by running:\n    git config filter.annex.process
  'git-annex filter-process'\n  * Fix a typo in the name of youtube-dl\n    (reversion
  introduced in version 8.20210903)\n  * git-lfs: Fix interoperability with gitlab's
  implementation of the\n    git-lfs protocol, which requests Content-Encoding chunked.\n
  \ * importfeed: Fix a crash when used in a non-unicode locale.\n  * migrate: New
  --remove-size option.\n  * uninit: Avoid error message when no commits have been
  made to the\n    repository yet.\n  * uninit: Avoid error message when there is
  no git-annex branch.\n  * metadata --batch: Avoid crashing when a non-annexed file
  is input,\n    instead output a blank line like other batch commands do.\n  * metadata
  --batch --json: Reject input whose \"fields\" does not consist\n    of arrays of
  strings. Such invalid input used to be silently ignored.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>
  \ Wed, 17 Nov 2021 12:18:49 -0400\n\ngit-annex (8.20211028) upstream; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * Removed support for accessing git remotes that use versions of\n    git-annex
  older than 6.20180312.\n  * git-annex-shell: Removed several commands that were
  only needed to\n    support git-annex versions older than 6.20180312.\n  * Negotiate
  P2P protocol version with tor remotes, allowing\n    use of protocol version 1.
  This negotiation is not supported\n    by versions of git-annex older than 6.20180312.\n
  \ * Fix bug that caused stale git-annex branch information to read\n    when annex.private
  or remote.name.annex-private is set.\n  * git-annex get when run as the first git-annex
  command in a new repo\n    did not populate all unlocked files.\n    (Reversion
  in version 8.20210621)\n  * Fix using lookupkey and info inside a subdirectory of
  the git repository.\n    (Reversion in version 8.20211011)\n  * Avoid some sqlite
  crashes on Windows SubSystem for Linux (WSL).\n  * Call annex.freezecontent-command
  on the annex object file\n    after it has been moved into place in annex/objects/.
  This allows\n    the hook to freeze the file in ways that prevent moving it, such
  as\n    removing the Windows delete permission.\n    Thanks, Reiko Asakura.\n  *
  addurl: Support adding the same url to multiple files at the same\n    time when
  using -J with --batch --with-files.\n  * When retrieval from a chunked remote fails,
  display the error that\n    occurred when downloading the chunk, rather than the
  error that\n    occurred when trying to download the unchunked content, which is
  less\n    likely to actually be stored in the remote.\n  * Avoid crashing tilde
  expansion on user who does not exist.\n  * test: Put gpg temp home directory in
  system temp directory,\n    not filesystem being tested.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>
  \ Thu, 28 Oct 2021 11:58:29 -0400\n\ngit-annex (8.20211011) upstream; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * Added annex.bwlimit and remote.name.annex-bwlimit config to limit\n    the bandwidth
  of transfers. It works for git remotes and many\n    but not all special remotes.\n
  \ * Bug fix: Git configs such as annex.verify were incorrectly overriding\n    per-remote

  upstream; urgency=medium\n\n  * Added httpalso special remote, which is useful for
  accessing \n    content stored on other remotes that is published by http.\n  *
  The external special remote protocol got an ASYNC extension.\n    This can be used
  by an external special remote to let a single process\n    perform concurrent actions,
  rather than multiple processes being\n    started, when that is more efficient.\n
  \ * Retry transfers to exporttree=yes remotes same as for other remotes.\n  * import:
  Retry downloads that fail, same as is done for downloads generally.\n  * Limit retrying
  of failed transfers when forward progress is being made\n    to 5, to avoid some
  unusual edge cases where too much retrying could\n    result in far more data transfer
  than makes sense.\n  * Exposed annex.forward-retry git config, to configure the
  forward retry\n    behavior that git-annex has had for a long time.\n  * sync, assistant,
  merge: When merge.directoryRenames is not set,\n    default it it to \"false\",
  which works better with automatic merge\n    conflict resolution than git's ususual
  default of \"conflict\".\n    (This is not done when automatic merge conflict resolution
  is disabled.)\n  * resolvemerge: Improve cleanup of cruft left in the working tree
  \n    by a conflicted merge.\n  * Support git remotes where .git is a file, not
  a directory,\n    eg when --separate-git-dir was used.\n  * Fixed several cases
  where files were created without file mode bits\n    that the umask would usually
  set. This included exports to the\n    directory special remote, torrent files used
  by the bittorrent special\n    remote, hooks written by git-annex init, and some
  log files in .git/annex/\n  * Fix reversion in 7.20190322 that made addurl --file
  not be honored\n    when youtube-dl was used to download media.\n  * Fix reversion

  external special remote does not start up\n    properly, or is not usable.\n  *
  Display a message when git-annex has to wait for a pid lock file\n    held by another

  \ * Fix reversion that broke passing annex.* and remote.*.annex-*\n    git configs

  special remote programs should not block SIGINT or\n    SIGTERM.\n  * Avoid creating

  special remote onto a vfat\n    filesystem.\n  * S3: The REDUCED_REDUNDANCY storage
  class is no longer cheaper so\n    stop documenting it, and stop offering it as

  the default for now. While v6 was always experimental\n    to some degree, its successor
  v7 is ready for production use!\n    http://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/unlocked_files/\n
  \ * Direct mode repositories are deprecated; they have many problems\n    that v7
  fixes, so upgrading them now is recommended (but not yet\n    required): git annex
  upgrade --version=7\n  * init: When in a crippled filesystem, initialize a v7 repository\n

  At long last there's a way to hide annexed files whose content\n    is missing from
  the working tree: git-annex adjust --hide-missing\n    See https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/hiding_missing_files/\n
  \ * When already in an adjusted branch, running git-annex adjust\n    again will
  update the branch as needed. This is mostly\n    useful with --hide-missing to hide/unhide
  files after their content\n    has been dropped or received.\n  * git-annex sync
  --content supports --hide-missing; it can\n    be used to get the content of hidden
  files, and it updates the\n    adjusted branch to hide/unhide files as necessary.\n
  \ * smudge: The smudge filter no longer provides git with annexed\n    file content,
  to avoid a git memory leak, and because that did not\n    honor annex.thin. Now
  git annex smudge --update has to be run\n    after a checkout to update unlocked
  files in the working tree \n    with annexed file contents.\n  * v7 init, upgrade:
  Install git post-checkout and post-merge hooks that run \n    git annex smudge --update.\n
  \ * precommit: Run git annex smudge --update, because the post-merge\n    hook is
  not run when there is a merge conflict. So the work tree will\n    be updated when
  a commit is made to resolve the merge conflict.\n  * Note that git has no hooks
  run after git stash or git cherry-pick,\n    so the user will have to manually run
  git annex smudge --update\n    after such commands.\n  * Removed the old Android
  app.\n  * Removed support for building with very old ghc < 8.0.1,\n    and with

  \ * New protocol for communicating with git-annex-shell increases speed\n    of
  operations involving ssh remotes. When not transferring large files,\n    git-annex
  is between 200% and 400% faster using the new protocol,\n    and it's just as fast
  as before when transferring large files.\n    (When the remote has an old git-annex-shell,
  git-annex falls back\n    to the old slower code. This fallback is planned to be
  removed \n    after 5 years or so.)\n  * Note that, due to not using rsync to transfer
  files over ssh\n    any longer, permissions and other file metadata of annexed files\n
  \   will no longer be preserved when copying them to and from ssh remotes.\n    Other
  remotes never supported preserving that information, so\n    this is not considered
  a regression.\n  * Fix data loss bug in content locking over tor, when the remote\n
  \   repository is in direct mode, it neglected to check that the content\n    was
  actually present when locking it. This could cause git annex drop\n    to remove
  the only copy of a file when it thought the tor remote had\n    a copy.\n  * Fix
  data loss bug when the local repository uses direct mode, and a\n    locally modified
  file is dropped from a remote repsitory. The bug\n    caused the modified file to
  be counted as a copy of the original file.\n    (This is not a severe bug because
  in such a situation, dropping\n    from the remote and then modifying the file is
  allowed and has the same\n    end result.)\n  * Some downloads will be verified,
  even when annex.verify=false.\n    This is done in some edge cases where there's
  a likelyhood than an\n    object was downloaded incorrectly.\n  * Support exporttree=yes
  for rsync special remotes.\n  * Added backends for the BLAKE2 family of hashes,
  when built with\n    a new enough version of cryptonite.\n  * Improve SHA*E extension
  extraction code to not treat parts of the\n    filename that contain punctuation
  or other non-alphanumeric characters\n    as extensions. Before, such characters
  were filtered out.\n  * Better ssh connection warmup when using -J for concurrency.\n
  \   Avoids ugly messages when forced ssh command is not git-annex-shell.\n  * Fix
  race condition in ssh warmup that caused git-annex to get\n    stuck and never process
  some files when run with high levels of\n    concurrency.\n  * Fix reversion introduced
  in 6.20171214 that caused concurrent\n    transfers to incorrectly fail with \"transfer
  already in progress\".\n  * Note that Remote/Git.hs now contains AGPL licensed code,\n
  \   thus the license of git-annex as a whole is AGPL. This was already\n    the
  case when git-annex was built with the webapp enabled.\n  * Include amount of data
  transferred in progress display.\n  * Dial back optimisation when building on arm,

  was also passed.\n  * status: Propigate nonzero exit code from git status.\n  *
  Linux standalone builds put the bundled ssh last in PATH,\n    so any system ssh

  cloned repository,\n    where \"merging\" messages were included in the output of
  configlist\n    (and perhaps other commands) and caused a \"Failed to get annex.uuid\n
  \   configuration\" error.\n  * Support GIT_SSH and GIT_SSH_COMMAND, which are handled
  close the same\n    as they are by git. However, unlike git, git-annex sometimes

  \ * Cryptographically secure hashes can be forced to be used in a\n    repository,
  by setting annex.securehashesonly.\n    This does not prevent the git repository
  from containing links\n    to insecure hashes, but it does prevent the content of
  such files\n    from being added to .git/annex/objects by any method.\n  * Tighten
  key parser to prevent SHA1 collision attacks generating\n    two keys that have
  the same SHA1. (Only done for keys that contain\n    a hash). This ensures that
  signed git commits of annexed files\n    will remain secure, as long as git-annex
  is using a secure hashing\n    backend.\n  * fsck: Warn about any files whose content
  is present, that don't\n    use secure hashes, when annex.securehashesonly is set.\n
  \ * init: When annex.securehashesonly has been set with git-annex config,\n    copy
  that value to the annex.securehashesonly git config.\n  * Added --securehash option
  to match files using a secure hash function,\n    and corresponding securehash preferred
  content expression.\n  * sync, merge: Fail when the current branch has no commits
  yet, instead\n    of not merging in anything from remotes and appearing to succeed.\n
  \ * Run ssh with -n whenever input is not being piped into it,\n    to avoid it
  consuming stdin that it shouldn't.\n    This fixes git-annex-checkpresentkey --batch
  remote,\n    which didn't output results for all keys passed into it. Other\n    git-annex
  commands that communicate with a remote over ssh may also\n    have been consuming
  stdin that they shouldn't have, which could have\n    impacted using them in eg,
  shell scripts.\n  * sync: Improve integration with receive.denyCurrentBranch=updateInstead,\n
  \   displaying error messages from the remote then it fails to update\n    its checked
  out branch.\n  * Added post-recieve hook, which makes updateInstead work with direct\n
  \   mode and adjusted branches.\n  * init: Set up the post-receive hook.\n  * sync:
  When syncing with a local repository located on a crippled\n    filesystem, run
  the post-receive hook there, since it wouldn't get run\n    otherwise. This makes
  pushing to repos on FAT-formatted removable\n    drives update them when receive.denyCurrentBranch=updateInstead.\n
  \ * config group groupwanted numcopies schedule wanted required: \n    Avoid displaying
  extraneous messages about repository auto-init,\n    git-annex branch merging, etc,
  when being used to get information.\n  * adjust: Fix behavior when used in a repository
  that contains\n    submodules.\n  * Run wget with -nv instead of -q, so it will
  display HTTP errors.\n  * Run curl with -S, so HTTP errors are displayed, even when\n
  \   it's otherwise silent.\n  * When downloading in --json or --quiet mode, use
  curl in preference\n    to wget, since curl is able to display only errors to stderr,
  unlike\n    wget.\n  * status: Pass --ignore-submodules=when option on to git status.\n
  \ * config --set: As well as setting value in git-annex branch,\n    set local gitconfig.
  This is needed especially for\n    annex.securehashesonly, which is read only from
  local gitconfig and not\n    the git-annex branch.\n  * Removed support for building
  with the old cryptohash library.\n    Building with that library made git-annex
  not support SHA3; it's time\n    for that to always be supported in case SHA2 dominoes.\n
  \ * git-annex.cabal: Make crypto-api a dependency even when built w/o\n    webapp
  and test suite.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:39:47 -0400\n\ngit-annex

  from 200 to 1000.\n    This makes git-annex prefer transferring data from special\n
  \   remotes when possible.\n  * Remove -j short option for --json-progress; that
  option was already\n    taken for --json.\n  * vicfg: Include the numcopies configuation.\n
  \ * config: New command for storing configuration in the git-annex branch.\n  *
  annex.autocommit can be configured via git-annex config, to control\n    the default
  behavior in all clones of a repository.\n  * New annex.synccontent config setting,
  which can be set to true to make\n    git annex sync default to --content. This
  may become the default at\n    some point in the future. As well as being configuable
  by git config,\n    it can be configured by git-annex config to control the default\n
  \   behavior in all clones of a repository.\n  * stack.yaml: Update to lts-7.18.\n
  \ * Some optimisations to string splitting code.\n  * unused: When large files are
  checked right into git, avoid buffering\n    their contents in memory.\n  * unused:
  Improved memory use significantly when there are a lot\n    of differences between
  branches.\n  * Wormhole pairing will start to provide an appid to wormhole on\n
  \   2021-12-31. An appid can't be provided now because Debian stable is going\n
  \   to ship a older version of git-annex that does not provide an appid.\n    Assumption
  is that by 2021-12-31, this version of git-annex will be\n    shipped in a Debian
  stable release. If that turns out to not be the\n    case, this change will need
  to be cherry-picked into the git-annex in\n    Debian stable, or its wormhole pairing
  will break.\n  * Fix build with aws 0.16. Thanks, aristidb.\n  * assistant: Make
  --autostart --foreground wait for the children it\n    starts. Before, the --foreground
  was ignored when autostarting.\n  * initremote: When a uuid= parameter is passed,
  use the specified\n    UUID for the new special remote, instead of generating a
  UUID.\n    This can be useful in some situations, eg when the same data can be\n
  \   accessed via two different special remote backends.\n  * import: Changed how
  --deduplicate, --skip-duplicates, and\n    --clean-duplicates determine if a file
  is a duplicate.\n    Before, only content known to be present somewhere was considered\n
  \   a duplicate. Now, any content that has been annexed before will be\n    considered
  a duplicate, even if all annexed copies of the data have\n    been lost.\n    Note
  that --clean-duplicates and --deduplicate still check\n    numcopies, so won't delete
  duplicate files unless there's an annexed\n    copy.\n  * import: --deduplicate
  and --skip-duplicates were implemented\n    inneficiently; they unncessarily hashed
  each file twice. They have\n    been improved to only hash once.\n  * import: Added
  --reinject-duplicates.\n  * Added git template directory to Linux standalone tarball
  and OSX\n    app bundle.\n  * Improve pid locking code to work on filesystems that
  don't support hard\n    links.\n  * S3: Fix check of uuid file stored in bucket,

  been removed from the assistant in this release.\n    If your repositories used
  XMPP to keep in sync, that will no longer\n    work, and you should enable some
  other remote to keep them in sync.\n    A ssh server is one way, or use the new
  Tor pairing feature.\n  * p2p --pair makes it easy to pair repositories, over Tor,
  using\n    Magic Wormhole codes to find the other repository.\n    See http://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/peer_to_peer_network_with_tor/\n
  \ * webapp: The \"Share with a friend\" and \"Share with your other devices\"\n
  \   pages have been changed to pair repositories using Tor and Magic Wormhole.\n
  \ * metadata --batch: Fix bug when conflicting metadata changes were\n    made in
  the same batch run.\n  * Pass annex.web-options to wget and curl after other options,
  so that\n    eg --no-show-progress can be set by the user to disable the default\n
  \   --show-progress.\n  * Revert ServerAliveInterval change in 6.20161111, which
  caused problems\n    with too many old versions of ssh and unusual ssh configurations.\n
  \   It should have not been needed anyway since ssh is supposted to\n    have TCPKeepAlive
  enabled by default.\n  * Make all --batch input, as well as fromkey and registerurl
  stdin\n    be processed without requiring it to be in the current encoding.\n  *
  p2p: --link no longer takes a remote name, instead the --name\n    option can be
  used.\n  * Linux standalone: Improve generation of locale definition files,\n    supporting
  locales such as en_GB.UTF-8.\n  * rekey --force: Incorrectly marked the new key's
  content as being\n    present in the local repo even when it was not.\n  * enable-tor:
  Put tor sockets in /var/lib/tor-annex/, rather\n    than in /etc/tor/hidden_service/.\n
  \ * enable-tor: No longer needs to be run as root.\n  * enable-tor: When run as

  allows nicely displayed messages when using the -J flag.\n  * Additional commands
  now support the -J flag: \n    fsck, drop, add, addurl, import\n  * import: Avoid
  very ugly error messages when the directory files\n    are imported to is not a
  directort, but perhaps an annexed file.\n  * Concurrent progress bars are now displayed
  when using -J with a command\n    that moves file contents around.\n  * Fix race
  that could result in an annexed file's symlink not being\n    created, when eg,
  running concurrent git-annex adds.\n  * add: Fix error recovery rollback to not
  move the injested file content\n    out of the annex back to the file, because other
  files may point to\n    that same content. Instead, copy the injected file content
  out to\n    recover.\n  * quvi may output utf-8 encoded data when the conifigured
  locale doesn't\n    support that; avoid crashing on such invalid encoding.\n  *
  runshell: Avoid failing when $HOME/.ssh does not exist and cannot be\n    created.\n

  \ * fsck: When fscking a dead repo, avoid incorrect \"fixing location log\"\n    message,
  and display a warning about it being dead, since it's unusual\n    to have access
  to a dead repo.\n  * assistant: Pass ssh-options through 3 more git pull/push calls\n

  -0400\n\ngit-annex (5.20151019) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Fix a longstanding,
  but unlikely to occur bug, where dropping\n    a file from a remote could race with
  other drops of the same file,\n    and result in all copies of its content being
  lost.\n  * git-annex-shell: Added lockcontent command, to prevent dropping of\n
  \   a key's content. This is necessary due to the above bugfix.\n  * In some cases,
  the above bugfix changes what git-annex allows you to\n    drop:\n    - When a file
  is present in several special remotes,\n      but not in any accessible git repositories,
  dropping it from one of\n      the special remotes will now fail. Instead, the file
  has to be\n      moved from one of the special remotes to the git repository, and
  can\n      then safely be dropped from the git repository.\n    - If a git remote
  has too old a version of git-annex-shell installed,\n      git-annex won't trust
  it to hold onto a copy of a file when dropping\n      that file from the local git
  repository.\n  * Changed drop ordering when using git annex sync --content or the\n
  \   assistant, to drop from remotes first and from the local repo last.\n    This
  works better with the behavior changes to drop in many cases.\n  * Do verification
  of checksums of annex objects downloaded from remotes.\n  * When annex objects are
  received into git repositories from other git\n    repos, their checksums are verified
  then too.\n  * To get the old, faster, behavior of not verifying checksums, set\n
  \   annex.verify=false, or remote.<name>.annex-verify=false.\n  * setkey, rekey:
  These commands also now verify that the provided file\n    matches the expected
  checksum of the key, unless annex.verify=false.\n  * reinject: Already verified
  content; this can now be disabled by\n    setting annex.verify=false.\n  * sync,
  merge, assistant: When git merge failed for a reason other\n    than a conflicted
  merge, such as a crippled filesystem not allowing\n    particular characters in
  filenames, git-annex would make a merge commit\n    that could omit such files or
  otherwise be bad. Fixed by aborting the\n    whole merge process when git merge
  fails for any reason other than a\n    merge conflict.\n  * Allow building with
  S3 disabled again.\n  * Ported disk free space checking code to work on Solaris.\n
  \ * Windows webapp: Fix support for entering password when setting\n    up a ssh
  remote.\n  * copy --auto was checking the wrong repo's preferred content.\n    (--from
  was checking what --to should, and vice-versa.)\n    Fixed this bug, which was introduced
  in version 5.20150727.\n  * Avoid unnecessary write to the location log when a file
  is unlocked\n    and then added back with unchanged content.\n  * S3: Fix support
  for using https.\n  * Avoid displaying network transport warning when a ssh remote\n
  \   does not yet have an annex.uuid set.\n  * Debian: Add torrent library to build-depends
  as it's packaged now,\n    and stop recommending bittornado | bittorrent.\n  * Debian:
  Remove build dependency on transformers library, as it is now\n    included in ghc.\n

  says there can be only one.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Mon, 19 Oct 2015 13:59:01

  display of\n    problematically encoded filenames on stderr when using --incremental.\n
  \ * When gpg.program is configured, it's used to get the command to run\n    for

  of the gpg command.\n  * Windows: Switched to using git for Windows, rather than
  msysgit.\n    Using msysgit with git-annex is no longer supported.\n  * Windows:
  Even when the user neglects to tell the git installer to\n    add git to PATH, git-annex
  will still work from within the git bash\n    shell, and the webapp can be used
  too.\n  * sync: Add --no-commit, --no-pull, --no-push options to turn off parts
  of\n    the sync process, as well as supporting --commit, --pull, --push, and\n
  \   --no-content options to specify the (current) default behavior.\n  * annex.hardlink

  Fix setting/setting/viewing metadata that contains unicode or other\n    special
  characters, when in a non-unicode locale.\n  * Simplify setup process for a ssh
  remote. Now it suffices to run git\n    remote add, followed by git-annex sync.
  Now the remote is automatically\n    initialized for use by git-annex, where before
  the git-annex branch had\n    to manually be pushed before using git-annex sync.
  Note that this\n    involved changes to git-annex-shell, so if the remote is using
  an old\n    version, the manual push is still needed.\n  * git-annex-shell: Don't
  let configlist auto-init repository when in\n    readonly mode.\n  * Perform a clean
  shutdown when --time-limit is reached.\n    This includes running queued git commands,
  and cleanup actions normally\n    run when a command is finished.\n  * fsck: Commit
  incremental fsck database when --time-limit is reached.\n    Previously, some of

  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Fix bug that prevented uploads to remotes using
  new-style chunking\n    from resuming after the last successfully uploaded chunk.\n
  \ * Switched option parsing to use optparse-applicative. This was a very large\n
  \   and invasive change, and may have caused some minor behavior changes to\n    edge
  cases of option parsing. (For example, the metadata command no\n    longer accepts
  the combination of --get and --set, which never actually\n    worked.)\n  * Bash
  completion file is now included in the git-annex source tree, \n    and installed
  into Debian package (and any other packages built using make\n    install). This
  bash completion is generated by the option parser, so it\n    covers all commands,
  all options, and will never go out of date!\n  * As well as tab completing \"git-annex\"

  url has changed,\n    and avoid adding redundant files. Where before this only looked
  at\n    permalinks in rss feeds, it now also looks at guids.\n  * importfeed: Look
  at not only permalinks, but now also guids\n    to identify previously downloaded

  \ * Adjust debian build deps: The webapp can now build on arm64, s390x\n    and
  hurd-i386. WebDAV support is also available on those architectures.\n  * Debian

  when a git-annex command is told to operate\n    on a file that doesn't exist. It
  will now continue to other\n    files specified after that on the command line,
  and only error out at\n    the end.\n  * S3: Enable debug logging when annex.debug
  or --debug is set.\n  * S3: git annex info will show additional information about
  a S3 remote\n    (endpoint, port, storage class)\n  * S3: Let git annex enableremote
  be used, without trying to recreate\n    a bucket that should already exist.\n  *
  S3: Fix incompatibility with bucket names used by hS3; the aws library\n    cannot
  handle upper-case bucket names. git-annex now converts them to\n    lower case automatically.\n
  \ * import: Check for gitignored files before moving them into the tree.\n    (Needs
  git 1.8.4 or newer.)\n  * import: Don't stop entire import when one file fails due
  to being\n    gitignored or conflicting with something in the work tree.\n  * import:
  Before removing a duplicate file in --deduplicate or\n    --clean-duplicates mode,
  verify that enough copies of its content still\n    exist.\n  * Improve integration
  with KDE's file manager to work with dolphin\n    version 14.12.3 while still being
  compatable with 4.14.2.\n    Thanks, silvio.\n  * assistant: Added --autostop to
  complement --autostart.\n  * Work around wget bug #784348 which could cause it to
  clobber git-annex\n    symlinks when downloading from ftp.\n  * Support checking
  ftp urls for file presence.\n  * Fix bogus failure of fsck --fast.\n  * fsck: Ignore
  error recording the fsck in the activity log,\n    which can happen when running
  fsck in a read-only repository.\n    Closes: #698559\n    (fsck can still need to
  write to the repository if it find problems,\n    but a successful fsck can be done

  known\n    filename extension. This is currently the case when using quvi with\n
  \   youtube. In this case, the extension \".m\" will be used.\n  * Dropped support

  some other arch specific build dependencies that are now\n    available on more
  architectures in Devian unstable.\n  * Windows: Remove cygwin ssh, the newer version
  of which has stopped\n    honoring the setting of HOME. Instead, copy msysgit's
  ssh into PATH.\n    Note that setting up a remote ssh server using password authentication\n
  \   is known to be broken in this release on Windows.\n  * Windows: Roll back to

  directory special remote.\n    This was a reversion caused by the relative path
  changes in 5.20150113.\n  * fsck --from remote: When bad content is found in the
  remote,\n    and the local repo does not have a copy of the content, preserve\n
  \   the bad content in .git/annex/bad/ to avoid further data loss.\n  * fsck --from

  a\n    git-annex-standalone.deb that should work on many old Debian etc\n    systems.
  Thanks, Yaroslav Halchenko.\n  * Windows: Renamed start menu file to avoid loop
  in some versions\n    of Windows where the menu file is treated as a git-annex program.\n

  Always store itemid in metadata; before this was only\n    done when annex.genmetadata
  was set.\n  * Relax debian package dependencies to git >= 1:1.8.1 rather\n    than
  needing >= 1:2.0.\n  * test: Fix --list-tests\n  * addurl --file: When used with
  a special remote that claims\n    urls and checks their contents, don't override
  the user's provided\n    filename with filenames that the special remote suggests.
  Also,\n    don't allow adding the url if the special remote says it contains\n    multiple

  records, instead\n    of abusing the sticky bit. Existing sticky bits are ignored;\n
  \   incremental fscks started by old versions won't be resumed by\n    this version.\n
  \ * fsck: Multiple incremental fscks of different repos (including remotes)\n    can
  now be running at the same time in the same repo without it\n    getting confused
  about which files have been checked for which remotes.\n  * unannex: Refuse to unannex

  changes in the index\n    (if there is anything to unannex), and the unannex code
  path\n    needs to run with a clean index.\n  * Linux standalone: Set LOCPATH=/dev/null
  to work around\n    https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/7695\n    This prevents
  localization from working, but git-annex\n    is not localized anyway.\n  * sync:
  As well as the synced/git-annex push, attempt a\n    git-annex:git-annex push, as
  long as the remote branch\n    is an ancestor of the local branch, to better support
  bare git repos.\n    (This used to be done, but it forgot to do it since version

  in the git repo were *not* encrypted.\n    git-annex enableremote will warn when

  list gpg secret keys, for gcrypt\n    which is not yet supported on Windows.\n  *
  WebDav: Fix enableremote crash when the remote already exists.\n    (Bug introduced

  \ * New annex.hardlink setting. Closes: #758593\n  * init: Automatically detect
  when a repository was cloned with --shared,\n    and set annex.hardlink=true, as
  well as marking the repository as\n    untrusted.\n  * Fix parsing of ipv6 address
  in git remote address when it was not\n    formatted as an url.\n  * The annex-rsync-transport
  configuration is now also used when checking\n    if a key is present on a rsync
  remote, and when dropping a key from\n    the remote.\n  * Promote file not found
  warning message to an error.\n  * Fix transfer lock file FD leak that could occur
  when two separate\n    git-annex processes were both working to perform the same
  set of\n    transfers.\n  * sync: Ensure that pending changes to git-annex branch
  are committed\n    before push when in direct mode. (Fixing a very minor reversion.)\n
  \ * WORM backend: Switched to include the relative path to the file inside\n    the
  repository, rather than just the file's base name. Note that if you're\n    relying
  on such things to keep files separate with WORM, you should really\n    be using
  a better backend.\n  * Rather than crashing when there's a problem with the requested
  bloomfilter\n    capacity/accuracy, fall back to a reasonable default bloom filter
  size.\n  * Fix build with optparse-applicative 0.10. Closes: #761484\n  * webapp:
  Fixed visual glitch in xmpp pairing that was reported live by a\n    user who tracked
  me down in front of a coffee cart in Portland. \n    (New bug reporting method of

  all external\n    and hook special remotes.\n  * Partially transferred files are
  automatically resumed when using\n    chunked remotes!\n  * The old chunksize= option
  is deprecated. Do not use for new remotes.\n  * Legacy code for directory remotes
  using the old chunksize= option\n    will keep them working, but more slowly than
  before.\n  * webapp: Automatically install Konqueror integration scripts\n    to
  get and drop files.\n  * repair: Removing bad objects could leave fsck finding no
  more\n    unreachable objects, but some branches no longer accessible.\n    Fix
  this, including support for fixing up repositories that\n    were incompletely repaired
  before.\n  * Fix cost calculation for non-encrypted remotes.\n  * Display exception
  message when a transfer fails due to an exception.\n  * WebDAV: Sped up by avoiding
  making multiple http connections\n    when storing a file.\n  * WebDAV: Avoid buffering
  whole file in memory when uploading and\n    downloading.\n  * WebDAV: Dropped support
  for DAV before 1.0.\n  * testremote: New command to test uploads/downloads to a
  remote.\n  * Dropping an object from a bup special remote now deletes the git branch\n
  \   for the object, although of course the object's content cannot be deleted\n
  \   due to the nature of bup.\n  * unlock: Better error handling; continue past
  files that are not available\n    or cannot be unlocked due to disk space, and try
  all specified files.\n  * Windows: Now uses actual inode equivilants in new direct
  mode\n    repositories, for safer detection of eg, renaming of files with the same\n
  \   size and mtime.\n  * direct: Fix ugly warning messages.\n  * WORM backend: When
  adding a file in a subdirectory, avoid including the\n    subdirectory in the key
  name.\n  * S3, Glacier, WebDAV: Fix bug that prevented accessing the creds\n    when
  the repository was configured with encryption=shared embedcreds=yes.\n  * direct:
  Avoid leaving file content in misctemp if interrupted.\n  * git-annex-shell sendkey:
  Don't fail if a remote asks for a key to be sent\n    that already has a transfer
  lock file indicating it's being sent to that\n    remote. The remote may have moved

  re-checksumming when migrating from hashE to hash backend.\n  * uninit: Avoid failing
  final removal in some direct mode repositories\n    due to file modes.\n  * S3:
  Deal with AWS ACL configurations that do not allow creating or\n    checking the
  location of a bucket, but only reading and writing content to\n    it.\n  * resolvemerge:
  New plumbing command that runs the automatic merge conflict\n    resolver.\n  *
  Deal with change in git 2.0 that made indirect mode merge conflict\n    resolution
  leave behind old files.\n  * sync: Fix git sync with local git remotes even when
  they don't have an\n    annex.uuid set. (The assistant already did so.)\n  * Set
  gcrypt-publish-participants when setting up a gcrypt repository,\n    to avoid unnecessary
  passphrase prompts.\n    This is a security/usability tradeoff. To avoid exposing
  the gpg key\n    ids who can decrypt the repository, users can unset\n    gcrypt-publish-participants.\n
  \ * Install nautilus hooks even when ~/.local/share/nautilus/ does not yet\n    exist,

  \ * Fix build with wai 0.3.0.\n  * Deal with FAT's low resolution timestamps, which
  in combination with\n    Linux's caching of higher res timestamps while a FAT is

  available.\n  * webapp: More robust startup when annex directory is not a git repo.\n
  \ * initremote/enableremote: Basic support for using with regular git remotes;\n
  \   initremote stores the location of an already existing git remote,\n    and enableremote
  setups up a remote using its stored location.\n  * webapp: Support for enabling
  known git repositories on ssh servers.\n    The repository must have been added
  using initremote.\n  * webapp: When setting up a ssh remote, record it using initremote,\n

  \ * info: Allow use in a repository where annex.uuid is not set.\n  * reinit: New
  command that can initialize a new repository using\n    the configuration of a previously
  known repository.\n    Useful if a repository got deleted and you want\n    to clone
  it back the way it was.\n  * drop --from: When local repository is untrusted, its
  copy of a file does\n    not count.\n  * Bring back rsync -p, but only when git-annex
  is running on a non-crippled\n    file system. This is a better approach to fix
  #700282 while not\n    unncessarily losing file permissions on non-crippled systems.\n
  \ * webapp: Start even if the current directory is listed in\n    ~/.config/git-annex/autostart

  \ * When init detects that git is not configured to commit, and sets\n    user.email
  to work around the problem, also make it set user.name.\n  * webapp: Support using
  git-annex on a remote server, which was installed\n    from the standalone tarball
  or OSX app, and so does not have\n    git-annex in PATH (and may also not have git

  options like --copies and --in\n    (but not --include and --exclude).\n  * numcopies:
  New command, sets global numcopies value that is seen by all\n    clones of a repository.\n
  \ * The annex.numcopies git config setting is deprecated. Once the numcopies\n    command
  is used to set the global number of copies, any annex.numcopies\n    git configs

  indirect: Refuse to do anything when the assistant\n    or git-annex watch daemon

  \ * fsck --from: Fscking a remote is now supported. It's done by retrieving\n    the
  contents of the specified files from the remote, and checking them,\n    so can
  be an expensive operation. Still, if the remote is a special\n    remote, or a git
  repository that you cannot run fsck in locally, it's\n    nice to have the ability
  to fsck it.\n  * If you have any directory special remotes, now would be a good
  time to\n    fsck them, in case you were hit by the data loss bug fixed in the\n

  caching is now enabled automatically by git-annex.\n    Only one ssh connection
  is made to each host per git-annex run, which\n    can speed some things up a lot,

  also share ssh connections.\n    Cached ssh connections are shut down when git-annex
  exits.\n  * To disable the ssh caching (if for example you have your own broader\n
