synopsis: manage files with git, without checking their contents into git
changelog: "git-annex (7.20190507) upstream; urgency=medium\n\n  * Fix reversion in
  last release that caused wrong tree to be written\n    to remote tracking branch
  after an export of a subtree.\n  * Improved locking when multiple git-annex processes
  are writing to \n    the .git/index file\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Tue,
  07 May 2019 13:05:33 -0400\n\ngit-annex (7.20190503) upstream; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * adb special remote supports being configured with importtree=yes,\n    to allow
  git-annex import of files from an Android device. This can be\n    combined with
  exporttree=yes and git-annex export used to send changes\n    back to the Android
  device.\n  * S3 special remote supports being configured with importtree=yes,\n
  \   to allow git-annex import of files from a S3 bucket. This can be\n    combined
  with exporttree=yes and git-annex export used to send changes\n    back to the S3
  bucket.\n  * S3: When versioning is enabled on a bucket, importing from it will\n
  \   import old versions of files that were written to the bucket as well\n    as
  the current versions. A git history is synthesized to reflect the way\n    the bucket
  changed over time.\n  * Fix bug that caused importing from a special remote to repeatedly\n
  \   download unchanged files when multiple files in the remote have the same\n    content.\n
  \ * Made git-annex sync --content much faster when all the remotes it's\n    syncing
  with are export/import remotes.\n  * sync: When listing contents on an import remote
  fails, proceed with\n    other syncing instead of aborting.\n  * renameremote: New
  command, changes the name that is used to enable \n    a special remote. Especially
  useful when you want to reuse the name\n    of an old remote for something new.\n
  \ * Drop support for building with aws older than 0.14.\n  * info: Show when a remote
  is configured with importtree.\n  * Added mimeencoding= term to annex.largefiles
  expressions.\n    This is probably mostly useful to match non-text files with eg\n
  \   \"mimeencoding=binary\"\n  * git-annex matchexpression: Added --mimeencoding
  option.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Fri, 03 May 2019 12:47:41 -0400\n\ngit-annex
  (7.20190322) upstream; urgency=medium\n\n  * New feature allows importing from special
  remotes, using\n    git annex import branch:subdir --from remote\n  * Directory
  special remote supports being configured with importree=yes,\n    to allow git-annex
  import of files from the directory. This can be\n    combined with exporttree=yes
  and git-annex export used to send changes\n    back to the same directory.\n  *
  Remote tracking branches are updated when importing and exporting to\n    special
  remotes, in ways analagous to how git fetch and git push do.\n  * export: Deprecated
  the --tracking option.\n    Instead, users can configure remote.<name>.annex-tracking-branch\n
  \   themselves.\n  * sync --content: When remote.<name>.annex-tracking-branch is
  configured,\n    import from special remotes.\n  * sync, assistant: --no-push and
  remote.<name>.annex-push prevent exporting\n    trees to special remotes.\n  * Fix
  storage of metadata values containing newlines.\n    (Reversion introduced in version
  7.20190122.)\n  * Sped up git-annex export in repositories with lots of keys.\n
  \ * S3: Support enabling bucket versioning when built with aws-0.21.1.\n  * stack.yaml:
  Build with aws-0.21.1\n  * Fix cleanup of git-annex:export.log after git-annex forget
  --drop-dead.\n  * Makefile: Added install-home target which installs git-annex into\n
  \   the HOME directory.\n  * addurl --file: Fix a bug that made youtube-dl be used
  unneccessarily\n    when adding an html url that does not contain any media.\n  *
  Add -- before %f in the smudge/clean filter configuration,\n    to support filenames
  starting with dashes.\n    (To update the config of existing repositories, you can\n
  \   re-run git-annex init.)\n  * fsck: Detect situations where annex.thin has caused
  data loss\n    to the content of locked files.\n  * Removed bundled gpg from the
  Linux standalone build and OSX dmg,\n    because gpg now always wants to use gpg-agent,
  and shipping such a daemon\n    in those is not a good idea.\n  * import: Let --force
  overwrite symlinks, not only regular files.\n  * Android: Fix typo of name of armv7l
  in installation script.\n    Thanks, 4omecha.\n  * S3: Added protocol= initremote
  setting, to allow https to be used\n    on a non-standard port.\n\n -- Joey Hess

  urgency=medium\n\n  * init: Fix bug when direct mode needs to be enabled on a crippled\n
  \   filesystem, that left the repository in indirect mode.\n  * Fix false positive
  in export conflict detection, that occurred\n    when the same tree was exported
  by multiple clones. Previous fix was\n    incomplete.\n  * When key-based retrieval
  from a S3 remote with exporttree=yes appendonly=yes\n    fails, fall back to trying
  to retrieve from the exported tree.\n    This allows downloads of files that were
  exported to such a remote\n    before versioning was enabled on it.\n  * Fix path
  separator bug on Windows that completely broke git-annex\n    since version 7.20190122.\n
  \ * Improved speed of S3 remote by only loading S3 creds once.\n  * Display progress
  bar when getting files from export remotes.\n  * Fix race in cleanup of othertmp
  directory that could result in a failure\n    attempting to access it.\n  * fromkey:
  Made idempotent.\n  * fromkey: Added --json.\n  * fromkey --batch output changed
  to support using it with --json.\n    The old output was not parseable for any useful
  information, so\n    this is not expected to break anything.\n  * Avoid performing
  repository fixups for submodules and git-worktrees\n    when there's a .noannex
  file that will prevent git-annex from being\n    used in the repository.\n  * init:
  Don't let --force be used to override a .noannex file,\n    instead the user can
  just delete the file.\n  * webdav: Exporting files with '#' or '?' in their name
  won't work because\n    urls get truncated on those. Fail in a better way in this
  case,\n    and avoid failing when removing such files from the export, so\n    after
  the user has renamed the problem files the export will succeed.\n  * On Windows,
  avoid using rsync for local copies, since rsync is not\n    always available there.\n
  \ * Added NetworkBSD build flag to deal with Network.BSD moving to a new\n    package.\n\n

  upstream; urgency=medium\n\n  * initremote S3: When configured with versioning=yes,
  either ask the user\n    to enable bucket versioning, or auto-enable it when built
  with aws-0.22.\n  * enableremote S3: Do not let versioning=yes be set on existing
  remote,\n    because when git-annex lacks S3 version IDs for files stored in\n    the
  bucket, deleting them would cause data loss.\n  * S3: Detect when version=yes but
  an exported file lacks a S3 version ID,\n    and refuse to delete it, to avoid data
  loss.\n  * S3: Send a Content-Type header when storing objects in S3,\n    so exports
  to public buckets can be linked to from web pages.\n    (When git-annex is built
  with MagicMime support.)\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Tue, 29 Jan 2019 15:09:20
  -0400\n\ngit-annex (7.20190122) upstream; urgency=medium\n\n  * sync --content:
  Fix dropping unwanted content from the local repository.\n  * sync --content: Support
  dropping local content that has reached an\n    exporttree remote that is not untrusted
  (currently only S3 remotes\n    with versioning).\n  * init: When --version=5 is
  passed on a crippled filesystem,\n    use a v5 direct mode repo as requested, rather
  than upgrading to v7\n    adjusted unlocked. (Fixes test suite on crippled filesystems.)\n
  \ * Some optimisations, including a 10x faster timestamp parser,\n    a 7x faster
  key parser, and improved parsing and serialization of\n    git-annex branch data.
  Many commands will run 5-15% faster.\n  * Stricter parser for keys doesn't allow
  doubled fields or out of order fields.\n  * The benchmark command, which only had
  some old benchmarking of the sqlite\n    databases before, now allows benchmarking
  any other git-annex commands.\n  * Support being built with ghc 8.6.3 (MonadFail).\n
  \ * Removed old code that cleaned up after a bug in git-annex versions\n    3.20111105-3.20111110.
  In the unlikely event that a repo was\n    last touched by that ancient git-annex
  version, the descriptions\n    of remotes would appear missing when used with this
  version of\n    git-annex.\n  * Improve uuid.log parser to preserve whitespace in
  repo descriptions.\n  * Improve activity.log parser to not remove unknown values,\n
  \   allowing for future expansion.\n  * addunused, merge, assistant: Avoid creating
  work tree files in\n    subdirectories in an edge case where the key contains \"/\".\n
  \ * testremote: Support testing readonly remotes with the --test-readonly option.\n
  \ * Switch to using .git/annex/othertmp for tmp files other than partial\n    downloads,
  and make stale files left in that directory when git-annex\n    is interrupted be
  cleaned up promptly by subsequent git-annex processes.\n  * The .git/annex/misctmp
  directory is no longer used and git-annex will\n    delete anything lingering in
  there after it's 1 week old.\n  * Estimated time to completion display shortened
  from eg \"1h1m1s\" to \"1h1m\".\n  * Fix doubled progress display when downloading
  an url when -J is used.\n  * unused: Update suggested git log message to see where
  data was previously\n    used so it will also work with v7 unlocked pointer files.\n
  \ * importfeed: Better error message when downloading the feed fails.\n  * Make
  test suite work better when the temp directory is on NFS.\n  * webapp: Remove configurator
  for box.com repository, since their\n    webdav support is going away at the end
  of this January.\n  * webapp: Remove configurator for gitlab, which stopped supporting
  git-annex\n    some time ago.\n  * Android: For armv71 architecture, use the armel
  build.\n  * Windows: If 64 bit git is installed, use it when installing git-annex.\n
  \   (However, rsync still won't work and this is still not the documented way\n
  \   to install it.)\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Tue, 22 Jan 2019 12:25:26
  -0400\n\ngit-annex (7.20181211) upstream; urgency=medium\n\n  * S3: Improve diagnostics
  when a remote is configured with exporttree and\n    versioning, but no S3 version
  id has been recorded for a key.\n  * findref: Support file matching options: --include,
  --exclude,\n    --want-get, --want-drop, --largerthan, --smallerthan, --accessedwithin\n
  \ * Commands supporting --branch now apply file matching options --include,\n    --exclude,
  --want-get, --want-drop to filenames from the branch.\n    Previously, combining
  --branch with those would fail to match anything.\n  * add, import, findref: Support
  --time-limit.\n  * Add --branch option to git-annex find and mildly deprecate findref
  in\n    favor of it.\n  * webdav: When initializing, avoid trying to make a directory
  at the top of\n    the webdav server, which could never accomplish anything and
  failed on\n    nextcloud servers. (Reversion introduced in version 6.20170925.)\n
  \ * Fix a case where upgrade to v7 caused git to think that unlocked files\n    were
  modified.\n  * Fix bug upgrading from direct mode to v7: when files in the repository\n
  \   were already committed as v7 unlocked files elsewhere, and the\n    content
  was present in the direct mode repository, the annexed files\n    got their full
  content checked into git.\n  * Fix bug that caused v7 unlocked files in a direct
  mode repository\n    to get locked when committing.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>
  \ Tue, 11 Dec 2018 16:33:10 -0400\n\ngit-annex (7.20181205) upstream; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * Make bittorrent special remote work w/o btshowmetainfo installed\n    when it
  was build with torrentparser.\n    Thanks, Robert Schütz\n  * When running youtube-dl
  to get a filename, pass --no-playlist.\n  * Fix build without concurrent-output.\n
  \ * init: When a crippled filesystem causes an adjusted unlocked branch to\n    be
  used, set repo version to 7, which it neglected to do before.\n  * init: When on
  a crippled filesystem, and the git version is too old\n    to use an adjusted unlocked
  branch, fall back to using direct mode.\n  * info: When used with an exporttree
  remote, includes an \"exportedtree\"\n    info, which is the tree last exported
  to the remote. During an export\n    conflict, multiple values will be listed.\n
  \ * dropunused: When an unused object file has gotten modified, eg due to\n    annex.thin
  being set, don't silently skip it, but display a warning\n    and let --force drop
  it.\n  * annex.cachecreds: New config to allow disabling of credentials caching\n
  \   for special remotes.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Wed, 05 Dec 2018 14:02:27
  -0400\n\ngit-annex (7.20181121) upstream; urgency=medium\n\n  * git-annex-shell:
  Fix hang when transferring the same objects to two\n    different clients at the
  same time. (Or when annex.pidlock is used,\n    two different objects.)\n  * Fixed
  some other potential hangs in the P2P protocol.\n  * Fix bash completion of \"git
  annex\" to propertly handle files with\n    spaces and other problem characters.
  (Completion of \"git-annex\"\n    already did.)\n  * Fix resume of download of url
  when the whole file content is\n    already actually downloaded.\n  * When an export
  conflict prevents accessing a special remote,\n    be clearer about what the problem
  is and how to resolve it.\n  * export, sync --content: Avoid unnecessarily trying
  to upload files\n    to an exporttree remote that already contains the files.\n
  \ * smudge: When passed a file located outside the working tree, eg by git\n    diff,
  avoid erroring out.\n  * drop -J: Avoid processing the same key twice at the same
  time when\n    multiple annexed files use it.\n  * When a command is operating on
  multiple files and there's an error\n    with one, try harder to continue to the
  rest. (As was already done\n    for many types of errors including IO errors.)\n
  \ * Fixed a crash when using -J with ssh password prompts in\n    --quiet/--json
  mode.\n    Thanks to Yaroslav Halchenko and the DataLad&ReproNim team for\n    helping
  to track down this bug.\n  * Remove esqueleto dependency to allow upgrading other
  dependencies to\n    newer versions.\n    Thanks Sean Parsons.\n  * Fix build with
  persistent-sqlite older than 2.6.3.\n  * Updated stack.yaml to lts-12.19; added
  stack-lts-9.9.yaml\n    to support old versions of stack.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>
  \ Wed, 21 Nov 2018 14:22:47 -0400\n\ngit-annex (7.20181105) upstream; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * Fix test suite failure when git-annex test is not run inside a git\n    repository.\n
  \ * Fix a P2P protocol hang.\n  * importfeed: Avoid erroring out when a feed has
  been repeatedly broken,\n    as that can leave other imported files not checked
  into git.\n  * Increase minimum QuickCheck version.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>
  \ Mon, 05 Nov 2018 13:31:09 -0400\n\ngit-annex (7.20181031) upstream; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * Added v7 repository mode. v6 upgrades automatically to v7, but\n    v5 is still
  the default for now. While v6 was always experimental\n    to some degree, its successor
  v7 is ready for production use!\n    http://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/unlocked_files/\n
  \ * Direct mode repositories are deprecated; they have many problems\n    that v7
  fixes, so upgrading them now is recommended (but not yet\n    required): git annex
  upgrade --version=7\n  * init: When in a crippled filesystem, initialize a v7 repository\n
  \   using an adjusted unlocked branch, instead of a direct mode repository.\n  *
  At long last there's a way to hide annexed files whose content\n    is missing from
  the working tree: git-annex adjust --hide-missing\n    See https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/hiding_missing_files/\n
  \ * When already in an adjusted branch, running git-annex adjust\n    again will
  update the branch as needed. This is mostly\n    useful with --hide-missing to hide/unhide
  files after their content\n    has been dropped or received.\n  * git-annex sync
  --content supports --hide-missing; it can\n    be used to get the content of hidden
  files, and it updates the\n    adjusted branch to hide/unhide files as necessary.\n
  \ * smudge: The smudge filter no longer provides git with annexed\n    file content,
  to avoid a git memory leak, and because that did not\n    honor annex.thin. Now
  git annex smudge --update has to be run\n    after a checkout to update unlocked
  files in the working tree \n    with annexed file contents.\n  * v7 init, upgrade:
  Install git post-checkout and post-merge hooks that run \n    git annex smudge --update.\n
  \ * precommit: Run git annex smudge --update, because the post-merge\n    hook is
  not run when there is a merge conflict. So the work tree will\n    be updated when
  a commit is made to resolve the merge conflict.\n  * Note that git has no hooks
  run after git stash or git cherry-pick,\n    so the user will have to manually run
  git annex smudge --update\n    after such commands.\n  * Removed the old Android
  app.\n  * Removed support for building with very old ghc < 8.0.1,\n    and with
  yesod < 1.4.3, and without concurrent-output,\n    which were only being used for
  the Android cross build.\n  * Webapp: Fix termux detection.\n  * runshell: Use system
  locales when built with \n    GIT_ANNEX_PACKAGE_INSTALL set. (For Neurodebian packages.)\n
  \ * Fix database inconsistency that could cause git-annex to\n    get confused about
  whether a locked file's content was present.\n  * Fix concurrency bug that occurred
  on the first download from an\n    exporttree remote.\n  * init --version=6 will
  still work, but the repository is auto-upgraded\n    immediately to v7.\n  * When
  annex.thin is set, allow hard links to be made between executable\n    work tree
  files and annex objects.\n  * addurl: Removed undocumented special case in handling
  of a CHECKURL-MULTI\n    response with only a single file listed. Rather than ignoring
  the url that\n    was in the response, use it.\n  * webapp: Fixed a crash when adding
  a git remote.\n    (Reversion introduced in version 6.20180112)\n  * migrate: Fix
  failure to migrate from URL keys.\n    (Reversion introduced in version 6.20180926)\n
  \ * Cache high-resolution mtimes for improved detection of modified files\n    in
  v7 (and direct mode).\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Wed, 31 Oct 2018 09:21:50

  a remote's export is not updated to the current\n    tree because export tracking
  is not configured.\n  * Improve display when git config download from a http remote
  fails.\n  * Added annex.jobs setting, which is like using the -J option.\n  * Fix
  reversion in support of annex.web-options.\n  * rmurl: Fix a case where removing
  the last url left git-annex thinking\n    content was still present in the web special
  remote.\n  * SETURLPRESENT, SETURIPRESENT, SETURLMISSING, and SETURIMISSING\n    used
  to update the presence information of the external special remote\n    that called
  them; this was not documented behavior and is no longer done.\n  * export: Fix false
  positive in export conflict detection, that occurred\n    when the same tree was
  exported by multiple clones.\n  * Fix potential crash in exporttree database due
  to failure to honor\n    uniqueness constraint.\n  * Fix crash when exporttree is
  set to a bad value.\n  * Linux standalone: Avoid using bundled cp before envionment
  is fully set up.\n  * Added arm64 Linux standalone build.\n  * Improved termux installation

  in the last release that broke interoperation with\n    older versions of git-annex-shell.\n
  \ * init: Improve generated post-receive hook, so it won't fail when\n    run on
  a system whose git-annex is too old to support git-annex post-receive\n  * init:
  Update the post-receive hook when re-run in an existing repository.\n  * S3: Fix
  url construction bug when the publicurl has been set to an url\n    that does not

  do when \n    git-annex used wget and curl.\n  * Fix support for filenames containing
  newlines when querying git\n    cat-file, though less efficiently than other filenames.\n
  \   This should make git-annex fully support filenames containing newlines\n    as
  the rest of git's interface is used in newline-safe ways.\n  * Added -z option to
  git-annex commands that use --batch, useful for\n    supporting filenames containing
  newlines.\n  * Added annex.maxextensionlength for use cases where extensions longer\n
  \   than 4 characters are needed.\n  * Added remote.name.annex-security-allow-unverified-downloads,
  a\n    per-remote setting for annex.security.allow-unverified-downloads.\n  * More

  upstream; urgency=medium\n\n  * When --batch is used with matching options like
  --in, --metadata,\n    etc, only operate on the provided files when they match those
  options.\n    Otherwise, a blank line is output in the batch protocol.\n    Affected
  commands: find, add, whereis, drop, copy, move, get\n  * Make metadata --batch combined
  with matching options refuse to run,\n    since it does not seem worth supporting
  that combination.\n  * v6 add: Take advantage of improved SIGPIPE handler in git
  2.5 to\n    speed up the clean filter by not reading the file content from the\n
  \   pipe. This also avoids git buffering the whole file content in memory.\n  *
  v6: After updating the worktree for an add/drop, update git's index,\n    so git
  status will not show the files as modified.\n  * v6: When annex.largefiles is not
  configured for a file, running git\n    add or git commit, or otherwise using git
  to stage a file\n    will add it to the annex if the file was in the annex before,\n
  \   and to git otherwise. This is to avoid accidental conversion.\n    Note that
  git-annex add's behavior has not changed.\n  * v6: Update associated files database
  when git has staged changes\n    to pointer files.\n  * v6: Fix some race conditions.\n
  \ * v6: Fix annex object file permissions when git-annex add is run\n    on a modified
  unlocked file, and in some related cases.\n  * v6: When a file is unlocked but has
  not been modified,\n    and the unlocking is only staged, git-annex add did not
  lock it.\n    Now it will, for consistency with how modified files are handled and\n
  \   with v5.\n  * Fix git command queue to be concurrency safe.\n  * linux standalone:
  When LOCPATH is already set, use it instead of the\n    bundled locales. It can
  be set to an empty string to use the system\n    locales too.\n  * Stop using external
  hash programs, since cryptonite is faster.\n  * Fix build on FreeBSD.\n  * S3: Support
  buckets with versioning enabled. When a remote\n    is configured with exporttree=yes
  versioning=yes, git-annex can\n    download past versions of exported files from
  it.\n  * S3: Multipart uploads are now only supported when git-annex is built\n
  \   with aws-0.16.0 or later, as earlier versions of the library don't\n    support
  versioning with multipart uploads.\n  * S3: Support AWS_SESSION_TOKEN.\n  * Don't
  use GIT_PREFIX when GIT_WORK_TREE=. because it seems git\n    does not intend GIT_WORK_TREE
  to be relative to GIT_PREFIX in that\n    case, despite GIT_WORK_TREE=.. being relative
  to GIT_PREFIX.\n  * Don't use GIT_PREFIX to fix up a relative GIT_DIR, because\n
  \   git 2.11 sets GIT_PREFIX to a path it's not relative to.\n    and apparently

  \ * Refuse to download content, that cannot be verified with a hash, \n    from
  encrypted special remotes (for CVE-2018-10859),\n    and from all external special
  remotes and glacier (for CVE-2018-10857).\n    In particular, URL and WORM keys
  stored on such remotes won't\n    be downloaded. If this affects your files, you
  can run\n    `git-annex migrate` on the affected files, to convert them\n    to
  use a hash.\n  * Added annex.security.allow-unverified-downloads, which can override\n
  \   the above.\n  * Added annex.security.allowed-url-schemes setting, which defaults\n
  \   to only allowing http, https, and ftp URLs. Note especially that file:/\n    is
  no longer enabled by default.\n  * Removed annex.web-download-command, since its
  interface does not allow\n    supporting annex.security.allowed-url-schemes across
  redirects.\n    If you used this setting, you may want to instead use annex.web-options\n
  \   to pass options to curl.\n  * git-annex will refuse to download content from
  http servers on\n    localhost, or any private IP addresses, to prevent accidental\n
  \   exposure of internal data. This can be overridden with the\n    annex.security.allowed-http-addresses
  setting.\n  * Local http proxies will not be used unless allowed by the\n    annex.security.allowed-http-addresses
  setting.\n  * Since the interfaces to curl and youtube-dl do not have a way to\n
  \   prevent them from accessing localhost or private IP addresses,\n    they default
  to not being used for url downloads.\n    Only when annex.security.allowed-http-addresses=all
  will curl and\n    youtube-dl be used.\n \n  Non-security fix changes:\n\n  * Fix
  build with ghc 8.4+, which broke due to the Semigroup Monoid change. \n  * version:
  Show operating system and repository version list \n    when run outside a git repo
  too.\n  * Fix annex-checkuuid implementation, so that remotes configured that\n
  \   way can be used.\n  * Fix problems accessing repositories over http when annex.tune.*\n
  \   is configured.\n  * External special remotes can now add info to `git annex
  info $remote`,\n    by replying to the GETINFO message.\n  * adb: Android serial
  numbers are not all 16 characters long, so accept\n    other lengths.\n  * Display
  error messages that come from git-annex-shell when the p2p\n    protocol is used,
  so that diskreserve messages, IO errors, etc from\n    the remote side are visible
  again.\n  * When content has been lost from an export remote and \n    git-annex
  fsck --from remote has noticed it's gone, re-running\n    git-annex export or git-annex
  sync --content will re-upload it.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Fri, 22 Jun

  \ * New protocol for communicating with git-annex-shell increases speed\n    of
  operations involving ssh remotes. When not transferring large files,\n    git-annex
  is between 200% and 400% faster using the new protocol,\n    and it's just as fast
  as before when transferring large files.\n    (When the remote has an old git-annex-shell,
  git-annex falls back\n    to the old slower code. This fallback is planned to be
  removed \n    after 5 years or so.)\n  * Note that, due to not using rsync to transfer
  files over ssh\n    any longer, permissions and other file metadata of annexed files\n
  \   will no longer be preserved when copying them to and from ssh remotes.\n    Other
  remotes never supported preserving that information, so\n    this is not considered
  a regression.\n  * Fix data loss bug in content locking over tor, when the remote\n
  \   repository is in direct mode, it neglected to check that the content\n    was
  actually present when locking it. This could cause git annex drop\n    to remove
  the only copy of a file when it thought the tor remote had\n    a copy.\n  * Fix
  data loss bug when the local repository uses direct mode, and a\n    locally modified
  file is dropped from a remote repsitory. The bug\n    caused the modified file to
  be counted as a copy of the original file.\n    (This is not a severe bug because
  in such a situation, dropping\n    from the remote and then modifying the file is
  allowed and has the same\n    end result.)\n  * Some downloads will be verified,
  even when annex.verify=false.\n    This is done in some edge cases where there's
  a likelyhood than an\n    object was downloaded incorrectly.\n  * Support exporttree=yes
  for rsync special remotes.\n  * Added backends for the BLAKE2 family of hashes,
  when built with\n    a new enough version of cryptonite.\n  * Improve SHA*E extension
  extraction code to not treat parts of the\n    filename that contain punctuation
  or other non-alphanumeric characters\n    as extensions. Before, such characters
  were filtered out.\n  * Better ssh connection warmup when using -J for concurrency.\n
  \   Avoids ugly messages when forced ssh command is not git-annex-shell.\n  * Fix
  race condition in ssh warmup that caused git-annex to get\n    stuck and never process
  some files when run with high levels of\n    concurrency.\n  * Fix reversion introduced
  in 6.20171214 that caused concurrent\n    transfers to incorrectly fail with \"transfer
  already in progress\".\n  * Note that Remote/Git.hs now contains AGPL licensed code,\n
  \   thus the license of git-annex as a whole is AGPL. This was already\n    the
  case when git-annex was built with the webapp enabled.\n  * Include amount of data
  transferred in progress display.\n  * Dial back optimisation when building on arm,
  which prevents\n    ghc and llc from running out of memory when optimising some
  files.\n    (Unfortunately this fix is incomplete due to a ghc bug.)\n\n -- Joey

  fix: Disallow hostname starting with a dash, which\n    would get passed to ssh

  \ * Added GIT_ANNEX_VECTOR_CLOCK environment variable, which can be used to\n    override
  the default timestamps used in log files in the git-annex\n    branch. This is a
  dangerous environment variable; use with caution.\n  * Fix a git-annex test failure
  when run on NFS due to NFS lock files\n    preventing directory removal.\n  * test:
  Avoid most situations involving failure to delete test\n    directories, by forking
  a worker process and only deleting the test\n    directory once it exits.\n  * Disable
  http-client's default 30 second response timeout when HEADing\n    an url to check
  if it exists. Some web servers take quite a long time\n    to answer a HEAD request.\n
  \ * Added remote configuration settings annex-ignore-command and\n    annex-sync-command,
  which are dynamic equivilants of the annex-ignore\n    and annex-sync configurations.\n
  \ * Prevent spaces from being embedded in the name of new WORM keys,\n    as that
  handing spaces in keys would complicate things like the\n    external special remote
  protocol.\n  * migrate: WORM keys containing spaces will be migrated to not contain\n
  \   spaces anymore.\n  * External special remotes will refuse to operate on keys
  with spaces in\n    their names. That has never worked correctly due to the design
  of the\n    external special remote protocol. Display an error message suggesting\n
  \   migration.\n  * Fix incorrect external special remote documentation, which said
  that\n    the filename parameter to the TRANSFER command could not contain\n    spaces.
  It can in fact contain spaces. Special remotes implementors\n    that relied on
  that may need to fix bugs in their special remotes.\n  * Fix the external special
  remotes git-annex-remote-ipfs, \n    git-annex-remote-torrent and the example.sh

  \ * Cryptographically secure hashes can be forced to be used in a\n    repository,
  by setting annex.securehashesonly.\n    This does not prevent the git repository
  from containing links\n    to insecure hashes, but it does prevent the content of
  such files\n    from being added to .git/annex/objects by any method.\n  * Tighten
  key parser to prevent SHA1 collision attacks generating\n    two keys that have
  the same SHA1. (Only done for keys that contain\n    a hash). This ensures that
  signed git commits of annexed files\n    will remain secure, as long as git-annex
  is using a secure hashing\n    backend.\n  * fsck: Warn about any files whose content
  is present, that don't\n    use secure hashes, when annex.securehashesonly is set.\n
  \ * init: When annex.securehashesonly has been set with git-annex config,\n    copy
  that value to the annex.securehashesonly git config.\n  * Added --securehash option
  to match files using a secure hash function,\n    and corresponding securehash preferred
  content expression.\n  * sync, merge: Fail when the current branch has no commits
  yet, instead\n    of not merging in anything from remotes and appearing to succeed.\n
  \ * Run ssh with -n whenever input is not being piped into it,\n    to avoid it
  consuming stdin that it shouldn't.\n    This fixes git-annex-checkpresentkey --batch
  remote,\n    which didn't output results for all keys passed into it. Other\n    git-annex
  commands that communicate with a remote over ssh may also\n    have been consuming
  stdin that they shouldn't have, which could have\n    impacted using them in eg,
  shell scripts.\n  * sync: Improve integration with receive.denyCurrentBranch=updateInstead,\n
  \   displaying error messages from the remote then it fails to update\n    its checked
  out branch.\n  * Added post-recieve hook, which makes updateInstead work with direct\n
  \   mode and adjusted branches.\n  * init: Set up the post-receive hook.\n  * sync:
  When syncing with a local repository located on a crippled\n    filesystem, run
  the post-receive hook there, since it wouldn't get run\n    otherwise. This makes
  pushing to repos on FAT-formatted removable\n    drives update them when receive.denyCurrentBranch=updateInstead.\n
  \ * config group groupwanted numcopies schedule wanted required: \n    Avoid displaying
  extraneous messages about repository auto-init,\n    git-annex branch merging, etc,
  when being used to get information.\n  * adjust: Fix behavior when used in a repository
  that contains\n    submodules.\n  * Run wget with -nv instead of -q, so it will
  display HTTP errors.\n  * Run curl with -S, so HTTP errors are displayed, even when\n
  \   it's otherwise silent.\n  * When downloading in --json or --quiet mode, use
  curl in preference\n    to wget, since curl is able to display only errors to stderr,
  unlike\n    wget.\n  * status: Pass --ignore-submodules=when option on to git status.\n
  \ * config --set: As well as setting value in git-annex branch,\n    set local gitconfig.
  This is needed especially for\n    annex.securehashesonly, which is read only from
  local gitconfig and not\n    the git-annex branch.\n  * Removed support for building
  with the old cryptohash library.\n    Building with that library made git-annex
  not support SHA3; it's time\n    for that to always be supported in case SHA2 dominoes.\n

  annex.autocommit can be configured via git-annex config, to control\n    the default

  may become the default at\n    some point in the future. As well as being configuable
  by git config,\n    it can be configured by git-annex config to control the default\n
  \   behavior in all clones of a repository.\n  * stack.yaml: Update to lts-7.18.\n
  \ * Some optimisations to string splitting code.\n  * unused: When large files are
  checked right into git, avoid buffering\n    their contents in memory.\n  * unused:
  Improved memory use significantly when there are a lot\n    of differences between

  is that by 2021-12-31, this version of git-annex will be\n    shipped in a Debian
  stable release. If that turns out to not be the\n    case, this change will need
  to be cherry-picked into the git-annex in\n    Debian stable, or its wormhole pairing

  use the specified\n    UUID for the new special remote, instead of generating a
  UUID.\n    This can be useful in some situations, eg when the same data can be\n
  \   accessed via two different special remote backends.\n  * import: Changed how
  --deduplicate, --skip-duplicates, and\n    --clean-duplicates determine if a file
  is a duplicate.\n    Before, only content known to be present somewhere was considered\n
  \   a duplicate. Now, any content that has been annexed before will be\n    considered
  a duplicate, even if all annexed copies of the data have\n    been lost.\n    Note
  that --clean-duplicates and --deduplicate still check\n    numcopies, so won't delete
  duplicate files unless there's an annexed\n    copy.\n  * import: --deduplicate
  and --skip-duplicates were implemented\n    inneficiently; they unncessarily hashed
  each file twice. They have\n    been improved to only hash once.\n  * import: Added
  --reinject-duplicates.\n  * Added git template directory to Linux standalone tarball

  \   --show-progress.\n  * Revert ServerAliveInterval change in 6.20161111, which
  caused problems\n    with too many old versions of ssh and unusual ssh configurations.\n
  \   It should have not been needed anyway since ssh is supposted to\n    have TCPKeepAlive

  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  \"hexapodia as the key insight\"\n\n  * Added v6 repository
  mode, but v5 is still the default for now.\n  * unlock, lock: In v6 mode, unlocking
  a file changes it from a symlink to a\n    pointer file, and this change can be
  committed to the git repository.\n    For details, see http://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/unlocked_files/\n
  \ * The upgrade to version 6 is not done fully automatically yet, because\n    upgrading
  a direct mode repository to version 6 will prevent old\n    versions of git-annex
  from working in other clones of that repository.\n    For details, see http://git-annex.branchable.com/upgrades/\n
  \ * init: --version parameter added to control which supported repository\n    version
  to use.\n  * init, upgrade: Configure .git/info/attributes to use git-annex\n    as
  a smudge filter. In v6 repository mode, this makes git add\n    add files to the
  annex in unlocked mode, unless overridden by\n    annex.largefiles configuration.\n
  \ * assistant: In v6 mode, adds files in unlocked mode, so they can\n    continue
  to be modified.\n  * Added annex.thin setting, which makes unlocked files in v6
  repositories\n    be hard linked to their content, instead of a copy. This saves
  disk\n    space but means any modification of an unlocked file will lose the local\n
  \   (and possibly only) copy of the old version.\n  * Enable annex.thin by default
  on upgrade from direct mode to v6, since\n    direct mode made the same tradeoff.\n
  \ * fix: Adjusts unlocked files as configured by annex.thin.\n  * persistent-sqlite
  is now a hard build dependency, since v6 repository\n    mode needs it.\n\n\n  *
  status: On crippled filesystems, was displaying M for all annexed files\n    that

  present keys\n    twice.\n  * info --json: Improve json for \"backend usage\", using
  a nested object\n    with fields for each backend instead of the previous weird
  nested lists.\n    This may break existing parsers of this json output, if there
  were any.\n  * whereis --json: Make url list be included in machine-parseable form.\n
  \ * test: Added --keep-failures option.\n  * unused: Bug fix when a new file was
  added to the annex, and then\n    removed (but not git rmed). git still has the

  but unlikely to occur bug, where dropping\n    a file from a remote could race with
  other drops of the same file,\n    and result in all copies of its content being
  lost.\n  * git-annex-shell: Added lockcontent command, to prevent dropping of\n
  \   a key's content. This is necessary due to the above bugfix.\n  * In some cases,
  the above bugfix changes what git-annex allows you to\n    drop:\n    - When a file
  is present in several special remotes,\n      but not in any accessible git repositories,
  dropping it from one of\n      the special remotes will now fail. Instead, the file
  has to be\n      moved from one of the special remotes to the git repository, and
  can\n      then safely be dropped from the git repository.\n    - If a git remote
  has too old a version of git-annex-shell installed,\n      git-annex won't trust
  it to hold onto a copy of a file when dropping\n      that file from the local git
  repository.\n  * Changed drop ordering when using git annex sync --content or the\n
  \   assistant, to drop from remotes first and from the local repo last.\n    This
  works better with the behavior changes to drop in many cases.\n  * Do verification
  of checksums of annex objects downloaded from remotes.\n  * When annex objects are
  received into git repositories from other git\n    repos, their checksums are verified
  then too.\n  * To get the old, faster, behavior of not verifying checksums, set\n
  \   annex.verify=false, or remote.<name>.annex-verify=false.\n  * setkey, rekey:
  These commands also now verify that the provided file\n    matches the expected
  checksum of the key, unless annex.verify=false.\n  * reinject: Already verified
  content; this can now be disabled by\n    setting annex.verify=false.\n  * sync,
  merge, assistant: When git merge failed for a reason other\n    than a conflicted
  merge, such as a crippled filesystem not allowing\n    particular characters in
  filenames, git-annex would make a merge commit\n    that could omit such files or
  otherwise be bad. Fixed by aborting the\n    whole merge process when git merge
  fails for any reason other than a\n    merge conflict.\n  * Allow building with

  Standard preferred content for client, backup, incremental backup,\n    and unwanted

  preferred content expression to match\n    its documentation, which says it does
  not want files that have reached\n    a backup repository.\n  * Increased the default
  annex.bloomaccuracy from 1000 to 10000000.\n    This makes git annex unused use

  When adding a new box.com remote, use the new style chunking.\n    Thanks, Jon Ander
  Peñalba.\n  * External special remote protocol now includes commands for setting\n
  \   and getting the urls associated with a key.\n  * Urls can now be claimed by
  remotes. This will allow creating,\n    for example, a external special remote that
  handles magnet: and\n    *.torrent urls.\n  * Use wget -q --show-progress for less
  verbose wget output,\n    when built with wget 1.16.\n  * Added bittorrent special
  remote.\n  * addurl behavior change: When downloading an url ending in .torrent,\n
  \   it will download files from bittorrent, instead of the old behavior\n    of
  adding the torrent file to the repository.\n  * Added Recommends on aria2.\n  *
  When possible, build with the haskell torrent library for parsing\n    torrent files.
  As a fallback, can instead use btshowmetainfo from\n    bittornado | bittorrent.\n

  \ * undo: New command to undo the most recent change to a file\n    or to the contents
  of a directory.\n  * Add undo action to nautilus and konqueror integration.\n  *
  diffdriver: New git-annex command, to make git external diff drivers\n    work with
  annexed files.\n  * pre-commit: Block partial commit of unlocked annexed file, since\n
  \   that left a typechange staged in index due to some infelicity of git's\n    handling
  of partial commits.\n  * Work around behavior change in lsof 4.88's -F output format.\n
  \ * S3: Switched to using the haskell aws library.\n  * S3: No longer buffers entire
  files in memory when uploading without\n    chunking.\n  * S3: When built with a
  new enough version of the haskell aws library,\n    supports doing multipart uploads,
  in order to store extremely large\n    files in S3 when not using chunking.\n  *
  Don't show \"(gpg)\" when decrypting the remote encryption cipher,\n    since this
  could be taken to read that's the only time git-annex\n    runs gpg, which is not

  and the test suite fails on hurd.\n  * initremote: Don't allow creating a special
  remote that has the same\n    name as an existing git remote.\n  * Windows: Use
  haskell setenv library to clean up several ugly workarounds\n    for inability to
  manipulate the environment on windows. This includes\n    making git-annex not re-exec
  itself on start on windows, and making the\n    test suite on Windows run tests
  without forking.\n  * glacier: Fix pipe setup when calling glacier-cli to retrieve
  an object.\n  * info: When run on a single annexed file, displays some info about
  the \n    file, including its key and size.\n  * info: When passed the name or uuid
  of a remote, displays info about that\n    remote. Remotes that support encryption,
  chunking, or embedded\n    creds will include that in their info.\n  * enableremote:
  When the remote has creds, update the local creds cache\n    file. Before, the old

  when two separate\n    git-annex processes were both working to perform the same
  set of\n    transfers.\n  * sync: Ensure that pending changes to git-annex branch
  are committed\n    before push when in direct mode. (Fixing a very minor reversion.)\n
  \ * WORM backend: Switched to include the relative path to the file inside\n    the
  repository, rather than just the file's base name. Note that if you're\n    relying
  on such things to keep files separate with WORM, you should really\n    be using
  a better backend.\n  * Rather than crashing when there's a problem with the requested
  bloomfilter\n    capacity/accuracy, fall back to a reasonable default bloom filter
  size.\n  * Fix build with optparse-applicative 0.10. Closes: #761484\n  * webapp:

  making multiple http connections\n    when storing a file.\n  * WebDAV: Avoid buffering
  whole file in memory when uploading and\n    downloading.\n  * WebDAV: Dropped support
  for DAV before 1.0.\n  * testremote: New command to test uploads/downloads to a

  \   for the object, although of course the object's content cannot be deleted\n
  \   due to the nature of bup.\n  * unlock: Better error handling; continue past
  files that are not available\n    or cannot be unlocked due to disk space, and try
  all specified files.\n  * Windows: Now uses actual inode equivilants in new direct
  mode\n    repositories, for safer detection of eg, renaming of files with the same\n

  \ * Now handles the case where a file that's being transferred to a remote\n    is
  modified in place, which direct mode allows. When this\n    happens, the transfer
  now fails, rather than allow possibly corrupt\n    data into the remote.\n  * fsck:
  Better checking of file content in direct mode.\n  * drop: Suggest using git annex
  move when numcopies prevents dropping a file.\n  * webapp: Repo switcher filters
  out repos that do not exist any more\n    (or are on a drive that's not mounted).\n
  \ * webapp: Use IP address, rather than localhost, since some systems may\n    have
  configuration problems or other issues that prevent web browsers\n    from connecting
  to the right localhost IP for the webapp.\n  * webapp: Adjust longpoll code to work
  with recent versions of\n    shakespeare-js.\n  * assistant: Support new gvfs dbus
  names used in Gnome 3.6.\n  * In direct mode, files with the same key are no longer
  hardlinked, as\n    that would cause a surprising behavior if modifying one, where
  the other\n    would also change.\n  * webapp: Avoid illegal characters in hostname
  when creating S3 or\n    Glacier remote.\n  * assistant: Avoid committer crashing

  mode. In direct mode, files are accessed directly, rather than\n    via symlinks.
  Note that direct mode is currently experimental. Many\n    git-annex commands do
  not work in direct mode. Some git commands can\n    cause data loss when used in
  direct mode repositories.\n  * assistant: Now uses direct mode by default when setting
  up a new\n    local repository.\n  * OSX assistant: Uses the FSEvents API to detect
  file changes.\n    This avoids issues with running out of file descriptors on large
  trees,\n    as well as allowing detection of modification of files in direct mode.\n
  \   Other BSD systems still use kqueue.\n  * kqueue: Fix bug that made broken symlinks
  not be noticed.\n  * vicfg: Quote filename. Closes: #696193\n  * Bugfix: Fixed bug
  parsing transfer info files, where the newline after\n    the filename was included
  in it. This was generally benign, but in\n    the assistant, it caused unexpected
  dropping of preferred content.\n  * Bugfix: Remove leading \\ from checksums output
  by sha*sum commands,\n    when the filename contains \\ or a newline. Closes: #696384\n
  \ * fsck: Still accept checksums with a leading \\ as valid, now that\n    above

  \ * Added a annex.queuesize setting, useful when adding hundreds of thousands\n
  \   of files on a system with plenty of memory.\n  * whereis: Prints the urls of
  files that the web special remote knows about.\n  * addurl --fast: Verifies that
  the url can be downloaded (only getting\n    its head), and records the size in
  the key.\n  * When checking that an url has a key, verify that the Content-Length,\n
  \   if available, matches the size of the key.\n  * addurl: Added a --file option,
  which can be used to specify what\n    file the url is added to. This can be used
  to override the default\n    filename that is used when adding an url, which is
  based on the url.\n    Or, when the file already exists, the url is recorded as
  another\n    location of the file.\n  * addurl: Normalize badly encoded urls.\n

  be used to change the keys used\n    for files en masse.\n  * Store web special
  remote url info in a more efficient location.\n    (Urls stored with this version
  will not be visible to older versions.)\n  * Deal with NFS problem that caused a
  failure to remove a directory\n    when removing content from the annex.\n  * Make

  Uses a new \"git-annex-shell commit\" command when available.\n  * To avoid commits

  Now 10 times faster when scanning to find\n    files in a remote on a local disk;

  repository that you cannot run fsck in locally, it's\n    nice to have the ability
  to fsck it.\n  * If you have any directory special remotes, now would be a good
  time to\n    fsck them, in case you were hit by the data loss bug fixed in the\n

  caching is now enabled automatically by git-annex.\n    Only one ssh connection
  is made to each host per git-annex run, which\n    can speed some things up a lot,

  also share ssh connections.\n    Cached ssh connections are shut down when git-annex

  git-annex allows managing files with git, without checking the file
  contents into git. While that may seem paradoxical, it is useful when
  dealing with files larger than git can currently easily handle, whether due
  to limitations in memory, checksumming time, or disk space.
