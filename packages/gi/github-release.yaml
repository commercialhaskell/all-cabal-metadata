  # [GitHub Release][]

  [![CI](https://github.com/tfausak/github-release/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tfausak/github-release/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
  [![Hackage](https://badgen.net/hackage/v/github-release)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/github-release)

  GitHub Release is a command-line utility for uploading files to GitHub
  releases.

  Once you've got it, run it like so:

  ``` sh
  github-release upload \
    --token '...' \
    --owner 'someone' \
    --repo 'something' \
    --tag 'v1.2.3' \
    --file 'path/to/example.tgz' \
    --name 'example-1.2.3.tgz'
  ```

  You can generate a token on the [personal access tokens][] page of your
  personal settings. The `file` option is the path to the local file you want to
  upload. The `name` option is what the file should be called on the GitHub
  release.

  GitHub Release is written in Haskell. If you want to build it yourself or use
  it in your project, you'll want to get [Stack][]. Once you've done that, you
  can install and use it from the command line.

  ``` sh
  stack --resolver nightly install github-release
  stack exec -- github-release upload # as above ...
  ```

  Or you can use it from Haskell.

  ``` hs
  import qualified GitHubRelease
  GitHubRelease.upload
      "..."                 -- token
      "someone"             -- owner
      "something"           -- repo
      "1.2.3"               -- tag
      "path/to/example.tgz" -- file
      "example-1.2.3.tgz"   -- name
  ```
