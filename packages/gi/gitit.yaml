  Version 0.15.0.0 released 12 Aug 2021

    * Remove the Export feature entirely.
      There were too many security problems associated with exports.
      Given limitations on developer time, removing the feature entirely
      seemed the best solution.  API change: removed Network.Gitit.Export.

    * Fix dependencies to compile with ghc 9.

  Version 0.14.0.0 released 12 Aug 2021

    * PDF export: fix vulnerability.  Augustin Laville pointed
      out that it is possible to leak content from files on the
      file system in PDF export.  This can be done by simply including

          \include{/path/to/file}

      in the markdown; the raw tex is passed through to the
      LaTeX intermediary when producing a PDF.  In many cases
      this will lead to a LaTeX syntax error, but there are ways of
      injecting TeX includes into a verbatim environment.
      The solution is to cause latex to use a local texmf.cnf
      file when exporting PDF. The texmf.cnf file can specify
      openout_any = p and openin_any = p, which prevents access
      to hidden files and files outside the current tree.

    * Made SessionKey a newtype (API change).  This avoids orphan
      instance warnings.  Removed unused orphan `instance FromReqURI [String]`.

    * Remove deprecated `defaultCleanupHandler`.

    * Handle Underline element in converting inlines to strings.

    * Allow compilation with pandoc 2.12 and 2.13 (#670, sterni).
      pandoc 2.13 introduced the following breakages for gitit.

    * Allow building with pandoc-2.14 (#673, Jens Petersen).

    * Disable registration bug fixes (#669, zaxtax).
      Display correct html, fix precedence bug.

    * Add documentation and comment on disabling registration to
      default config (Rob Zinkov).

    * Add option for disabling registration (Rob Zinkov).

    * Depend on filestore >= 0.6.5 (with embedded data).

    * Relax version bounds in gitit.cabal to fix build from hackage
      (#665, sternenseemann).

    * Allow building with hoauth-1.14 (Jens Petersen).

  Version 0.13.0.0 released 03 June 2020

    * Allow building with GHC 8.8

      + Network.Gitit.Rpxnow: change return type of `authenticate` to
        avoid using removed instances of `Monad.fail`

    * Upgrade dependencies and add nix section to stack.yaml
      (Fabián Heredia Montiel).

    * Fixes to compile with feed-1.3.x (octalsrc).
      The changes to EntryContent in feed-1.2.0.0 were reverted
      in 1.3.0.0

    * Fixes to compile with network-3.x (octalsrc).
      network-3.0.0.0 moves the Network.BSD module into its own
      "network-bsd" package and removes deprecated API elements.  This
      requires a new dependency on "network-bsd" and a code change to stop
      using the removed inet_addr function.
      This change also adds < 3.2 as an upper bound for network (there was
      previously no upper bound).

    * Fixes to compile with hoauth2-1.11.x (octalsrc).
      This also fixes type mismatches that prevent compiling with
      hoauth-1.9.x

    * Fixes to compile with GHC 8.8.x, API change in Network.Gitit.Rpxnow
      (octalsrc).  GHC 8.8's base-4.13.0.0 removes `fail` from Monad,
      requiring a few uses of `fail` to be removed and the json dependency
      to be updated.  Because arbitrary `Monad` instances no longer
      support failure, the `Monad m` used in the return type of
      Network.Gitit.Rpxnow.authenticate has been fixed as `Either String`.

    * Allow pandoc 2.9.x.

    * Diff fixes in Feed.

    * Modernize cabal file (require cabal 2.0).

    * Changes to use filestore 0.6.4.

  Version 0.12.3.2 released 31 Dec 2018

    * Remove references to gitit.net in cabal file.
      gitit.net is no longer owned by the project and
      has not served a demo of gitit for some time (#627).

  Version 0.12.3.1 released 31 Dec 2018

    * Improve compatibility with GHC 8.6 (Phil Ruffwind, #625).

      + Replaced uses of uri (out of date package) with uri-bytestring, which
        gitit already uses in other places.
      + Bumped hoauth2 version bounds to support 1.8.*.

  Version 0.12.3 released 09 Oct 2018

    * Change hk-pyg.css to highlighting.css with new CSS for pandoc 2
      and skylighting 0.7.4. NOTE:  You must change your existing
      custom.css to refer to highlighting.css instead of
      hk-pyg.css, or highlighted code will not display properly.
    * Ensure that the proper extensions are used for each format.
    * Add Ext_emoji to readerExtensions (#616).
    * Add Paths_gitit to other-modules to avoid warning.
    * screen.css: remove special padding and border and color for code.
      This interferes with pandoc's new highlighting.
    * Fixed static in gitignore
    * Update stack.yaml, use latest lts-12.
    * Updates for pandoc 2.x (Myron Wu).
    * Require skylighting >= 0.7.4.
    * Remove jsMath as it was dropped from pandoc >= 2 (#617, Myron Wu).
    * Add Ext_emoji to readerExtensions (#616, Conal Elliott).
    * Changes to use recent versions of dependencies.
      Especially feed 1.0, which uses a different xml type
      and requires a new dependency on xml-conduit to render it.
    * Remove support for ghc versions < 8 (Myron Wu).
    * Bump hoauth2 to 1.3.0 && < 1.6 to catch up with nix and other
      curated package sets (Myron Wu).
    * Updated mathjax cdn to cloudflare.
    * Redirect to requested wiki page after github oauth callback (Myron Wu).
    * Use skylighting instead of deprecated highlighting-kate.

  Version 0.12.2.1 released 14 Feb 2017

    * Bump version bounds for time, pandoc, blaze-html, aeson.
    * Added MTable plugin (Simon Heath).
      Adds simple but easy-to-use variable-width table syntax.
    * Fixed Subst plugin (Simon Heath, #548).
    * Fixed Dot plugin (Simon Heath, #568).

  Version 0.12.2 released 09 Nov 2016

    * Allow pandoc 1.18, tagsoup 0.14, aeson, 1.x.

  Version 0.12.1.1 released 22 Mar 2016

    * Allow pandoc 1.17 (Phil Ruffwind).
    * Allow aeson 0.11.

  Version 0.12.1 released 17 Feb 2016

    * Use fmap instead of <$> so ghc 7.8 won't fail.
    * Allow latest hoauth2
    * Fix typo (Chas Leichner).
    * Allow compiling with pandoc 1.16.x.
    * Add page for login failure when authorization is required for reading
      (Phil Ruffwind).  When authorization is required to read the wiki, the
      error message from a failed GitHub login cannot be displayed.  Instead it
      will redirect to GitHub for another OAuth authentication, which can lead to
      a redirect loop.  To avoid this, the user is now redirected to a special
      landing page to display the login failure.  Note: no changes are made for
      the case where authorization is not required to read the wiki.
    * Improve error message of GitHub membership check (Phil Ruffwind).
    * Add delete-summary config variable (Phil Ruffwind).
      Used to change the commit message when a page is deleted.
    * Use primary GitHub email rather than just the first (Phil Ruffwind).
      The order in which user emails are returned via the GitHub API is not
      specified, so the first may not be the one that the user prefers,
      i.e. the so-called "primary" email.  To fix this problem, we eliminate
      all emails except for the one marked as "primary".
    * Make default theme responsive (Lincoln Mullen, #450).
      This commit makes the default theme responsive. For smaller browsers, it
      will move the sidebar below the main content div and make the sidebar
      three columns. On phones, it will also collapse the sidebar into a
      single column.
    * README: Tell how to enable rtsopts for disabling GC (norpol).

  Version 0.12.0.1 released 24 Aug 2015

    * Revert change of curly to straight quote for starting
      User's Guide page (Wouter Oosterveld).
    * stack.yaml: removed pandoc flag setting.

  Version 0.12 released 19 Aug 2015

    * Export all modules.
    * Make executable builds depend on the library in cabal file.
    * Moved library files to src directory.
    * Added stack.yaml.
    * Updated README with stack install instructions.

  Version 0.11.1.1 released 14 Aug 2015

    * Fixed Network.Gitit.Initialize so it compiles with older pandoc (#506).
    * Removed extra import of liftIO in Dot.hs plugin.

  Version 0.11.1 released 23 Jul 2015

    * Allow `commonmark` as a page type.
    * Handle CommonMark page type on initialization.

  Version 0.11 released 02 Jun 2015

    * Allow page extensions to be configurable (not just `.page`)
      (Caleb McDaniel).
      - Added `page-extension` option in config file (Caleb McDaniel).
      - Added new type for `defaultExtension`
      - Changed `isPageFile` to get extension from config
      - New function `isNotDiscussPageFile`
      - `pathForPage` must be passed extension as String
      - `isPageFile` now returns GititServerPart Bool instead of just Bool.
    * Reverted some changes to Plugins that caused excessive memory use.
    * Allow pandoc 1.15.
    * Added missing `<br>` tag in form on registration page (Vaughn Iverson).
    * Show page diffs in feed (Imuli).
    * Display commit messages in feed entry titles (Imuli).
    * Fix preview button for modern jQuery (Imuli).
    * Feed titles reflect site and page names (Imuli).
    * Present feed in canonical order (recent first, Imuli).
    * https support for base-url config option (Imuli).

  Version 0.10.7 released 02 Jun 2015

    * Fixes to allow building with pandoc 1.14. `CommonMark` added
      as a constructor of `PageType`.  CommonMark can now be used as
      a page format and is also available for page export.
    * Plugins:  added some recommended option flags.
    * Allow `---` as well as `...` to end metadata (#493).
    * README: changed dead links (Rick Hanson).

  Version 0.10.6.3 released 08 May 2015

    * README:  use shortcut style markdown links.
    * Fixed profiling options.
    * Added .travis.yml.
    * Allow both time >= 1.5.0.0 and time < 1.5.0.0 with old-locale
      (Michal Antkiewicz)

  Version 0.10.6.2 released 02 April 2015

    * Bumped upper version bounds.
    * Fix typos in README.markdown (Igor Vuk).
    * Update bug tracker link (Waldir Pimenta).

  Version 0.10.6.1 released 28 October 2014

    * Added Network.Gitit.Compat.Except to cabal module list.

  Version 0.10.6 released 28 October 2014

    * Escape HTML characters in user name when showing it on a web page.
      This addresses a security flaw in previous versions, pointed out
      by Davy Stoffel.  A fake password reset email could be provided
      to users, with the link:

          http://gitit.net/_doResetPassword?reset_code=azeaze&username=
          davy%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E

      If the person clicked the link, the unknown username would be
      displayed (unescaped), and the javascript would run.
      This fix addresses the flaw, not by preventing the funny user name,
      but by ensuring that the HTML tags are escaped when the user name
      is shown on the page.

    * Network.Gitit.Initialize: Allow mediawiki for default pages.

    * Enable readerParseRaw for all formats.
      This will enable things like script and iframe tags to get
      parsed from HTML sources, and unrecognized latex tags from LaTeX.

    * Refined github login (Freiric Barral).

    * Include jquery sources in sdist tarballs (Anthony Towns).

    * Add support for `mediawiki` as a page format (Raymond Gauthier).

  Version 0.10.5.1 released 21 September 2014

    * Added markup help for org mode.  Closes #449.

    * Utils.parsePageType:  Added case for "org".

    * Allow newer versions of dependencies.

  Version 0.10.5 released 23 August 2014

    * Added github login option (Freiric Barral).

    * Change default math display to mathjax.

    * Relaxed package bounds, fixed compiler warnings.
      Added Network.Gitit.Compat.Except module for compatibility
      with earlier and later mtl versions.

    * Added network-uri flag to accommodate network-uri/network split.

    * Fixed failure when loading the Subst plugin (Glenn Searby).

    * Added Makefile, for use in installing on server.

    * Include takeBaseName in System.FilePath import (Caleb McDaniel).

    * Update README.markdown on Apache installation (Peter Gallagher).

    * Add full versions of minified JavaScript (#400) (Peter Gallagher).

    * Enable highlighting of patterns that start or end with punctuation
      (Caleb McDaniel).

    * Moved oauth secret to separate config file (Freiric Barral).

    * Corrected MathJax CDN URL (Maciek Makowski).

  Version 0.10.4 released 30 Jun 2014

  *   Updated package bounds for happstack (#382), pandoc, blaze-html,
      network.

  *   Display EPS as image, not code.

  *   Fixed recent activity page for binary files (Sergey Koposov).

  *   Use normal spaces instead of nbsp in activity page (Sergey Koposov).

  *   Display a delete link next to uploads in file list (rekado).

  *   Change _search to use HTTP GET, so searches can be linked
      and refreshed (Joe Hillenbrand).

  *   Document mod_proxy_html setting in README.  Added a mod_proxy_html
      configuration directive to insert a DOCTYPE string (Johann Visagie).

  *   Added new template variables `isdiscusspage`, `isarticleUrl`,
      `discussionUrl`.  This makes it possible to treat discussion pages
      specially in templates, and insert appropriate links (Shane O'Brien).

  *   Added template variables `articlename`, `discussionname`,
      `isarticlepage` (Shane O'Brien).

  *   Added redirects (#233).  You can now create a redirect page by adding
      a `redirect` field to the metadata of a page (Shane O'Brien).

      - When a user visits a redirect page, they are redirected to the
        destination page.
      - At the destination page, a message is displayed telling the user
        that they have been redirected from the source page. A link is
        provided back to the source page, with a parameter to disable the
        redirect (so that it can be edited).
      - Gitit will detects circular redirects and explain to the user
        what is going on in such cases.

  *   Added "search for pages containing..." option to `createPage`.
      Changed "page not found" page to give the option of searching for
      the page name or creating a page with that name (Shane O'Brien).

  *   Set `pgTitle` in `showDiff` (Shane O'Brien).

  *   Made the default "since" for the activity page configurable
      (Shane O'Brien).

  *   Only set the `tabs` template variable if there are tabs (Shane O'Brien).

  *   Removed access question from password reset form. It's only
      needed for the register form (Shane O'Brien).

  *   Added `for` attribute to all labels on forms (Shane O'Brien).

  *   Updated `pageToString` to use new metadata format (Shane O'Brien).

  *   Handlers: Fixed duplicate function defn for `fileAnchor`.

  *   Added `Org` and `BocBook` to `PageType` (API change).  Pages
      may now be written in Ord mode or DocBook syntax.

  *   Allow multiple categories, separated by commas,
      in a `_category` URL (Caleb McDaniel).  The pages in all listed
      categories will be returned.

  *   Added filter links for `_category` pages (Cabel McDaniel).

  *   Fixed image exports in Docx, RTF, slides, PDF (#399, #353).

  *   Restored inline syntax highlighting.

  *   Fixed highlighting in exports (#356).

  *   Added `ICML` and `beamer` as export formats (#391).

  *   Added github-style backgrounds to code blocks (Joe Hillenbrand).

  *   Lighter heading border (like wikimedia) (Joe Hillenbrand).

  *   Fixed links on activity page (Shane O'Brien).

  *   Added markup help for Textile, Org, DocBook (#434).

  *   Modified plugins/Subst.hs to work with latest pandoc (Tianyi Cui).

  *   Fixed wiki links when `base-url` is empty and `absolute-urls` yes
      (Tianyi Cui).

  *   README:  document that changes to templates require a restart (Raphael).


  Version 0.10.3.1 released 19 Mar 2013

  *   Fixed filename encoding problem affecting caching,
      for gitit compiled with GHC 7.4 or later.

  *   Fixed padding on some buttons (akerbos).

  *   Specify correct format in header for initial pages (benmachine).

  Version 0.10.3 released 09 Mar 2013

  *   Allow latest versions of pandoc, blaze-html, HStringTemplate.

  *   Fixed duplicate ids in user box.

  *   Added `mathjax-script` option, specifies the mathjax script to
      use. (Dmitry Gerasimov.)

  *   Set focus on editedText on page load.  (Mathieu Larose.)

  *   Added `address` config option.  (Matieu Larose.)

  Version 0.10.2 released 09 Feb 2013

  *   Updated to work with pandoc 1.10.

  *   Fixed path for MathMLInHTML.js script.  Closes #345.
      Thanks to tstgruby.

  *   Updated interwiki plugin (gwern).

  *   Made it possible to export pages with images stored in the
      repository itself (as opposed to the static directory).  Thanks
      to Claudio Bley for the patch.

  Version 0.10.1.2 released 11 Jan 2013

  *   Fixed regression in option parsing.  An earlier patch
      caused the '-f' option not to work.  Closes #336.

  Version 0.10.1.1 released 01 Jan 2013

  *   Allow compilation with directory < 1.2.

  Version 0.10.1 released 31 Dec 2012

  *   Fixed duplicate dropExtension on categoryPage.  (atsuo yamada)
      This created problems with categories containing periods.

  *   Fixed duplicate unescaping of HTML entities. (atsuo yamada)

  *   Supply $revision$ at _diff if "Changes from beginning to..."
      (atsuo yamada)

  *   MathJax rendering is now working in edit preview mode
      (Dmitry Gerasimov).

  *   Upgrade directory package dependency to 1.2, and
      fix compilation issue with GHC 7.6.1 (Bin Jin).

  *   Allow metadata keys to include digits, _, -.  Closes #328.

  *   Don't read config for --help or --version (Ben Millwood).
      Also involves a refactor of options into those that make the program
      quit immediately, and those that just alter the configuration.

  *   Updated to use filestore 0.6 (new diff API).
      Thanks to markwright for partial patch.

  *   Include format metadata in default installed pages.
      This allows them to continue working when the user changes the
      default page format.  Closes #329.

  *   Added explicit path to Gitit User's Guide in default front page.

  *   Fix Gitit User's Guide link on front page.
      Previously it was broken due to "smart punctuation."

  *   Fixed validation messages.  Switched from using lookRead "messages"
      to using looks "message" for messages.  Closes #294.

  Version 0.10.0.2 released 02 Nov 2012

  *   Raised version bounds for dependencies.

  *   Updated post-update script to use new forms of git commands.
      Closes #317.

  *   Fixed withTempDir so it returns to old directory.
      Closes #303.  This is a slightly different solution than the one
      proposed by tstgruby, but it has the advantage that only withTempDir
      itself needs to be changed.

  *   Added nginx example for proxy setup (README) (Andre Kelpe).

  Version 0.10.0.1 released 07 Jun 2012

  *   Fixed double-encoding bug for unicode page names
      (Alexander Vershilov).

  *   Require happstack-server >= 7.

  Version 0.10 released 30 May 2012

  *   Changed 'readFileUTF8' so it doesn't encode filename on ghc 7.4.

  *   Upgraded for compatibility with blaze-html 0.5.  Closes #299.

  *   Improved categories. Files are now read strictly to avoid a 'too
      many open files' error. 'Page' now exports 'readCategories' instead of
      'extractCategories'.

  *   Require filestore 0.5.  This brings in (a) correct handling
      of unicode paths when compiled under GHC 7.4, and (b) a 'limit'
      parameter for 'history'. The limit parameter is essential when
      gitit is used with very large repositories; otherwise history
      commands would have to parse the entire log.  Handler functions
      that use 'history' have been updated to use the optional
      'limit' parameter.

  *   Atom feeds are now limited to 200 entries, to prevent server
      overload.

  *   Indicate size of default logo picture in README. Closes #291.

  *   Added a README section on restricting access.  Closes #292.

  Version 0.9.0.1 released 15 Feb 2012

  *   Fixed bug in fromEntities that caused text to be lost in the page
      source after semicolons.  Thanks to Perry Wagle for reporting the bug.

  *   Updated code to run on happstack 7.

  *   Removed dependency on happstack-util; depend on base64-bytestring
      instead.

  *   Updated gitit.cabal to include footnotes.js (Ben Sinclair).

  Version 0.9 released 29 Feb 2012

  *   Gitit now uses the latest pandoc (1.9.x) and happstack-server (6.6.x),
      and compiles on ghc 7.4.1.

  *   Added Docx, AsciiDoc, and DZSlides as export formats.

  *   HTML slide show exports are now "self-contained":  they embed all
      required js, css, and images, so they can be used offline.

  *   Allow spaces in usernames (Juraj Hercek).

  *   Improve PDF/RTF exports containing images in the wiki.
      Wikidata paths are translated to absolute ones, so pandoc/pdflatex
      can find them (Juraj Hercek).

  *   Protect against XSS in slide show exports.  Previous versions
      of gitit sanitized wikipages, but not HTML slide shows.

  *   Table of contents is now in a div with ID `TOC`, so it can
      be styled.

  *   Removed letter and word spacing from print.css.

  *   Added s5 directory to static.  This is needed by pandoc 1.9.

  *   Updated Interwiki plugin (gwern).

  *   Added `fromEntities` to `Types`, since `decodeCharacterReferences`
      is no longer exported from Pandoc.  Added dependency on tagsoup.

  *   Provided `FromReqURI` instance for `[String]`, since
      this is not automatic with recent happstack.

  Version 0.8.1 released 02 Sep 2011

  *   Support mathjax as a math option.
      Added MathJax as MathMethod, and mathjax as an option in
      the 'math' config field.  Resolves GoogleCode 122.

  *   Added xss-sanitize configuaration option.
      Setting it to 'no' turns off sanitization, enabling
      file:// URLs and other things that get filtered out
      by xss-sanitize.

  *   Listen interface explanation on help file could be more clear (#266)
      (andyring)

  *   Add the new configuration option 'absolute-urls'.
      When turned on, this makes wikilinks absolute w.r.t. the base-url.
      By default, they are relative.  So, for example, in a wiki served
      at the path 'wiki', on a page Sub/Page, the wikilink '[Cactus]()'
      will produce a link to '/wiki/Cactus' if absolute-urls is on,
      and otherwise the relative link 'Cactus'.  Patch due to lemmih.

  *   Change default listen address to 0.0.0.0.

  *   Serve svg file as image, not source code!

  *   Page history:  use 'limit' instead of restricting to past year.
      limit defaults to 100.  If 100 are displayed, you'll get a
      "Show more..." link that will increase the limit.
      Also fixed bug that caused a 404 when no history was returned.

  *   Require pandoc >= 1.8.2.

  *   Allow build with happstack-server 6.2.

  *   Updated for use with xss-sanitize 0.3, which uses Text.
      New dependency on text.

  Version 0.8.0.1 released 07 Jun 2011

  * Fixed file upload problem with recent versions of directory
    package. (Thanks to Oliver Braun.)

  * Relaxed some version upper bounds.

  Version 0.8 released 13 May 2011

  * Uses happstack 6.

  * Added textile and org export formats, textile page format.

  * Added support for RPXNow authentication, based on a patch from
    Pasqualino Titto Assini.

  * Added `authentication-required` field in config.

      * If set to 'modify', authentication is required to modify the wiki.
      * If set to 'read', atuhentication is required to view the wiki.
      * If set to 'none', authentication is never required, and pages can
        be edited anonymously.

      API changes:

      * currentUser moved to Authentication module
      * requireAuthentication added to Config
      * Added AuthenticationLevel type
      * requireUser renamed authenticate, parameter for AuthenticationLevel
        added; requireUserThat renamed authenticateUserThat

  * MathML and jsMath now work in the preview pane (Sean Seefried).

  * Use footnotes.js for fancy footnote styling (gwern).

  * Added a `--listen` parameter to specify the listen device
    (Timo B. Hübel).

  * Removed withInput.

  * Replaced fileContents with filePath in Params.

  * Fixed bug in uploadForm.js which caused a prefix to be added in the
    default wikiname.


  Version 0.7.3.12 released 01 Feb 2011

  * Use pandoc 1.8.

  * New export formats: textile, org.

  * New page form: textile.

  Version 0.7.3.11 released 28 Jan 2011

  * Allow time 1.2.

  Version 0.7.3.10 released 26 Jan 2011

  * Updated for filestore-0.4.0.2.  Gitit should now compile with ghc 7.
    Note:  It may be necessary to supply the --disable-library-for-ghci
    flag to 'cabal install highlighting-kate'.

  Version 0.7.3.9 released 25 Jan 2011

  * Removed dependency on cautious-file.
    It no longer seems to be actively maintained, and the current
    configuration does not compile on windows.

  * Removed dependency on datetime package.
    It is no longer maintained.
    Everything can be done just as well with the time package.

  * Depend on filestore >= 0.4 (without datetime dependency).

  * Bump version bounds on hslogger, network and HTTP.

  * Support for GHC 7.0 in Plugins (thanks to Max Bollingbroke).

  * Use xss-sanitize for sanitizing HTML.
    Previously pandoc's sanitization was used, but this will be
    removed in the next pandoc release. xss-sanitize is a more complete
    solution, and also prevents people from messing up layout by inserting
    unbalanced </div>.

  * Updated Feed module to make it decouplable from gitit.

  * jQuery.load wasn't working on Safari. Use jQuery.post instead.
    Also, the convert function was not always in scope. (It is only in
    scope when MathML is enabled?) We check if it is defined before
    calling it.  (Thanks to Sean Seefried.)

  * Export Page module.

  * Templates are in data directory

  * Fixed bug in Subst plugin (Lars Petersen).
    Subst plugin could not deal with non-existing pages, resulting
    in an server error when trying to substitute with an absent file.
    This patch now creates a link to the page in order to create it.

  * Added alt attribute to logo.

  Version 0.7.3.8 released 24 July 2010

  * Fixed MathML in Slidy and S5 exports.

  * Use languagesByFilename instead of languagesByExtension in isSource.

  Version 0.7.3.7 released 24 July 2010

  * Depend on pandoc >= 1.6, highlighting-kate >= 0.2.7.1

  * Added epub and slidy export formats.

  * Require happstack >= 0.5.

  * Added google math option (uses google charts api).
    Slightly modified from a patch by lpeterse.

  * Made WebArchiver plugin more parallel (gwern).

  * Fixed Dot plugin to work with GHC 6.12.
    We were having string encoding issues reading the output
    of dot with readProcess. Solution is to pass dot an output
    filename so we don't have to read its output.

  Version 0.7.3.6 released 05 May 2010

  * Fixed ODT/PDF export for files in subdirectories.  Resolves Issue #81.

  * Fix image URLs before calling the ODT or PDF processors

  * Added plain text export format.

  * Raised upper bound for datetime, parsec, and happstack dependencies.

  * Fix wikilinks to they don't get a leading slash.
    This reverts a bug introduced by 2128afb070b7, which added leading
    slashes to wikilinks, breaking them for people using gitit as a
    library on a path other than /.

  Version 0.7.3.5 released 21 Mar 2010

  * Returned to using pandoc's MathML writer option.
    This is fixed in pandoc 1.5.0.1. Depend on pandoc >= 1.5.0.1.

  Version 0.7.3.4 released 21 Mar 2010

  * Use custom readFileUTF8 (exported in Network.Gitit.Util) instead of
    broken System.IO.UTF8. This way we have a uniform solution for GHC
    6.10 and 6.12, and don't have to use CPP tricks. This change fixes
    categories on GHC 6.12. Resolves Issue #98.

  Version 0.7.3.3 released 21 Mar 2010

  * Reverted to handling math in MathML mode in the old way, using
    a transform, rather than relying on pandoc's MathML writer option.
    The latter was causing amazing CPU and memory usage, for reasons
    I don't yet understand.  This should fix the problem for now.

  * Fixed caching for unicode page names.

  * Added max-page-size config option. Thanks to Jinjing Wang for the patch.

  * Prevented _expire/ from failing if the page is not cached.

  * Fixed URL encoding for pages. (Note: Don't use + for spaces;
    that breaks the Ctrl-R cache expiration.)

  Version 0.7.3.2 released 20 Mar 2010

  * Fixed editing of pages when max-upload-size=0.
    max-upload-size should not double as max-page-size.
    Resolves Issue #96.

  Version 0.7.3.1 released 20 Mar 2010

  * Changed "In" to "in" in MathMLinJS.js link.

  Version 0.7.3 released 20 Mar 2010

  * Added PDF export option and pdf-export config field.
    (Based on a patch by gwern.)

  * Added markdown export.

  * Use pandoc's new MathML math mode for more efficient
    MathML.

  * Improved multi-wiki example code in haddocks.

  * Added session-timeout config setting.

  * Config module:  Added readSize (recognizing K,M,G suffix).
    Previously readNumber always recognized K,M,G suffixes,
    but these only make sense in some contexts (not e.g. for
    times).

  * Added Subst plugin (thanks to gwern).

  * Added notes on PDF caching and idle.

  * Fixed table of contents in wiki pages (resolving Issue #91).

  * Added pandoc-user-data config option, allowing the user
    to specify a directory with e.g. templates that override
    the defaults used for exported pages.

  * Fix filesToClean GHC panic when loading plugins on GHC HEAD

  * Fixed problem with doubled // in updir links.
    Resolves Issue #88.

  * Updated interwiki plugin.

  * Fixed caching for feeds. Thanks to brian.sniffen for pointing
    out the need to normalize the time diff. Resolves Issue #87.

  * Improved Feed module (gwern).

  * Use line anchors from highlighting-source, so that you can link
    directly to a particular line in a source file.

  * Disable upload functionality if maxUploadSize is 0.

  * Exported queryGititState, updateGititState, Network.Gitit.Layout.
    Exported filledPageTemplate. (Thanks to tphyahoo.)
    Split off and expose createDefaultPages.
    Exposed compilePageTemplate.

  * Use charset=utf-8 on output from Layout.

  * Use isUnescapedInURI with escapeURIString rather than isAllowedInURI.
    The latter does not escape % signs.

  Version 0.7.2 released 02 Jan 2010

  * Now compiles with GHC 6.12.

  Version 0.7.1 released 02 Jan 2010

  * Updated exports to work with pandoc 1.4.

  * Began updating to work with GHC 6.12. (Still untested; there may
    be further issues involving filestore.)

  Version 0.7 released 20 Dec 2009

  * Updated cabal file to allow happstack 0.4.

  * Added support for the new mercurial filestore backend.
    (Depending on filestore >= 0.3.4.)

  * Depend on xml >= 1.3.5.  This fixes a bug in the display of
    mathml.  Previously the self-closed tags in matrices with empty
    cells confused browsers and caused them to construct the
    DOM incorrectly. The problem is fixed by using xml's new
    ppcElement function to render the MathML without self-closed tags.

  * Depend on pandoc >= 1.3.

  * Properly handle UTF-8 in config files.

  * Moved option parsing code from Config module to main program.
    The Config module now exports getConfigFromFile instead of
    getConfigFromOpts. This should be more useful for those using gitit as
    a library.

  * Use wikiTitle config field in default HTML title.

  * Improved search results:
    + Highlight search terms in search results.
      Partially resolves Issue #76.
    + Made search results message uniform when no results.
    + Search: don't match page name against empty patterns.
    + Allow search matches on subdirectory part of page name.
    + Search:  catch error status from filestore search.
      Filestore <= 0.3.3 does not properly handle the error status
      returned by later versions of 'git grep' when no match is found.
      The problem has been fixed in darcs filestore.

  * CSS tweaks:
    + Removed base-min.css, folded necessary styles into screen.css.
    + Removed 'text-align: left' for th from CSS reset.

  * Feed improvements:
    + Modified feed handling so that feeds validate.
    + Perform proper escaping in Feed.hs (thanks to gwern).
    + Don't reveal author email in feeds.
    + Sitewide feed is /_feed/ (with trailing slash).
    + Add "http://" to base-url config option if needed.

  * Use + for spaces in URLs linking to wiki pages and folders.

  * Updated plugins:
    + Updated Interwiki plugin (gwern).
    + Modified WebArchiver plugin to make Alexa requests (gwern).

  Version 0.6.6 released 06 Nov 2009

  * Require filestore >= 0.3.3, which closes a security
    vulnerability.

  * Don't allow web file uploads to the static or templates directory,
    even if these are subdirectories of the repository directory.
    We don't want users uploading new CSS, javascript, or templates
    that might break the site.

  * Renamed gitit-dog.png -> logo.png in data/static/img.
    This way the logo will show up even without a local img directory.
    Thanks to Thomas Hartmann for the patch.

  * Return 404 when page not found.  Thanks to Richard Fergie.

  * Improved layout of Export button.

  * Added links for atom feeds to sitenav.st and pagetools.st, to
    make the feeds more discoverable.

  * Minor code safety improvements.

  * Check for commit messages consisting of whitespace.
    Commit messages consisting only of whitespace characters are
    rejected by Git as empty. Gitit should behave similarly.

  * Allow gitit to start up if custom template directory not found.
    Thanks to Thomas Hartmann.

  * Fixed incorrect usage of nullGroup (a debugging function).  Thanks
    to Thomas Hartmann.

  Version 0.6.5 released 06 Oct 2009

  * Added metadata to Page and Context, provided askMeta for plugins.
    This patch gives plugins access to all of the key/value pairs
    in the page metadata block.  Thanks to Dan Cook.

  * Added PigLatin plugin to demonstrate use of askMeta.

  * Display informative message on authentication failure.

  * Fixed library stanza in cabal file so plugins are properly enabled.

  Version 0.6.4 released 28 Sep 2009

  * Fixed preview javascript so that tex math works properly in
    preview.

  Version 0.6.3 released 27 Sep 2009

  * Fixed MathML conversion so it doesn't happen when exporting to
    non-HTML output formats.

  * Fixed shadowing on page templates: previously page.st was always
    taken from the defaults, even if a modified version existed
    in templates/.

  * Modified YUI CSS reset so that ordered list enumerators can be
    styled properly.

  * Modified showPage to work with both POST and GET requests.

  Version 0.6.2 released 25 Aug 2009

  * Use "reference obfuscation" for emails, rather than javascript
    obfuscation, which seems to interfere with preview.  Resolves
    Issue #59.

  Version 0.6.1 released 25 Aug 2009

  Instructions for upgrading from 0.5.3:

  - If you were using a Haskell configuration file, you will
    need to create a new configuration file. 'gitit --print-default-config'
    will print a self-documenting default configuration file in the new
    format, which you can modify.

  - If your wiki contains discuss pages of the form 'foo:discuss.page',
    rename them to '@foo.page'.

  - Delete template.html and the static directory so that these will
    be replaced by the newest versions when you run gitit. If you have
    customized these, you should back them up first, then merge your
    changes into the new versions after they are created. (Note that
    template.html will be replaced by a templates/ directory.)

  Summary of main changes:

  * Added support for plugins -- dynamically loaded Haskell programs that
    transform pages. See the haddock documentation for Gitit.Interface for
    plugin documentation. The plugins directory contains several sample
    plugins.

  * Gitit's configuration file is now a text file with key-value pairs,
    rather than a Haskell file.  The default configuration file
    (which can be printed using `gitit --print-default-config`
    contains comments that document all of the options.

  * Pages may now be written in (limited dialects of) LaTeX or HTML,
    as well as markdown and reStructuredText.  The default format
    is determined by a configuration option, but can be overridden
    on a per-page basis using metadata (see below).  The default
    Front Page and Help page are created in the default format specified
    by the configuration file. In addition, syntax help is now displayed
    to the left of the editing box when a page is being edited.

  * Pages may be written in literate Haskell, using either bird
    style with markdown or reStructuredText, or LaTeX style with
    LaTeX.  Literate Haskell can be made the default or specified on
    a per-page basis.

  * Gitit now exports a library, Network.Gitit, that makes it easy for
    any happstack application to embed a gitit wiki.

  * Added optional atom feeds, for whole site (at /_feed)
    and for individual pages (at /_feed/path/to/page).
    Feeds are cached with a configurable expiration time.

  * Completely new caching system.  Caching is turned off by default and
    can be enabled by a configuration option.  Complete pages are cached
    on disk and expired when pages are revised through the web interface.
    When pages are modified directly through a VCS, the cache must be
    refreshed manually, either by pressing Ctrl-R while viewing a page,
    or by sending an HTTP request to /_expire/path/to/page, or by using
    the included program expireGititPath. The new system is much faster
    than the old in-memory cache, because it avoids the considerable
    overhead of filestore calls to get the current revision id.

  * To make whole-page caching possible, the user login/out box has been
    made into an ajax request to /_user.  jQuery is now loaded on every
    page.

  * Math is converted to MathML by default (using the texmath library),
    and a javascript is linked in that renders it correctly in IE+mathplayer,
    Firefox, and Opera.  The 'math' configuration setting can alternatively
    be set to 'jsMath' (to use jsMath javascript, which is more portable
    but ugly and slower) or 'raw' (plain LaTeX code).

  * Routing changes for better handling of web spiders.  Instead of
    "/foo?history" we now have "/_history/foo"; instead of "/foo?edit"
    we haev "/_edit/foo"; etc.  This makes it possible to exclude web
    spiders from non-cached pages by excluding URLs that start with
    '/_'.  A default robots.txt file is now provided.  Users need not
    do anything special for this to be enabled.

  * The authentication system has been revised and made much more
    flexible. In the configuration file, you can specify either
    'form', 'http', or 'generic' as authentication-method. Form
    authentication is the old form-based gitit authentication system. HTTP
    authentication presupposes that the wiki pages are locked down under
    HTTP authentication; the gitit user will be set to the username used
    for HTTP authentication. Generic authentication takes the username
    from the REMOTE_USER request header. When gitit is being used as a
    library, one can specify a custom withUser filter (which determines
    the logged in user and sets REMOTE_USER accordingly) and a custom
    authHandler (including handlers for /_login, /_logout, and whatever
    else is needed).

  * Security fix: Gitit did not verify that a change password request
    is genuine when it receives the final POST. It has been changed to
    re-verify the reset code, otherwise an attacker could simply steal
    anyone's account by spoofing a POST request. (Thanks to Robin Green.)

  * template.html has now been replaced by a directory, templates/, with
    separate templates for each component of a page.

  * Added /_reloadTemplates action that recompiles the templates. (By
    default the templates are compiled only on startup.)

  * Gitit's form-based authentication now includes a "password reset"
    email.  Slightly modified from a patch from Henry Laxen.

  * The naming scheme for discussion pages has changed: the discussion
    page for foo is now @foo, not foo:discuss. Reason: Windows, and
    thus darcs, does not like colons in filenames.

  * Improved logging, with configurable verbosity.

  * Major code reorganization and cleanup.  Gitit has been moved under
    the Network namespace. The old WebT handlers are replaced by new ones
    in ServerPartT. 'handle' has been removed; instead, we use happstack's
    routing combinators. Configuration and filestores are now passed
    around in a reader monad, in WikiState. (This also allows different
    wikis to have different configurations.) Most handlers have been
    simplified so that they no longer require Page and Params arguments.
    A new function, 'withInput', is used to avoid the need to pass Params
    between handlers.

  * The static handler now "falls back" to the cabal data directory if the
    requested file is not in "static" (or staticDir).  So the user need
    no longer have a copy of the standard gitit CSS, javascript, and
    image files in "static" (unless these are to be overridden). This
    should make updates easier.  By default only 'custom.css' and
    'logo.png' are put in the user's static directory.

  * Similarly, the templates in "templates" "fall back" to defaults in
    the cabal data directory.  By default only 'footer.st' is put in
    the user's static directory.

  * Gitit State now includes a renderPage function. This is more flexible
    than storing a page template, since the user may want to use a custom
    page rendering function, even one not based on string templates.

  * Added Network.Gitit.ContentTransformer module (thanks to Anton van
    Straaten). The ContentTransformer module replaces Gitit.Convert. It
    defines a number of single-purpose combinators that can be combined to
    yield various kinds of content conversions. These are used to define
    showPage, preview, showHighlightedSource, and other handlers that used
    to be defined in Gitit.hs.

  * Verify in delete POST requests that filetodelete parameter matches
    page.

  * Fixed revert when called from diff pages. Revert now reverts to the
    older of the two revisions being compared.

  * Revamped auto-merging: user must now verify an edited page after
    a merge, even if there were no conflicts.

  * Fixed Content-Disposition header on export so that filenames have
    proper extensions.

  * Updated for happstack-server-0.3.3.  Since this version of happstack
    supports UTF-8, gitit's old manual decoding and encoding were removed.

  * Use fileServeStrict instead of fileServe.  Resolves Issue #57.

  * 'limit' is no longer used in search.  The way it worked before was
    confusing, since it limited total matches (usually to just a few files)
    rather than limiting the number of matches in each file.

  * rdgreen's cautious-file library is now used to write the gitit-users
    file. This makes it less likely that the file will be corrupted on
    a power outage or hardware failure.

  * Redirects set properly after account creation.  If users go from
    the Login form to the Register form, they are no longer redirected
    back to the Login form after creating an account.

  * indexPage now uses filestore's new 'directory' function. It shows one
    directory at a time. Subdirectories link to further index pages. This
    improves on the old javascript folding interface, which did not preserve
    state.  (Thanks to Thomas Hartman for suggestions.)

  * URLs of the form /a/b/ are now equivalent to /_index/a/b.

  * Improvements and bug fixes to deleting. Deleting a non-page now works.
    You get a nice informative message if you try to delete a nonexistent
    page or file.

  * Page names containing "..", "?", or "*", and '_' at beginning are
    disallowed. Page names may now contain periods.

  * The "Permanent link" link has been removed. It relied on the sha1
    parameter always being set, but we've changed that for performance
    reasons.

  * Gitit can now be proxied to a subdirectory path. Thanks to Henry Laxen
    for the idea and patches. See README for instructions.

  * Performance improvements (mostly due to Gwern Branwen):  Pages can be
    compressed (configurable); unneeded filestore calls removed; cache-control:
    max-age used.

  * Moved sidebar to end of HTML to make things easier for screen readers.

  * Moved search box and go box to templates.

  * Yahoo YUI CSS framework is now used for better consistency across browsers.
    CSS cleaned up.  Icons for page types removed.

  * Fixed handling of 'forUser' parameter in 'recent activity'.

  * Made default maxUploadSize 10 Mb.

  * Renamed AppState -> GititState.

  Version 0.5.3 released 1 Feb 2009

  * Fixed bug which caused jsMath not to load.

  Version 0.5.2 released 1 Feb 2009

  * Fixed cookie problem caused by empty value fields.

  Version 0.5.1 released 1 Feb 2009

  * Major code reorganization, making gitit more modular.

  * Gitit can now optionally be built using Happstack instead of HAppS
    (just use -fhappstack when cabal installing).

  * Fixed bug with directories that had the same names as pages.

  * Added code from HAppS-Extra to fix cookie parsing problems.

  * New command-line options for --port, --debug.

  * New debug feature prints the date, the raw request, and
    the processed request data to standard output on each request.

  * Files with ".page" extension can no longer be uploaded.

  * Apostrophes and quotation marks now allowed in page names.

description: "Gitit\n=====\n\nGitit is a wiki program written in Haskell. It uses
  [Happstack] for\nthe web server and [pandoc] for markup processing. Pages and uploaded\nfiles
  are stored in a [git], [darcs], or [mercurial] repository\nand may be modified either
  by using the VCS's command-line tools or\nthrough the wiki's web interface. By default,
  pandoc's extended version\nof markdown is used as a markup language, but reStructuredText,
  LaTeX, HTML,\nDocBook, or Emacs Org-mode markup can also be used.  Gitit can\nbe
  configured to display TeX math (using [texmath]) and\nhighlighted source code (using
  [highlighting-kate]).\n\nOther features include\n\n* plugins: dynamically loaded
  page transformations written in Haskell\n  (see \"Network.Gitit.Interface\")\n\n*
  categories\n\n* TeX math\n\n* syntax highlighting of source code files and code
  snippets (using\n  highlighting-kate)\n\n* caching\n\n* Atom feeds (site-wide and
  per-page)\n\n* a library, \"Network.Gitit\", that makes it simple to include a gitit\n

  started\n===============\n\nCompiling and installing gitit\n------------------------------\n\nThe
  most reliable way to install gitit from source is to get the\n[stack] tool.  Then
  clone the gitit repository and use stack\nto install:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/jgm/gitit\n
  \   cd gitit\n    stack install\n\nAlternatively, instead of using [stack], you
  can get the\n[Haskell Platform] and do the following:\n\n    cabal update\n    cabal
  install gitit\n\nThis will install the latest released version of gitit.\nTo install
  a version of gitit checked out from the repository,\nchange to the gitit directory
  and type:\n\n    cabal install\n\nThe `cabal` tool will automatically install all
  of the required haskell\nlibraries. If all goes well, by the end of this process,
  the latest\nrelease of gitit will be installed in your local `.cabal` directory.
  You\ncan check this by trying:\n\n    gitit --version\n\nIf that doesn't work, check
  to see that `gitit` is in your local\ncabal-install executable directory (usually
  `~/.cabal/bin`). And make\nsure `~/.cabal/bin` is in your system path.\n\n[stack]:
  https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack\n[Haskell Platform]: https://www.haskell.org/platform/\n\nRunning
  gitit\n-------------\n\nTo run gitit, you'll need `git` in your system path. (Or
  `darcs` or\n`hg`, if you're using darcs or mercurial to store the wiki data.)\n\nGitit
  assumes that the page files (stored in the git repository) are\nencoded as UTF-8.
  Even page names may be UTF-8 if the file system\nsupports this. So you should make
  sure that you are using a UTF-8 locale\nwhen running gitit. (To check this, type
  `locale`.)\n\nSwitch to the directory where you want to run gitit. This should be
  a\ndirectory where you have write access, since three directories, `static`,\n`templates`,
  and `wikidata`, and two files, `gitit-users` and `gitit.log`,\nwill be created here.
  To start gitit, just type:\n\n    gitit\n\nIf all goes well, gitit will do the following:\n\n
  1.  Create a git repository, `wikidata`, and add a default front page.\n 2.  Create
  a `static` directory containing files to be treated as\n     static files by gitit.\n
  3.  Create a `templates` directory containing HStringTemplate templates\n     for
  wiki pages.\n 4.  Start a web server on port 5001.\n\nCheck that it worked: open
  a web browser and go to\n<http://localhost:5001>.\n\nYou can control the port that
  gitit runs on using the `-p` option:\n`gitit -p 4000` will start gitit on port 4000.
  Additional runtime\noptions are described by `gitit -h`.\n\nUsing gitit\n===========\n\nWiki
  links and formatting\n-------------------------\n\nFor instructions on editing pages
  and creating links, see the \"Help\" page.\n\nGitit interprets links with empty
  URLs as wikilinks. Thus, in markdown\npages, `[Front Page]()` creates an internal
  wikilink to the page `Front\nPage`. In reStructuredText pages, `` `Front Page <>`_
  `` has the same\neffect.\n\nIf you want to link to a directory listing for a subdirectory,
  use a\ntrailing slash:  `[foo/bar/]()` creates a link to the directory for\n`foo/bar`.\n\nPage
  metadata\n-------------\n\nPages may optionally begin with a metadata block.  Here
  is an example:\n\n    ---\n    format: latex+lhs\n    categories: haskell math\n
  \   toc: no\n    title: Haskell and\n      Category Theory\n    ...\n\n    \\section{Why
  Category Theory?}\n\nThe metadata block consists of a list of key-value pairs, each
  on a\nseparate line. If needed, the value can be continued on one or more\nadditional
  line, which must begin with a space. (This is illustrated by\nthe \"title\" example
  above.) The metadata block must begin with a line\n`---` and end with a line `...`
  optionally followed by one or more blank\nlines. (The metadata block is a valid
  YAML document, though not all YAML\ndocuments will be valid metadata blocks.)\n\nCurrently
  the following keys are supported:\n\nformat\n:   Overrides the default page type
  as specified in the configuration file.\n    Possible values are `markdown`, `rst`,
  `latex`, `html`, `markdown+lhs`,\n    `rst+lhs`, `latex+lhs`.  (Capitalization is
  ignored, so you can also\n    use `LaTeX`, `HTML`, etc.)  The `+lhs` variants indicate
  that the page\n    is to be interpreted as literate Haskell.  If this field is missing,\n
  \   the default page type will be used.\n\ncategories\n:   A space or comma separated
  list of categories to which the page belongs.\n\ntoc\n:   Overrides default setting
  for table-of-contents in the configuration file.\n    Values can be `yes`, `no`,
  `true`, or `false` (capitalization is ignored).\n\ntitle\n:   By default the displayed
  page title is the page name.  This metadata element\n    overrides that default.\n\nHighlighted
  source code\n-----------------------\n\nIf gitit was compiled against a version
  of pandoc that has highlighting\nsupport (see above), you can get highlighted source
  code by using\n[delimited code blocks]:\n\n    ~~~ {.haskell .numberLines}\n    qsort
  []     = []\n    qsort (x:xs) = qsort (filter (< x) xs) ++ [x] ++\n                   qsort
  (filter (>= x) xs) \n    ~~~\n\nTo see what languages your pandoc was compiled to
  highlight:\n\n    pandoc -v\n\n[delimited code blocks]: http://pandoc.org/README.html#delimited-code-blocks\n\nConfiguring
  and customizing gitit\n=================================\n\nConfiguration options\n---------------------\n\nUse
  the option `-f [filename]` to specify a configuration file:\n\n    gitit -f my.conf\n\nThe
  configuration can be split between several files:\n\n\tgitit -f my.conf -f additional.conf\n\nOne
  use case is to keep sensible part of the configuration outside of a SCM\n(oauth
  client secret for example).\n\nIf this option is not used, gitit will use a default
  configuration.\nTo get a copy of the default configuration file, which you\ncan
  customize, just type:\n\n    gitit --print-default-config > my.conf\n\nThe default
  configuration file is documented with comments throughout.\n\nThe `static` directory\n----------------------\n\nOn
  receiving a request, gitit always looks first in the `static`\ndirectory (or in
  whatever directory is specified for `static-dir` in\nthe configuration file). If
  a file corresponding to the request is\nfound there, it is served immediately. If
  the file is not found in\n`static`, gitit next looks in the `static` subdirectory
  of gitit's data\nfile (`$CABALDIR/share/gitit-x.y.z/data`). This is where default
  css,\nimages, and javascripts are stored. If the file is not found there\neither,
  gitit treats the request as a request for a wiki page or wiki\ncommand.\n\nSo, you
  can throw anything you want to be served statically (for\nexample, a `robots.txt`
  file or `favicon.ico`) in the `static`\ndirectory. You can override any of gitit's
  default css, javascript, or\nimage files by putting a file with the same relative
  path in `static`.\nNote that gitit has a default `robots.txt` file that excludes
  all\nURLs beginning with `/_`.\n\nNote:  if you set `static-dir` to be a subdirectory
  of `repository-path`,\nand then add the files in the static directory to your repository,
  you\ncan ensure that others who clone your wiki repository get these files\nas well.
  \ It will not be possible to modify these files using the web\ninterface, but they
  will be modifiable via git.\n\nUsing a VCS other than git\n--------------------------\n\nBy
  default, gitit will store wiki pages in a git repository in the\n`wikidata` directory.
  \ If you'd prefer to use darcs instead of git,\nyou need to add the following field
  to the configuration file:\n\n    repository-type: Darcs\n\nIf you'd prefer to use
  mercurial, add:\n\n    repository-type: Mercurial\n\nThis program may be called
  \"darcsit\" instead of \"gitit\" when a darcs\nbackend is used.\n\nNote:  we recommend
  that you use gitit/darcsit with darcs version\n2.3.0 or greater.  If you must use
  an older version of darcs, then\nyou need to compile the filestore library without
  the (default)\nmaxcount flag, before (re)installing gitit:\n\n    cabal install
  --reinstall filestore -f-maxcount\n    cabal install --reinstall gitit\n\nOtherwise
  you will get an error when you attempt to access your\nrepository.\n\nChanging the
  theme\n------------------\n\nTo change the look of the wiki, you can modify `custom.css`
  in\n`static/css`.\n\nTo change the look of printed pages, copy gitit's default `print.css`\nto
  `static/css` and modify it.\n\nThe logo picture can be changed by copying a new
  PNG file to\n`static/img/logo.png`. The default logo is 138x155 pixels.\n\nTo change
  the footer, modify `templates/footer.st`.\n\nFor more radical changes, you can override
  any of the default\ntemplates in `$CABALDIR/share/gitit-x.y.z/data/templates` by
  copying\nthe file into `templates`, modifying it, and restarting gitit. The \n`page.st`
  template is the master template; it includes the others. \nInterpolated variables
  are surrounded by `$`s, so `literal $` must \nbe backslash-escaped.\n\nAdding support
  for math\n-----------------------\n\nTo write math on a markdown-formatted wiki
  page, just enclose it\nin dollar signs, as in LaTeX:\n\n    Here is a formula:  $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c^2}}$\n\nYou
  can write display math by enclosing it in double dollar signs:\n\n    $$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c^2}}$$\n\nGitit
  can display TeX math in three different ways, depending on the\nsetting of `math`
  in the configuration file:\n\n1.  `mathjax` (default): Math will be rendered using
  the [MathJax] javascript.\n\n2.  `mathml`: Math will be converted to MathML using\n
  \   [texmath]. This method works with IE+mathplayer, Firefox, and\n    Opera, but
  not Safari.\n\n3.  `raw`: Math will be rendered as raw LaTeX codes.\n\n[MathJax]:
  https://www.mathjax.org/\n\nRestricting access\n------------------\n\nIf you want
  to limit account creation on your wiki, the easiest way to do this\nis to provide
  an `access-question` in your configuration file. (See the commented\ndefault configuration
  file.)  Nobody will be able to create an account without\nknowing the answer to
  the access question.\n\nAnother approach is to use HTTP authentication. (See the
  config file comments on\n`authentication-method`.)\n\nAuthentication through github\n-----------------------------\n\nIf
  you want to authenticate the user from github through oauth2, you need to\nregister
  your app with github to obtain a OAuth client secret and add the\nfollowing section
  to your configuration file:\n\n```\n[Github]\noauthclientid: 01239456789abcdef012\noauthclientsecret:
  01239456789abcdef01239456789abcdef012394\noauthcallback: http://mysite/_githubCallback\noauthoauthorizeendpoint:
  https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize\noauthaccesstokenendpoint: https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token\n##
  Uncomment if you are checking membership against an organization and change\n##
  gitit-testorg to this organization:\n# github-org: gitit-testorg\n```\n\nThe github
  authentication uses the scope `user:email`. This way, gitit gets the\nemail of the
  user, and the commit can be assigned to the right author if the\nwikidata repository
  is pushed to github. Additionally, it uses `read:org` if you\nuses the option `github-org`
  to check membership against an organization.\n\nTo push your repository to gitub
  after each commit, you can add the file\n`post-commit` with the content below in
  the .git/hooks directory of your\nwikidata repository.\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\ngit push
  origin master 2>> logit\n```\n\nPlugins\n=======\n\nPlugins are small Haskell programs
  that transform a wiki page after it\nhas been converted from Markdown or another
  source format. See the example\nplugins in the `plugins` directory. To enable a
  plugin, include the path to the\nplugin (or its module name) in the `plugins` field
  of the configuration file.\n(If the plugin name starts with `Network.Gitit.Plugin.`,
  gitit will assume that\nthe plugin is an installed module and will not look for
  a source file.)\n\nPlugin support is enabled by default. However, plugin support
  makes\nthe gitit executable considerably larger and more memory-hungry.\nIf you
  don't need plugins, you may want to compile gitit without plugin\nsupport.  To do
  this, unset the `plugins` Cabal flag:\n\n    cabal install --reinstall gitit -f-plugins\n\nNote
  also that if you compile gitit for executable profiling, attempts\nto load plugins
  will result in \"internal error: PAP object entered!\"\n\nAccessing the wiki through
  git\n==============================\n\nAll the pages and uploaded files are stored
  in a git repository. By\ndefault, this lives in the `wikidata` directory (though
  this can be\nchanged through configuration options). So you can interact with the\nwiki
  using git command line tools:\n\n    git clone ssh://my.server.edu/path/of/wiki/wikidata\n
  \   cd wikidata\n    vim Front\\ Page.page  # edit the page\n    git commit -m \"Added
  message about wiki etiquette\" Front\\ Page.page\n    git push\n\nIf you now look
  at the Front Page on the wiki, you should see your changes\nreflected there.  Note
  that the pages all have the extension `.page`.\n\nIf you are using the darcs or
  mercurial backend, the commands will\nbe slightly different.  See the documentation
  for your VCS for\ndetails.\n\nPerformance\n===========\n\nCaching\n-------\n\nBy
  default, gitit does not cache content.  If your wiki receives a lot of\ntraffic
  or contains pages that are slow to render, you may want to activate\ncaching.  To
  do this, set the configuration option `use-cache` to `yes`.\nBy default, rendered
  pages, and highlighted source files\nwill be cached in the `cache` directory. (Another
  directory can be\nspecified by setting the `cache-dir` configuration option.)\n\nCached
  pages are updated when pages are modified using the web\ninterface. They are not
  updated when pages are modified directly through\ngit or darcs. However, the cache
  can be refreshed manually by pressing\nCtrl-R when viewing a page, or by sending
  an HTTP GET or POST request to\n`/_expire/path/to/page`, where `path/to/page` is
  the name of the page to\nbe expired.\n\nUsers who frequently update pages using
  git or darcs may wish to add a\nhook to the repository that makes the appropriate
  HTTP request to expire\npages when they are updated. To facilitate such hooks, the
  gitit cabal\npackage includes an executable `expireGititCache`. Assuming you are\nrunning
  gitit at port 5001 on localhost, and the environment variable\n`CHANGED_FILES` contains
  a list of the files that have changed, you can\nexpire their cached versions using\n\n
  \   expireGititCache http://localhost:5001 $CHANGED_FILES\n\nOr you can specify
  the files directly:\n\n    expireGititCache http://localhost:5001 \"Front Page.page\"
  foo/bar/baz.c\n\nThis program will return a success status (0) if the page has been\nsuccessfully
  expired (or if it was never cached in the first place),\nand a failure status (>
  0) otherwise.\n\nThe cache is persistent through restarts of gitit.  To expire all
  cached\npages, simply remove the `cache` directory.\n\nIdle\n----\n\nBy default,
  GHC's runtime will repeatedly attempt to collect garbage\nwhen an executable like
  Gitit is idle. This means that gitit will, after\nthe first page request, never
  use 0% CPU time and sleep, but will use\n~1%. This can be bad for battery life,
  among other things.\n\nTo fix this, one can disable the idle-time GC with the runtime
  flag\n`-I0`:\n\n    gitit -f my.conf +RTS -I0 -RTS\n\n\nNote:\n\nTo enable RTS,
  cabal needs to pass the compile flag `-rtsopts` to GHC while installing.\n\n    cabal
  install --reinstall gitit --ghc-options=\"-rtsopts\"\n\nUsing gitit with apache\n=======================\n\nMost
  users who run a public-facing gitit will want gitit to appear\nat a nice URL like
  `http://wiki.mysite.com` or\n`http://mysite.com/wiki` rather than `http://mysite.com:5001`.\nThis
  can be achieved using apache's `mod_proxy`.\n\nProxying to `http://wiki.mysite.com`\n------------------------------------\n\nSet
  up your DNS so that `http://wiki.mysite.com` maps to\nyour server's IP address.
  Make sure that the `mod_proxy`, `mod_proxy_http` and `mod_rewrite` modules are\nloaded,
  and set up a virtual host with the following configuration:\n\n    <VirtualHost
  *>\n        ServerName wiki.mysite.com\n        DocumentRoot /var/www/\n        RewriteEngine
  On\n        ProxyPreserveHost On\n        ProxyRequests Off\n    \n        <Proxy
  *>\n           Order deny,allow\n           Allow from all\n        </Proxy>\n    \n
  \       ProxyPassReverse /    http://127.0.0.1:5001\n        RewriteRule ^(.*) http://127.0.0.1:5001$1
  [P]\n    \n        ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error.log\n        LogLevel warn\n
  \   \n        CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access.log combined\n        ServerSignature
  On\n    \n    </VirtualHost>\n\nReload your apache configuration and you should
  be all set.\n\nUsing nginx to achieve the same\n-------------------------------\n\nDrop
  a file called `wiki.example.com.conf` into `/etc/nginx/conf.d`\n(or where ever your
  distribution puts it).\n\n    server {\n        listen 80;\n        server_name
  wiki.example.com\n        location / {\n            proxy_pass        http://127.0.0.1:5001/;\n
  \           proxy_set_header  X-Real-IP  $remote_addr;\n            proxy_redirect
  off;\n        }\n        access_log /var/log/nginx/wiki.example.com.log main;\n
  \   }\n\nReload your nginx config and you should be all set.\n\n\nProxying to `http://mysite.com/wiki`\n------------------------------------\n\nMake
  sure the `mod_proxy`, `mod_headers`, `mod_proxy_http`,\nand `mod_proxy_html` modules
  are loaded. `mod_proxy_html`\nis an external module, which can be obtained [here]\n(http://apache.webthing.com/mod_proxy_html/).
  It rewrites URLs that\noccur in web pages. Here we will use it to rewrite gitit's
  links so that\nthey all begin with `/wiki/`.\n\nFirst, tell gitit not to compress
  pages, since `mod_proxy_html` needs\nuncompressed pages to parse. You can do this
  by setting the gitit\nconfiguration option\n\n    compress-responses: no\n\nSecond,
  modify the link in the `reset-password-message` in the\nconfiguration file:  instead
  of\n\n    http://$hostname$:$port$$resetlink$\n\nset it to\n\n    http://$hostname$/wiki$resetlink$\n\nRestart
  gitit.\n\nNow add the following lines to the apache configuration file for the\n`mysite.com`
  server:\n\n    # These commands will proxy /wiki/ to port 5001\n\n    ProxyRequests
  Off\n\n    <Proxy *>\n      Order deny,allow\n      Allow from all\n    </Proxy>\n\n
  \   ProxyPass /wiki/ http://127.0.0.1:5001/\n\n    <Location /wiki/>\n      SetOutputFilter
  \ proxy-html\n      ProxyPassReverse /\n      ProxyHTMLURLMap  /   /wiki/\n      ProxyHTMLDocType
  \"<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC '-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN' 'http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd'>\"
  XHTML\n      RequestHeader unset Accept-Encoding\n    </Location>\n\nReload your
  apache configuration and you should be set.\n\nFor further information on the use
  of `mod_proxy_http` to rewrite URLs,\nsee the [`mod_proxy_html` guide].\n\n[`mod_proxy_html`
  guide]: http://apache.webthing.com/mod_proxy_html/guide.html\n\nUsing gitit as a
  library\n========================\n\nBy importing the module `Network.Gitit`, you
  can include a gitit wiki\n(or several of them) in another happstack application.
  There are some\nsimple examples in the haddock documentation for `Network.Gitit`.\n\nReporting
  bugs\n==============\n\nBugs may be reported (and feature requests filed) at\n<https://github.com/jgm/gitit/issues>.\n\nThere
  is a mailing list for users and developers at\n<http://groups.google.com/group/gitit-discuss>.\n\nAcknowledgements\n================\n\nA
  number of people have contributed patches:\n\n- Gwern Branwen helped to optimize
  gitit and wrote the\n  InterwikiPlugin. He also helped with the Feed module.\n-
  Simon Michael contributed the patch adding RST support.\n- Henry Laxen added support
  for password resets and helped with\n  the apache proxy instructions.\n- Anton van
  Straaten made the process of page generation\n  more modular by adding Gitit.ContentTransformer.\n-
  Robin Green helped improve the plugin API and interface, and\n  fixed a security
  problem with the reset password code.\n- Thomas Hartman helped improve the index
  page, making directory\n  browsing persistent, and fixed a bug in template recompilation.\n-
  Justin Bogner improved the appearance of the preview button.\n- Kohei Ozaki contributed

  mightybyte suggested making gitit available as a library,\n  and contributed a patch
  to ifLoggedIn that was needed to\n  make gitit usable with a custom authentication
  scheme.\n\nI am especially grateful to the darcs team for using darcsit for\ntheir
  public-facing wiki.  This has helped immensely in identifying\nissues and improving
  performance.\n\nGitit's default visual layout is shamelessly borrowed from Wikipedia.\nThe
