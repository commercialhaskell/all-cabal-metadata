description: ! "# Gingersnap\n\nGingersnap's not a web framework: that's `snap-core`'s
  job.\nMore a set of lightweight idioms for building a resource-safe JSON API with\n(by
  default) `postgresql-simple`.\n\nAs it's just a set of idioms, it's easy to only
  use 'em where you need 'em.\nAn app could have only a single endpoint that uses
  Gingersnap, with the rest\nusing plain `snap` or `snap-core`.\n\nHow do we use it?
  This README is also a Literate Haskell file so it's a full\nexample you can run
  with markdown-unlit. Let's get started:\n\n## Imports at the top!\n\nA few imports
  we'll need for this tutorial:\n\n```haskell\n{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric, OverloadedStrings
  #-}\n\nimport Control.Monad (when)\nimport Data.Aeson (ToJSON, (.=), FromJSON)\nimport
  Database.PostgreSQL.Simple\n -- For our automatic JSON instance:\nimport GHC.Generics
  (Generic)\nimport Gingersnap.Core\nimport Network.HTTP.Types.Status\nimport Snap.Core\n--
  From the 'snap-server' package:\nimport Snap.Http.Server (quickHttpServe)\n```\n\n##
  A first endpoint\n\nNow that we've got our imports, let's jump into defining an
  endpoint. We'll\ndefine a little bit of setup code later on in the file.\n\n```haskell\ndata
  Character = Character { name :: String, age :: Int }\n deriving (Show, Generic)\n\ninstance
  ToJSON Character\ninstance FromJSON Character\n\none :: Ctx -> Snap ()\none ctx
  =\n   pureRsp ctx $ rspGood $ Character { name = \"Yoda\", age = 900 }\n```\n\nYou
  can run the code from this file with\n\n    $ cabal update\n    $ cabal install
  gingersnap snap-server markdown-unlit\n    $ ghci -pgmL markdown-unlit README.lhs
  \  # The \"-pgmL\" is just for this README\n\nAnd calling \"main\". In another window,
  if you call:\n\n    $ curl 'localhost:8000/one'\n\nYou should get back:\n\n    {\"result\":{\"age\":900,\"name\":\"Yoda\"}}\n\nA
  few things to notice:\n  - The endpoint takes as an argument a \"Ctx\". We'll see
  the definition of that\n    later.\n  - The endpoint returns our data with \"rspGood\".
  More on that in a moment.\n  - The response came wrapped in a \"result\" JSON object.
  You can customize that\n    behavior but we'll use the default here.\n\nSo, what's
  \"rspGood\"? Well, it has the type\n\n    rspGood :: ToJSON x => x -> Rsp\n\nThe
  \"Rsp\" type is one of the core types in Gingersnap. Keep an eye out for it later.\n\n##
  Defining \"main\"\n\nLet's now look at how we defined our main function.\n\n```haskell\nmain
  :: IO ()\nmain = do\n   ctx <- makeCtx\n   quickHttpServe $ route [\n        (\"one\",
  one ctx)\n      , (\"two\", two ctx)\n      , (\"three\", three ctx)\n      , (\"four\",
  method POST $ four ctx)\n      ]\n```\n\nOther than \"ctx\", this isn't Gingersnap-specific
  at all: just a simple\n`snap-core` server. \"makeCtx\" is a function we define ourselves.
  It creates a\nvalue of type \"Ctx\", which we define ourselves, and which is an
  instance of\n\"IsCtx\".\n\n## IsCtx\n\nThe idea of \"IsCtx\" is that it allows us
  to thread whatever data we need through\nto our endpoints. We'll definitely need
  a database connection (pool), but it's a\ntypeclass, so you can define whatever
  other fields you'd like to pass to your\nhandlers in the type that's an instance
  of that class.\n\nFor example, if you're using the 'auto-update' package to efficiently
  run\nperiodic actions (like getting the current time), you may want to create another\nset
  of fields in your \"Ctx\" type to easily thread auto-update's actions through\nto
  your handlers, too.\n\nSo let's define our own! We unimaginitavely call it \"Ctx\":\n\n```haskell\ndata
  Ctx = Ctx { ctx_db :: Pool Connection }\n\ninstance IsCtx Ctx where\n   ctxConnectionPool
  = ctx_db\n```\n\nAnd then define a simple \"makeCtx\":\n\n```haskell\nmakeCtx ::
  IO Ctx\nmakeCtx = do\n\n   -- Setting up the DB connection pool:\n   let connString
  = \" host=localhost port=5432 dbname=postgres user=postgres \"\n   pool <- createPool
  (connectPostgreSQL connString) close 1 5 20\n\n   pure $ Ctx { ctx_db = pool }\n```\n\nAnd
  that's that!\n\n## Talking to the database\n\nNow that we've got (through Ctx) a
  DB connection pool, let's query the DB:\n\n\n```haskell\ntwo :: Ctx -> Snap ()\ntwo
  ctx = do\n   inTransaction ctx $ \\conn -> do\n      [Only x] <- query_ conn \"
  SELECT 3 + 3 \"\n      pure $ rspGood $ Character { name = \"Calvin\", age = x }\n```\n\n
  \   $ curl 'localhost:8000/two'\n    {\"result\":{\"age\":6,\"name\":\"Calvin\"}}\n\nNice!
  This uses \"inTransaction\", another core tool in Gingersnap:\n\n    inTransaction
  :: IsCtx ctx => ctx -> (Connection -> IO Rsp) -> Snap ()\n\nWe've already seen IsCtx
  and Rsp, so the main thing to notice here is that the\naction we pass to inTransaction
  is passed a Connection and is in IO, not in Snap\n(or MonadSnap). This gives us
  a few nice things:\n  - If you're in Snap, you can accidentally leak a Connection
  resource by calling\n    finishWith while in the middle of a transaction or DB action.
  We don't have this\n    problem.\n  - We can choose at any time whether to commit
  or rollback. The \"Rsp\" type carries\n    information about whether to commit or
  rollback (e.g. \"rspGood\" will commit,\n    \"rspBadRollback\" won't). This is
  in contrast to \"withTransaction\", that'll\n    only roll back if there's an exception,
  and in contrast to manually beginning\n    a transaction, which provides no check
  that we properly commit or rollback\n    (e.g. we could forget to commit/rollback
  in one case among many in a complicated\n    branching expression)\n\nIf there's
  an error while running the `(Connection -> IO Rsp)` action:\n  - The transaction
  will be rolled back\n  - The `Connection` will be returned to the connection pool\n
  \ - A JSON error response will be returned. If you're defining your own `ApiErr`\n
  \   instance, that'll be `apiErr_unexpectedError`\n\n## Not everything's rspGood\n\nWhat
  if we don't want to send a successful ok200 message? Or maybe we don't even\nwant
  to commit our transaction? These might come in handy then:\n\n    rspBadCommit ::
  ApiErr ae => ae -> Rsp\n    rspBadRollback :: ApiErr ae => ae -> Rsp\n\n(`rspBad`
  is an alias for `rspBadRollback`)\n\n`ApiErr` is a simple typeclass that ensures
  our error type can be converted to\na HTTP status code and JSON value.\n\nWe don't
  need to (and won't be) exploring the `ApiErr` typeclass here directly\n, since we've
  got a good default instance with the `DefaultApiErr` type.\nIt'll make us write
  a little more (e.g. explicitly stating the status code of\nour error), but it's
  quick and easy.\n\n```haskell\nthree :: Ctx -> Snap ()\nthree ctx =\n   inTransaction
  ctx $ \\conn -> do\n      [Only n] <- query_ conn \" SELECT random () \"\n      pure
  $ if n >= (0.5 :: Double)\n         then rspGood n\n         else rspBad $\n            DefaultApiErr_Custom\n
  \              internalServerError500\n               \"'n' too small\"\n               [(\"n\"
  .= n)]\n```\n\n    $ curl -v 'localhost:8000/three'\n    [...]\n    < HTTP/1.1 200
  OK\n    [...]\n    {\"result\":0.594665706157684}\n\n    $ curl -v 'localhost:8000/three'\n
  \   [...]\n    < HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\n    [...]\n    {\"errorCode\":6,\"errorVals\":[[\"n\",0.2500847]],\"errorMessage\":\"'n'
  too small\"}\n\nIf you'd like to write your own `ApiErr` instance (which you probably
  should if\nyou're building something \"real\":\n  - The definition of \"errResult\"
  for \"DefaultApiErr\" might be a good guide\n    for how to get a consistent JSON
  result.\n  - You'll want to make that type the \"CtxErrType\" associated type for
  IsCtx\n\n## Getting JSON\n\nWe've sent a lot of JSON, but let's receive some!\n\n```haskell\nfour
  :: Ctx -> Snap ()\nfour ctx = do\n   o <- reqObject ctx\n   character <- o .! \"character\"\n
  \  amtToAge <- o .! \"amt_to_age\"\n\n   when (amtToAge < (0 :: Int)) $\n      errorEarlyCode
  $\n         DefaultApiErr_Custom unprocessableEntity422 \"Can't age backwards!\"
  []\n\n   inTransaction ctx $ \\conn -> do\n      [Only newAge] <- query conn \"
  SELECT ? + ? \" (age character, amtToAge)\n      pure $ rspGood $ character { age
  = newAge }\n```\n\n(Note with a custom `ApiErr` instance you won't have to specify
  the HTTP\nresponse like 'unprocessableEntity422' etc.)\n\n    $ curl 'localhost:8000/four'
  --data '{\"character\": {\"name\": \"Calvin\", \"age\": 6}, \"amt_to_age\": 1}'\n\n
  \   {\"result\":{\"age\":7,\"name\":\"Calvin\"}}\n\n`(.!)` requires that the value
  be present and short-circuits with a JSON error\nif it's not or if it's malformed
  (i.e. if `fromJSON` would fail)\n\n`(.!?)` doesn't require the value to be present
  - it returns a `Maybe` value. If\nthe key is present but the value is malformed,
  however, it'll return a JSON error.\n\nA few things to note:\n  - If everything's
  not okay with the JSON inputs to the function, we never even\n    make it to the
  DB.\n  - `errorEarlyCode` is like (and uses) Snap's `finishWith`, but we don't have\n
  \   to worry about a resource leak since `inTransaction` is separate\n\n## Not everything's
  JSON\n\nA JSON API is usually JSON but if you'd like to e.g. send a CSV or a file
  there\nare functions like `rspGoodCSV` and (the most general) `rspGoodLBS`.\n\nIf
  you don't see a function you need it's easy to define your own.\n\n\n## Other things
  to discover\n\nThis tutorial is a work in progress, and these'll be the next concepts
  to be\ntouched on:\n\n  - returning JSON even when throwing an error\n"
