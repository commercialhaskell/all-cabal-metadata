changelog: "github-backup (1.20200721) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Removed support
  for GITHUB_USER/GITHUB_PASSWORD since github will soon\n    remove support for http
  basic auth. Use GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN instead.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Tue,
  21 Jul 2020 23:24:03 -0400\n\ngithub-backup (1.20191219) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * Updated to use github-0.23 (0.24 needs larger changes)\n  * Various updates
  to internal git and utility libraries shared\n    with git-annex.\n  * Remove support
  for building with old versions of network-uri and network\n    before the split

  \ * Updated to use github-0.18\n  * Pull requests retreived with authentication
  again.\n  * Build with -threaded, which fixes some issues with the non-threaded\n
  \   GHC RTS.\n  * Removed dependency on MissingH, instead depending on split.\n

  (1.20160922) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Increase base bounds to 4.8 to get
  mapM_ etc that works on Vector.\n  * Recommended build method is now to use stack,
  for more reliable builds.\n  * Explicitly list modules and other files in github-backup.cabal.\n
  \ * The hackage .tar.gz now omits the debian directory and may omit other\n    source
  files in the future; the purpose of that tarball is to make\n    stack/cabal install
  work, not to be a complete source distribution.\n    Use git repository to get complete
  source.\n  * Various updates to internal git and utility libraries shared\n    with
  git-annex.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Mon, 22 Aug 2016 23:57:16 -0400\n\ngithub-backup
  (1.20160522) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Work around git weirdness in handling
  of relative path to GIT_INDEX_FILE\n    when in a subdirectory of the repository.\n
  \ * Various updates to internal git and utility libraries shared\n    with git-annex.\n
  \ * debian: Add lintian overrides for rpath.\n  * debian: Bump standards-version.\n
  \ * Makefile: Pass LDFLAGS, CFLAGS, and CPPFLAGS through ghc and on to \n    ld,
  cc, and cpp. This lets the Debian package build with various\n    hardening options.
  Although their benefit to a largely haskell program\n    is unknown.\n\n -- Joey

changelog-type: text
description: "github-backup is a simple tool you run in a git repository you cloned
  from\nGitHub. It backs up everything GitHub publishes about the repository,\nincluding
  branches, tags, other forks, issues, comments, wikis, milestones,\npull requests,
  watchers, and stars.\n\n## Installation\n\nSeveral distributions include packages
  of github-backup, for example\non Debian and Debian derived distributions it can
  easily be installed\nwith `sudo apt-get install github-backup`.\n\nTo build it from
  source, first install Haskell's\n[stack](http://haskellstack.org/) tool.\nFor example,
  on a Debian system:\n\n\tsudo apt-get install haskell-stack\n\nThen to build and
  install github-backup:\n\n\tgit clone https://git.joeyh.name/git/github-backup.git\n\tcd
  github-backup\n\tstack install\n\nThere is also a Makefile, which uses cabal to
  build, and installs\na man page, bash completion file, etc. This is recommended
  for use when\nmaking packages of github-backup.\n\n## Use\n\n  Run `github-backup`
  with no parameters, inside a git repository cloned\n  from GitHub to back up that
  repository.\n\n  Or, if you have a GitHub account, run `github-backup username`\n
  \ to clone and back up your account's repositories, as well\n  as the repositories
  you're watching and have starred.\n\n## Why backup GitHub repositories\n\nThere
  are a couple of reasons to want to back this stuff up:\n\n* In case something happens
  to GitHub. (Some may argue that this has\n  already happened.) More generally because
  keeping your data in the\n  cloud *and* relying on the cloud to back it up is foolish.\n\n*
  In case someone takes down a repository that you were interested in.\n  If you run
  github-backup with your username, it will back up all \n  the repositories you have
  watched and starred.\n\n* So you can keep working on your repository while on a
  plane, or\n  on a remote beach or mountaintop. Just like Linus intended.\n\n## What
  to expect\n\nEach time you run github-backup, it will find any new forks on GitHub.
  It\nwill add remotes to your repository for the forks, using names like\n`github_torvalds_subsurface`.
  It will fetch from every fork.\n\nIt downloads metadata from each fork. This is
  stored\ninto a branch named \"github\". Each fork gets a directory in there,\nlike
  `torvalds_subsurface`. Inside the directory there will be some\nfiles, like `torvalds_subsurface/watchers`.
  There may be further\ndirectories, like for comments: `torvalds_subsurface/comments/1`.\n\nYou
  can follow the commits to the github branch to see what information\nchanged on
  GitHub over time.\n\nThe format of the files in the github branch is currently Haskell\nserialized
  data types. This is plain text, and readable, if you squint.\n\n## Limitations\n\ngithub-backup
  is repository-focused. It does not try to back up other\ninformation from GitHub.
  In particular, social network stuff, like\nusers who are following you, is not backed
  up.\n\ngithub-backup does not log into GitHub, so it cannot backup private\nrepositories.\n\nNotes
  added to commits and lines of code don't get backed up yet.\nThere is only recently
  API support for this.\n\nThe labels that can be added to issues and milestones are
  not backed up.\nNeither are the hooks. They could be, but don't seem important\nenough
  for the extra work involved. Yell if you need them.\n\ngithub-backup re-downloads
  all issues, comments, and so on\neach time it's run. This may be slow if your repo
  has a lot of them,\nor even if it just has a lot of forks.\n\nBear in mind that
  this uses the GitHub API; don't run it every 5 minutes.\nGitHub [rate limits](http://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting)
  the\nAPI to some small number of requests per hour when used without\nauthentication.
  To avoid this limit, you can set the environment\nvariable `GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN`
  to a token obtained from \n<https://github.com/settings/tokens> and\nit will log
  in when making (most) API requests.\n\nAnyway, github-backup *does* do an incremental
  backup, picking up where it\nleft off, so will complete the backup eventually even
  if it's rate limited.\n\n## Author\n\ngithub-backup was written by Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>\n\nIt
  is made possible thanks to:\n\n* Mike Burns's [haskell github library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/github)\n*
  GitHub, for providing an API exposing this data. \n"
