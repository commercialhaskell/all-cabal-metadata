  Dec 2013 15:02:21 -0400\n\ngit-repair (1.20131122) unstable; urgency=low\n\n  *
  Added test mode, which can be used to randomly corrupt test \n    repositories,
  in reproducible ways, which allows easy\n    corruption-driven-development.\n  *
  Improve repair code in the case where the index file is corrupt,\n    and this hides
  other problems.\n  * Write a dummy .git/HEAD if the file is missing or corrupt,
  as\n    git otherwise will not treat the repository as a git repo.\n  * Improve
  fsck code to find badly corrupted objects that crash git fsck\n    before it can
  complain about them.\n  * Fixed crashes on bad file encodings.\n  * Can now run
  10000 tests (git-repair --test -n 10000 --force)\n    with 0 failures.\n\n -- Joey

  git-repair can repair various forms of damage to git repositories.

  It is a complement to git fsck, which finds problems, but does not fix
  them.

  As well as avoiding the need to rm -rf a damaged repository and re-clone,
  using git-repair can help rescue commits you've made to the damaged
  repository and not yet pushed out.
