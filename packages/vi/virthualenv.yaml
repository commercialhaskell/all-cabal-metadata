description: ! 'virthualenv is a tool (inspired by Python''s virtualenv) to create
  isolated Haskell environments.


  virthualenv is deprecated, please use the hsenv tool.


  It creates a sandboxed environment in a .virthualenv/ directory, which, when activated,

  allows you to use regular Haskell tools (ghc, ghci, ghc-pkg, cabal) to manage your
  Haskell

  code and environment. It''s possible to create an environment, that uses different
  GHC version

  than your currently installed. virthualenv is supposed to be easier to learn (and
  use) than

  similar packages (like cabal-dev or capri).


  Basic usage.


  First, choose a directory where you want to keep your sandboxed Haskell environment,

  usually a good choice is a directory containing your cabalized project (if you want
  to work

  on a few projects (perhaps an app and its dependent library), just choose any of
  them,

  it doesn''t really matter). Enter that directory:


  > cd ~/projects/foo


  Next, create your new isolated Haskell environment (this is a one time only (per
  environment) step):


  > virthualenv


  Now, every time you want to use this enviroment, you have to activate it:


  > source .virthualenv/bin/activate


  That''s it! Now it''s possible to use all regular Haskell tools like usual, but
  it won''t affect

  your global/system''s Haskell environment, and also your per-user environment (from
  ~/.cabal and

  ~/.ghc) will stay the same. All cabal-installed packages will be private to this
  environment,

  and also the external environments (global and user) will not affect it (this environment

  will only inherit very basic packages - mostly ghc and Cabal and their deps).


  When you''re done working with this environment, enter command ''deactivate'',

  or just close the current shell (with exit).


  > deactivate


  Advanced usage.


  The only advanced usage is using different GHC version. This can be useful to test
  your code

  against different GHC version (even against nightly builds).


  First, download binary distribution of GHC for your platform

  (e.g. ghc-7.0.4-i386-unknown-linux.tar.bz2), then create a new environment using
  that GHC


  > virthualenv --ghc=/path/to/ghc_something.tar.bz2


  Then, proceed (with [de]activation) as in basic case.


  Misc.


  virthualenv has been tested on i386 Linux systems, but it should work on any Posix
  platform.

  External (from tarball) GHC feature requires binary GHC distribution compiled for
  your platform,

  that can be extracted with tar and installed with "./configure --prefix=PATH; make
  install".


  For more info please consult "virthualenv --help" or the attached README file.'
