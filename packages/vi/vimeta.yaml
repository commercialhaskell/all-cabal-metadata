  # NAME

  vimeta - frontend for video metadata tagging tools

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pjones/vimeta.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pjones/vimeta)

  # SYNOPSIS

  vimeta --version

  vimeta config [*options*]

  vimeta movie [*options*] *FILE*

  vimeta tv [*options*] [*FILE*]...

  # DESCRIPTION

  Vimeta is a tool to fetch video metadata from the interwebs and update
  video files using a tagging tool.

  [TheMovieDB][] is used as the source for movie and TV series metadata.
  This means that an API key for TheMovieDB is required in order to use
  Vimeta.  Sign up for an account at TheMovieDB.com and create an API
  key.  See the *config* command for details on how to create a
  configuration file that includes your API key.

  [AtomicParsley][] is the default tagging tool used to update the
  metadata in a video file.  Any video tagging utility can be used as
  long as it can be called from the command line.  See the CONFIGURATION
  section for details on specifying a tagging tool to Vimeta.  If you
  decide to use AtomicParsley it's highly recommended that you use the
  fork maintained by `wez` at <https://bitbucket.org/wez/atomicparsley>.

  # OPTIONS

  The following command-line options are available to all of the
  commands listed in the COMMANDS section.

  `--verbose`
  :    Enable verbose output

  `-d`, `--dry-run`
  :    Don't actually do anything.  Instead, print out what would be
       done.  Automatically enables `--verbose`.

  # COMMANDS

  ## vimeta \--version

  Display the Vimeta version number and then exit.

  ## vimeta config [*options*]

  Create a configuration file for Vimeta.

  `-k`, `--key`=*STRING*
  :    The API key for TheMovieDB to record into the configuration file.

  ## vimeta movie [*options*] *FILE*

  Look up movie metadata from TheMovieDB and tag a video file.  Vimeta
  will interactively prompt for a movie name and provide a list of
  matching movies to choose from.

  `-i`, `--id`=*ID*
  :    Avoid interactive prompting by supplying a movie ID
       assigned by TheMovieDB.com.

  ## vimeta tv [*options*] [*FILE*]...

  Look up TV series metadata from TheMovieDB and tag one or more video
  files.  Episode video files can be given on the command line or
  specified using a mapping file.  See MAPPING FILES for more
  information about creating a file that maps episodes to video files.

  Vimeta will interactively prompt for a search string and then list
  matching TV series.  The starting season number and starting episode
  number should be given on the command line or they will default to 1.
  Each video file will be assigned the next episode number in the
  series.  Vimeta is smart enough to switch to the next season after the
  last episode of the specified season.

  `-s`, `--season`=*NUMBER*
  :    Specify the starting season number to tag into the episode files.
       The season number will be incremented after the last episode of a
       season is tagged.  If the season number isn't specified it will
       default to 1.

  `-e`, `--episode`=*NUMBER*
  :    Specify the staring episode number.  If not specified it defaults
       to 1.

  `-m`, `--map`=*FILE*
  :    Use *FILE* as a mapping file.  The mapping file should contain
       two columns, the first specifies the season and episode numbers
       and the second the file name for the episode video file.  See the
       MAPPING FILE section for more details about mapping files.

  `-i`, `--id`=*ID*
  :    Avoid interactive prompting by supplying a TV series ID
       assigned by TheMovieDB.com.

  # CONFIGURATION

  The Vimeta configuration file is a YAML file containing a few keys.
  You should begin by creating a default configuration file using the
  *config* command.

  ## Description of Keys

  `tmdb_key`
  :    The API key issued by TheMovieDB.

  `cmd_movie`
  :    A format string used to execute a tagging tool for movie files.
       See FORMAT STRINGS for more information.

  `cmd_tv`
  :    A format string used to execute a tagging tool for TV episode
       files.  See FORMAT STRINGS for more information.

  # FORMAT STRINGS

  ## Description

  Vimeta uses format strings to specify the command to run in order to
  tag video files, and the arguments needed to pass metadata to the
  tagging utility.  These format strings are similar to those used with
  the `printf` family of functions and utilities.

  In format stings, the percent character (`%`), followed by a single
  character, is replaced by one of the metadata attributes.  Percent
  characters are removed and do not appear in the output string.
  Therefore, if you need a literal percent character to appear in the
  output string, you should use two percent characters (`%%`).

  Format strings in Vimeta can also contain conditional parts.  These
  are introduced with the `%{` format specifier, which must be
  terminated with the `%}` format specifier.  The text and any format
  specifiers enclosed inside the opening and closing brackets are only
  injected into the output string if all of the enclosed format
  specifiers have valid values.

  As an example, not all movies have release dates.  Supplying a
  command-line flag along with a blank release date to a tagging tool
  will most likely cause a problem.  It would be best to avoid using the
  command-line flag altogether.  The following example does just this:

      somecommand %{ --release-date %Y %}

  Here, `%Y` stands in for the full release date.  If it's not present
  in the metadata then none of the text between the brackets will be
  injected into the output string.  If multiple format specifiers are
  used, all of them have to be present in the metadata for any of the
  text between the brackets to be included in the output text.

  ## Format Specifiers for Movies

  The following format specifiers are available for tagging movie files.
  Not all specifiers are guaranteed to be present.  Consider using
  conditional specifiers.

  `%Y`
  :    Full release date in XML schema notation.

  `%a`
  :    Path to a temporary file containing a movie poster image file.

  `%d`
  :    Movie description (summary text, truncated to 255 characters).

  `%f`
  :    Path to the video file to be tagged.

  `%g`
  :    Name of first listed genre.

  `%t`
  :    Movie title.

  `%y`
  :    Release year.

  ## Format Specifiers for Episodes

  The following format specifiers are available for tagging TV episode
  files.  Not all specifiers are guaranteed to be present.  Consider
  using conditional specifiers.

  `%Y`
  :    Full air date in XML schema notation.

  `%a`
  :    Path to a temporary file containing a season poster image file.

  `%d`
  :    Episode description (summary text, truncated to 255 characters).

  `%e`
  :    Episode number.

  `%f`
  :    Path to the video file to be tagged.

  `%n`
  :    Name of the TV series.

  `%s`
  :    Season number.

  `%t`
  :    Episode name.

  `%y`
  :    Year that the episode aired.

  # MAPPING FILES

  Vimeta can use mapping files that specify hints about metadata and
  which video files to tag.  For example, the *tv* command can use
  mapping files to link video files to specific season and episode
  numbers.

  Mapping files are plain text files that contain two columns separated
  by whitespace.  Comments and blank lines are ignored.  Comments begin
  with a pound sign (`#`) and continue to the end of the line.

  The first column should contain information relevant to the command
  using the mapping file.  For example, the *tv* command expects the
  first column to specify the season and episode number.

  The second column is always a file name.  If the file doesn't exist
  and the file name lacks a file extension, `.m4v` will be added to the
  file name automatically.

  Example mapping file for the *tv* command:

      # This is a comment.
      S2E3 track03.m4v  # Season 2, Episode 3
      S3E1 track01.m4v  # Season 3, Episode 1

  # EXAMPLES

  ## Tag Several Episode Files

      vimeta tv -s 3 -e 10 file01.m4v file02.m4v

  With this command, Vimeta will prompt for the name of the TV series
  and then search TheMovieDB.  It will then generate a menu where the
  correct TV series can be chosen.  Both files will be tagged as
  belonging to season 3.  The first file is episode 10 and the second
  file is episode 11.  (For more control over how season and episode
  numbers are assigned to files, see the section on MAPPING FILES.)
