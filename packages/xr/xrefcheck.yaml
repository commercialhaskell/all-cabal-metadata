  Unreleased
  ==========

  0.2.2
  ==========

  * [#145](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/145)
    + Add check that there is no unknown fields in config.
  * [#158](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/158)
    + Fixed bug when we reported footnotes as broken links
  * [#163](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/163)
    + Fixed an issue where the progress bar thread might be unexpectedly cancelled and jumble up the output.
  * [#184](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/184)
    + Make `flavor` a required parameter.
  * [#182](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/182)
    + Now we call references to anchors in current file (e.g. `[a](#b)`) as
    `current file` references instead of calling them `local` (which was ambigious).
  * [#188](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/188)
    + Added CLI option `--no-colors` that disables ANSI colors in output.
    + Automatically disable coloring if it is not supported
  * [#152](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/152)
    + Now we report links that target a file outside repository (e.g. `/../a.md`)
      as broken (with message `Link targets a local file outside repository`).
      Same for links that are using directories outside repository (e.g. `/../repo/a.md`),
      since such things are not supported by GitHub markdown renderer.
  * [#174](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/174)
    + Make xrefcheck only scan files that are tracked by git.
    + Fixed bug where links to ignored files were valid.
    + Fixed bug where links with trailing slashes were invalid.
  * [#198](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/198)
    + Now we're checking globs in config fields and CLI args (e.g. `ignored`),
      they must be valid globs relative to repository root (`foo/*` instead of `/foo/*`)
  * [#196](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/196)
    + Now `xrefcheck: ignore link` annotation expects a link to ignore in next markdown node,
      instead of expecting link in whole rest of file.
      If you've got `Expected a LINK after "ignore link" annotation` message, see
      PR's description for examples and details.

    + Fixed bug when prefixing `--ignored` and `--root` paths with `./`
  * [#85](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/pull/85)
    + Make possible to specify whether ignore localhost links, use
    `check-localhost` CLA argument (by default localhost links will not be checked).

  # Xrefcheck

  [![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/75461331a6058b334383cdfca1071dc1f908b70cf069d857b7.svg?branch=master)](https://buildkite.com/serokell/xrefcheck)

  Xrefcheck is a tool for verifying local and external references in repository documentation that is quick, easy to setup, and suitable to be added to CI.

  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5394217/70820564-06b06e00-1dea-11ea-9680-27f661ca2a58.png" alt="Output sample" width="600"/>

  ### Motivation

  As the project evolves, links in documentation have a tendency to get broken. This is usually because of:
  1. File movements;
  2. Markdown header renames;
  3. Outer sites ceasing their existence.

  This tool will help you to keep references in order.

  ### Aims

  Comparing to alternative solutions, this tool tries to achieve the following points:

  * Quickness - local references are verified instantly even for moderately-sized repositories.
  * Easy setup - no extra actions required, just run the tool in the repository root.
  Both relative and absolute local links are supported out of the box.
  * Conservative verifier allows using this tool in CI, no false positives (e.g. on sites which require authentication) should be reported.

  ### A comparison with other solutions

  * [linky](https://github.com/mattias-p/linky) - a well-configurable verifier written in Rust, scans one specified file at a time and works good in pair with system utilities like `find`.
    This tool requires some configuring before it can be applied to a repository or added to CI.
  * [awesome_bot](https://github.com/dkhamsing/awesome_bot) - a solution written in Ruby that can be easily included in CI or integrated into GitHub.
    Its features include duplicated URLs detection, specifying allowed HTTP error codes and reporting generation.
    At the moment of writing, it scans only external references and checking anchors is not possible.
  * [remark-validate-links](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-validate-links) and [remark-lint-no-dead-urls](https://github.com/davidtheclark/remark-lint-no-dead-urls) - highly configurable Javascript solution for checking local and remote links resp.
    It is able to check multiple repositores at once if they are gathered in one folder.
    Being written on JavaScript, it is fairly slow on large repositories.
  * [markdown-link-check](https://github.com/tcort/markdown-link-check) - another checker written in JavaScript, scans one specific file at a time.
    Supports `mailto:` link resolution.
  * [url-checker](https://github.com/paramt/url-checker) - GitHub action which checks links in specified files.
  * [linkcheck](https://github.com/filiph/linkcheck) - advanced site crawler, checks for `HTML` files. There are other solutions for this particular task which we don't mention here.

  At the moment of writing, the listed solutions don't support ftp/ftps links.

  ## Dependencies [↑](#xrefcheck)

  Xrefcheck requires you to have `git` version 2.18.0 or later in your PATH.

  ## Usage [↑](#xrefcheck)

  We provide the following ways for you to use xrefcheck:

  - [GitHub action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/xrefcheck)
  - [statically linked binaries](https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/releases)
  - [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/serokell/xrefcheck)
  - [building from source](#build-instructions-)

  If none of those are suitable for you, please open an issue!

  To find all broken links in a repository, run from within its folder:

  ```sh
  xrefcheck
  ```

  To also display all found links and anchors:

  ```sh
  xrefcheck -v
  ```

  For description of other options:

  ```sh
  xrefcheck --help
  ```


  ### Special functionality

  <details>
    <summary>Ignoring external links</summary>

    If you want some external links to not be verified, you can use one of the following ways to ignore those links:

  1. Add the regular expression that matches the ignoring link to the `ignoreRefs` parameter of your config file.

      For example:
      ```yaml
      ignoreRefs:
        - https://bad.reference.(org|com)(/?)
      ```
      allows to ignore both `https://bad.reference.org` and `https://bad.reference.com` with or without last "/".

  2. Add right in-place annotation using one of the following ignoring modes (each mode is just a comment with a certain syntax).

      * Ignore the link:

          There are several ways to add this annotation:

        * Just add it like a regular text before the ignoring link.

          ```markdown
          Bad ['com' reference](https://bad.reference.com) <!-- xrefcheck: ignore link --> and bad ['org' reference](https://bad.reference.org)
          ```

        * Separate the ignoring link from the annotation and the following text with single new lines.

          ```markdown
          Bad ['com' reference](https://bad.reference.com) and bad <!-- xrefcheck: ignore link -->
          ['org'](https://bad.reference.org)
          reference
          ```

          Therefore only `https://bad.reference.org` will be ignored.

        * If the ignoring link is the first in a paragraph, then the annotation can also be added before a paragraph.

          ```markdown
          <!-- xrefcheck: ignore link -->
          [Bad 'org' reference](https://bad.reference.org)
          [Bad 'com' reference](https://bad.reference.com)
          ```

          It is still the same `https://bad.reference.org` will be ignored in this case.

      * Ignore the paragraph:

          ```markdown
          <!-- xrefcheck: ignore paragraph -->
          Bad ['org' reference](https://bad.reference.org)
          Bad ['com' reference](https://bad.reference.com)

          Bad ['io' reference](https://bad.reference.io)
          ```

          In this way, `https://bad.reference.org` and `https://bad.reference.com` will be ignored and `https://bad.reference.io` will still be verified.

      * Ignore the whole file:
          ```markdown
          <!-- a comment -->
          <!-- another comment -->

          <!-- xrefcheck: ignore file -->
          ...the rest of the file...
          ```

          Using this you can ignore the whole file.
          </details>

  ## Configuring

  Configuration template (with all options explained) can be dumped with:

  ```sh
  xrefcheck dump-config -t GitHub
  ```

  Currently supported options include:
  * Timeout for checking external references;
  * List of ignored files.

  ## Build instructions [↑](#xrefcheck)

  Run `stack install` to build everything and install the executable.
  If you want to use cabal, you need to run (`stack2cabal`)[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stack2cabal] first!

  ### CI and nix [↑](#xrefcheck)

  To build only the executables, run `nix-build`. You can use this line on your CI to use xrefcheck:
  ```
  nix run -f https://github.com/serokell/xrefcheck/archive/master.tar.gz -c xrefcheck
  ```

  Our CI uses `nix-build xrefcheck.nix` to build the whole project, including tests and Haddock.
  It is based on the [`haskell.nix`](https://input-output-hk.github.io/haskell.nix/) project.
  You can do that too if you wish.

  ## For further work [↑](#xrefcheck)

  - [ ] Support for non-Unix systems.
  - [ ] Support link detection in different languages, not only Markdown.
    - [ ] Haskell Haddock is first in turn.

  ## Issue tracker [↑](#xrefcheck)

  We use GitHub issues as our issue tracker.
  You can login using your GitHub account to leave a comment or create a new issue.
