  A little package containing code for expanding URI Templates wrt an
  input environment map. The URI template syntax is that of the draft
  IETF RFC that Joe Gregorio is driving forward:

     http://bitworking.org/projects/

  simple and useful (a combo to strive for :-) ) It is is used in a
  couple of feed-related projects already (e.g., FIQL), and WADL. More
  to come, mb.

  The expansion code also recognizes OpenSearch-1.1 style templates
  (e.g., '?' suffixes and its NS-prefix expansion forms.)
