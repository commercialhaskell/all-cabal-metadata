  ## Executive Summary

  This package contains some simple time-based tools, and consists of
  two parts: a library, and an executable.  The library should be fairly
  portable, and provides some simple timer/stopwatch functionality.  The
  executanle is a simple console-based program built on top of the
  [brick](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/brick) package, and as
  such, will presently only work on POSIX-compatible systems (sorry
  Windows users).

  ## Library

  The library provides its functionalty through the `Data.Time.Utils`
  module, and is thoroughlly documented [on
  Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/timeutils).

  ## Executable

  This package provides the `timeutils` executable, a console-based
  program with a rudimentary user interface.  It has two modes:
  stopwatch and countdown.  You can toggle between these modes by
  pressing the `<tab>` key. The program can be exited with the `<esc>`
  key, the `q` key, or by hitting `<ctrl-c>`.

  ### Stopwatch Mode

  The following is a list of keys and their effects in stopwatch mode:

  Key | Effect
  --- | ------
  `<space>` | start/stop stopwatch
  `l` | start new lap
  `r` | reset stopwatch

  ### Countdown Mode

  The following is a list of keys and their effects in countdown mode:

  Key | Effect
  --- | ------
  `n` | new countdown
  `<up>`/`<down>` | select countdown
  `<space>` | start/stop selected countdown
  `<del>` | delete selected countdown
  `r` | reset selected countdown
  `R` | delete all countdowns
  `d`/`D` | increment/deincrement days in current countdown
  `h`/`H` | increment/deincrement hours in current countdown
  `m`/`M` | increment/deincrement minutes in current countdown
  `s`/`S` | increment/deincrement seconds in current countdown
