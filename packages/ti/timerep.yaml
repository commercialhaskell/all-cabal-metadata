  =======

  This started out as a simple project to parse and display time according to
  [RFC 3339](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339), but with time gained ability
  to convert to and from other RFCs as well.

  You will find a change log in `CHANGES.md`.


  ### Todos

  - Get rid of the `formatTime` function, and use a more decent pretty
    printing lib.
  - Do some proper parsing (it parses nicely, but this was just a quick hack
    that my mind produced while being stressed to finish this).
