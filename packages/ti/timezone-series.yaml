  # timezone-series

  On Hackage: [timezone-series](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/timezone-series)

  This package endows `Data.Time`, from the time package, with several
  additional data types for enhanced processing of timezones.

  A `TimeZoneSeries` represents a timezone. It describes the timezone with
  a set of `Data.Time.TimeZone` objects, each describing the clock setting
  in the timezone for a specific period of history during which the
  clocks do not change.  The `TimeZoneSeries` as a whole describes what
  clock setting was in effect in the timezone at any given time during
  the period it covers.

  A `ZoneSeriesTime` is a moment in time within a specific timezone.  It
  is different than a `Data.Time.ZonedTime` in that a `ZonedTime` specifies
  a moment in time for a specific way that the clocks were set in a
  timezone. It is the responsibilty of the creator of a `ZonedTime` to
  verify that given clock setting was actually in effect at the given
  moment in time. A `ZonedTime` for one moment in time cannot be used
  reliably on its own to create another `ZonedTime` for a different moment
  in the same timezone - information is needed about what clock setting
  was in effect in the timezone at the new moment.

  This package also provides variants for the functions in Data.Time
  that convert between UTC time and local time. These variants take
  a `TimeZoneSeries`, representing a timezone, not just a specific
  clock setting with the timezone, so the correctness of their results
  does not depend on independent knowledge of what clock setting
  was in effect at the given time.

  Most operating systems provide information about timezone series for
  the local timezone and for many other timezones of the world.  On MS
  Windows systems, this information can be read from the registry. On
  other systems, this information is typically provided in the form of
  Olson timezone files: `/etc/localtime` (or some other file) for the
  local timezone, and files located in `/usr/share/zoneinfo/` or
  `/etc/zoneinfo/` (or some other directory) for other timezones.

  and
  [timezone-olson-th](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/timezone-olson-th)
  packages for more information about reading and creating Olson
  timezone files.
