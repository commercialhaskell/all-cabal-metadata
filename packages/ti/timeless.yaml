  # Warning
  Don't use timeless before I fix the memory leak! Also, I found that Arrows seem to work a bit differently than I thought, and there are some mysterious delays causing my state to be non transparent. Before fixing those, Timeless is not usable!


  # Introduction

  ## Timeless and Netwire

  After version 1, the only common code between `timeless` and `netwire` is the typeclass part. I greatly simplified and purefied the entire Signal class, and hopefully make it much easier to reason about, while keeping all nice properties and syntax about Arrow.


  ## What is Timeless? (do a `s/is/will be/g` in your head, for now)

  `Timeless` is an Arrow based Functional Reactive Programming framework which supports continuous-time and discrete time semantics, and allows the use of Arrow syntax.

  # Tutorial

  Look at the package [timeless-tutorials](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/timeless-tutorials). It is just started by me, and should expand later.
