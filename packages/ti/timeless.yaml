  ## Timeless and Netwire


  Although the following paragraph is valid for the original fork, it no longer holds
  for `timeless >= 1.0.0`. After this version, the only common code between `timeless`
  and `netwire` is the typeclass part. I greatly simplified and purefied the entire
  Signal class, and hopefully make it much easier to reason about, while keeping all
  nice properties and syntax about Arrow.


  <del>

  `Timeless` is a rewrite on the [`netwire-5.0.1`](http://hub.darcs.net/ertes/netwire)
  library, intending to create a simpler interface for easy FRP(Functional Reactive
  Programming) construction. The core module, `FRP.Timeless.Signal`, `FRP.Timeless.Session`,
  and `FRP.Timeless.Run` are mostly taken from Netwire, except that the `Wire s e
  m a b` is simplified to `Signal s m a b`, and several instances (such as `Profuctor`)
  are stripped away (I have to admit that I don''t understand them, so I don''t add
  them until they are REALLY needed). Everything else will be rewritten from scratch,
  based on my other project, namely `timeless-RPG`, which tries to create a complete
  RPG game engine framework (For real, this time! Hopefully it will not be abandoned
  like... well, the python one, the SFML/C++ one, the Ruby one, the second SFML/C++
  one, the python one again... you name it) based on SDL2.


  The motivation to rewrite `netwire` as `timeless` is because `netwire` lacks proper
  documentation, and its `5.*` version is quite incomplete comparing to `4.*`. At
  the same time, it doesn''t seem to be actively developed anymore, so I decide to
  write most if not all necessary things from scratch to gain a better understanding
  on, well, everything.


  Please do not expect this library to finish before t → ∞. I can only hope that I
  will not abandon this project like the other ones that I did. I would really like
  to keep the repo private until I make it rock solid (so that I am less likely to
  lose motivation due to false satisfaction), but I fear that my hard drive may crash
  some time in the future (which it just did for my other computer), so I push the
  repo up now.

  </del>


  ## What is Timeless? (do a `s/is/will be/g` in your head, for now)


  `Timeless` is an Arrow based Functional Reactive Programming framework which supports
  continuous-time semantics. Discrete time events are simulated by "impulse functions".
  It supports dynamic switching and inhibition. Signals include pure, stateful, and
  Kleisli functions, which should give a wide range of applications.



  # Tutorial


  Read the `FRP.Timeless.Tutorial` module, which is written in Literate Haskell. It
  is a very detailed implementation example of a simple interactive program.
