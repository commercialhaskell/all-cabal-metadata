  # timezone-olson

  On Hackage: [timezone-olson](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/timezone-olson)

  This package provides a parser and renderer for binary Olson timezone
  files whose format is specified in RFC 8536.

  Functions are provided for
  converting the parsed data into `TimeZoneSeries` objects from the
  [timezone-series](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/timezone-series)
  package. On many platforms, binary Olson timezone
  files suitable for use with this package are available in the
  directory `/usr/share/zoneinfo` and its subdirectories on your computer.

  See also the
  [timezone-olson-th](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/timezone-olson-th)
  package for a way to include timezone informaton from a binary Olson
  timezone file at compile time.

  ## Testing utilities

  This package also provides two Haskell files, each of which can be
  compiled into a command-line utility that might be helpful for testing
  purposes.

  zhdump.hs: A clone of zdump(8), including most of its bugs, that
             is usually present on systems that have an Olson timezone
             database, except hzdump takes paths to timezone files
             instead of timezone identifiers on the command line.

  catTZ:     Read and parse a timezone file, then render it. With the
             -i flag, interprets the timezone data as a TimeZoneSeries
             object before rendering.
