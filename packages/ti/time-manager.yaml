  # ChangeLog for time-manager

  ## 0.3.1.1

  * Added `README.md` file and improved documentation of modules and functions.
    [#1057](https://github.com/yesodweb/wai/pull/1057)

  ## 0.3.1

  BUGFIXES:

  * [#1055](https://github.com/yesodweb/wai/pull/1055)
    * `resume` now acts as a `tickle` if the `Handle` isn't paused.
      This is the same behaviour as before version `0.3.0`.
    * `registerKillThread` now throws the `TimeoutThread` in a separate
      thread, so as to not block the GHC's System TimerManager.
      This does mean that `TimeoutThread` exceptions could technically
      be thrown "out of order", but they will be more prompt.


  ## 0.3.0

  * [#1048](https://github.com/yesodweb/wai/pull/1048)
    * New architecture. The backend is switched from the designated thread
      to GHC's System TimerManager. From this version, this library is
      just wrapper APIs of GHC's System TimerManager. Unlike v0.2 or
      earlier, callbacks are executed at the exact time. System
      TimerManager uses a PSQ (a tree) while v0.2 or earlier uses a list.
      So, this version hopefully scales better.
    * Deprecated functions: `stopManager`, `killManager` and `withManager'`.
    * `tickle` sets the specified timeout from now.
    * `pause` is now identical to `cancel`.
    * `resume` is now re-registration of timeout.
    * The signature of `withHandle` is changed.

  ## 0.2.4

  * Providing `isAllGone`.
  * Providing emptyHandle.

  ## 0.2.3

  * Exporting defaultManager.

  ## 0.2.2

  * `initialize` with non positive integer creates a time manager
    which does not maintain timeout.
    [#1017](https://github.com/yesodweb/wai/pull/1017)

  ## 0.2.1

  * Export KilledByThreadManager exception
    [#1016](https://github.com/yesodweb/wai/pull/1016)

  ## 0.2.0

  * Providing `System.ThreadManager`.
  * `withHandle` catches `TimeoutThread` internally.
    It returns `Nothing` on timeout.

  ## 0.1.3

  * Providing `withHandle` and `withHandleKillThread`.

  ## 0.1.2

  * Holding `Weak ThreadId` to prevent thread leak again
    [#1013](https://github.com/yesodweb/wai/pull/1013)

  ## 0.1.1

  * Removing `unliftio`.

  ## 0.1.0

  * [#986](https://github.com/yesodweb/wai/pull/986)
      * Change behavior of `cancel` to immediately remove the `Handle` from the
      reaper's workload, rather than waiting for timeout.
      * Using auto-update v0.2.0.

  ## time-manager

  This package provides module to let you run actions with resettable timeouts
  (i.e. `System.TimeManager`) and run actions that will make sure that all
  threads forked with the given `ThreadManager` will be killed when the action
  finishes.

  ## WARNINGS

  Since version `0.3.0`, **the timeout manager relies on GHC internals**.
  This change also means that using **this package only works with the threaded**
  **runtime**. The moment a timeout is registered on a non-threaded runtime, an
  exception will be thrown.
