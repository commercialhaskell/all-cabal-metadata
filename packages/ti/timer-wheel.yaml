  # Changelog

  All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

  The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
  and this project adheres to the [Haskell Package Versioning Policy](https://pvp.haskell.org/).

  ## [0.2.0.1] - 2019-05-19

  ### Changed
  - Swapped out `ghc-prim` and `primitive` for `vector`

  ## [0.2.0] - 2019-02-03

  ### Added
  - `destroy` function, for reaping the background thread
  - `recurring_` function

  ### Changed
  - If the timer wheel reaper thread crashes, it will propagate the exception to
  the thread that spawned it
  - `new` may now throw `InvalidTimerWheelConfig`
  - The cancel action returned by `register` is now memoized, which fixes a bug
  involving trying to cancel a `recurring` timer twice. The second call used to
  spin forever and peg a CPU
  - Use `Config` type for creating a timer wheel
  - Change argument order around
  - Rename `new` to `create`
  - Make recurring timers more accurate

  ## [0.1.0] - 2018-07-18

description: |-
  This library provides a timer wheel data structure for

  * /O(1)/ registering @IO@ actions to fire after a given amount of time
  * /O(1)/ canceling registered actions

  It is similar to @TimerManager@ from "GHC.Event", but can scale much better
  under concurrent access patterns.

  An unreleased version of this library has a @backpack@-based signature for
  selecting from a variety of different data structures used internally.
  However, until @backpack@ has broader support on Hackage, and in Haddocks,
  etc, I decided to just hard-code something decent (a priority search queue).
  This makes the @O(1)@ claims above a bit of a lie, as these rely on using a
  linked list data structure internally.
