changelog: |
  ## [0.4.0.1] - 2022-11-05

  - Fix inaccurate haddock on `recurring`

  ## [0.4.0] - 2022-11-05

  - Add `create`
  - Rename `Data.TimerWheel` to `TimerWheel`
  - Swap out `vector` for `array`
  - Treat negative delays as 0
  - Drop support for GHC < 8.6

  ## [0.3.0] - 2020-06-18

  - Add `with`
  - Add support for GHC 8.8, GHC 8.10
  - Change type of `spokes` from `Natural` to `Int`
  - Change order of delay and action arguments in `register`, `register_`, `recurring`, and `recurring_`
  - Simplify `cancel` to return `True` at most once
  - Throw an error if a negative delay is provided to `register`, `register_`, `recurring`, or `recurring_`
  - Fix underflow bug that affected recurring timers
  - Remove `create`, `destroy`
  - Remove `TimerWheelDied` exception. `with` now simply re-throws the exception that the timer wheel thread throws
  - Remove `InvalidTimerWheelConfig` exception. `error` is used instead
  - Remove support for GHC < 8.6

  ## [0.2.0.1] - 2019-05-19

  - Swap out `ghc-prim` and `primitive` for `vector`

  ## [0.2.0] - 2019-02-03

  - Add `destroy` function, for reaping the background thread
  - Add `recurring_` function
  - If the timer wheel reaper thread crashes, it will propagate the exception to
  the thread that spawned it
  - `new` may now throw `InvalidTimerWheelConfig`
  - The cancel action returned by `register` is now memoized, which fixes a bug
  involving trying to cancel a `recurring` timer twice. The second call used to
  spin forever and peg a CPU
  - Use `Config` type for creating a timer wheel
  - Change argument order around
  - Rename `new` to `create`
  - Make recurring timers more accurate
