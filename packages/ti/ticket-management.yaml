  # Ticket Management

  A basic ticket management system for personal work. Here is the latest usage info:

  ```
  Ticket Manager!

  Usage: ticket-manager COMMAND
    Allows the user to manage work tickets.

  Available commands:
    create                   Creates a new ticket
    edit                     Edits the name, description, and/or status of an
                             existing ticket
    relate                   Relates two tickets to each other
    unrelate                 Removes the relationship between two tickets
    query                    Search for tickets
    init                     Initializes an empty ticket system
    tag                      Applies some tags to tickets
    validate                 Validate the ticket system
  ```

  Of special note is the help text for the query command:

  ```
  Usage: ticket-manager query [(-n|--name ARG) | (-x|--tag ARG) | (-i|--id ARG) |
                                (-s|--status ARG) | (-b|--blocks ARG) |
                                (-s|--subsumes ARG) | (-p|--blocked-by ARG) |
                                (-k|--subsumed-by ARG)] [-o|--ordering ARG]
                              [-l|--limit ARG]
    Search for tickets
  ```

  This tool allows you to create tickets, specify relationships between them, tag them,
  and then query them. To get all of the tickets you've tagged epic-1 and backend which
  are not yet in progress, you can run the following:

  ```bash
  ticket-manager query --tag epic-1 --tag backend --status todo
  ```

  You can run instead:

  ```bash
  ticket-manager query -x epic-1 -x backend -s todo
  ```

  To create a ticket, we can run:
  ```bash
  ticket-manager create my_first_ticket --name "The Best Ticket" --description "This ticket truly is the best" --status todo
  ```

  You can run instead:
  ```bash
  ticket-manager create my_first_ticket -n "The Best Ticket" -d "This ticket truly is the best" -s todo
  ```

  With every command there is an associated `--help` command which I hope will help you learn how to use the rest of the commands.

  PRs and feedback is welcome, though I am aware this tool is missing several notable features that
  today's ticket management systems have like dates, assignment, and lots of other things. These
  things are left out on purpose, as it is meant to be a simplified version for individuals to use,
  most notably myself.
