synopsis: Pattern language for improvised music
changelog: ! "# TidalCycles log of changes\n\n## 0.9.7\n\n### Enhancements\n\n* The
  `note` pattern parameter is no longer an alias for `midinote`,\n  but an independent
  parameter for supercollider to handle (in a manner\n  similar to `up`)\n  \n## 0.9.6\n\n###
  Enhancements\n\n* Added `chord` for chord patterns and `scaleP` for scale patterns\n*
  The `n` pattern parameter is now floating point\n\n## 0.9.5\n\n### Enhancements\n\n*
  Added `hurry` which both speeds up the sound and the pattern by the given amount.\n*
  Added `stripe` which repeats a pattern a given number of times per\n  cycle, with
  random but contiguous durations.\n* Added continuous function `cosine`\n* Turned
  more pattern transformation parameters into patterns - spread', striateX, every',
  inside, outside, swing\n* Added experimental datatype for Xenakis sieves\n* Correctly
  parse negative rationals\n* Added `breakUp` that finds events that share the same
  timespan, and spreads them out during that timespan, so for example (breakUp \"[bd,sn]\")
  gets turned into the \"bd sn\"\n* Added `fill` which 'fills in' gaps in one pattern
  with events from another. \n\n## 0.9.4\n\n### Fixes\n\n* Swapped `-` for `..` in
  ranges as quick fix for issue with parsing negative numbers\n* Removed overloaded
  list thingie for now, unsure whether it's worth the dependency\n\n## 0.9.3\n\n###
  Enhancements\n\n* The sequence parser can now expand ranges, e.g. `\"0-3 4-2\"`
  is\n  equivalent to `\"[0 1 2 3] [4 3 2]\"`\n* Sequences can now be described using
  list syntax, for example `sound [\"bd\", \"sn\"]` is equivalent to `sound \"bd sn\"`.
  They *aren't* lists though, so you can't for example do `sound ([\"bd\", \"sn\"]
  ++ [\"arpy\", \"cp\"])` -- but can do `sound (append [\"bd\", \"sn\"]  [\"arpy\",
  \"cp\"])`\n* New function `linger`, e.g. `linger (1/4)` will only play the first
  quarter of the given pattern, four times to fill the cycle. \n* `discretise` now
  takes time value as its first parameter, not a pattern of time, which was causing
  problems and needs some careful thought.\n* a `rel` alias for the `release` parameter,
  to match the `att` alias for `attack`\n* `_fast` alias for `_density`\n* The start
  of automatic testing for a holy bug-free future\n\n### Fixes\n\n* Fixed bug that
  was causing events to double up or get lost,\n  e.g. where `rev` was combined with
  certain other functions.\n"
