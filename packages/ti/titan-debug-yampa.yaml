description: |-
  Yampa debugger that allows you to run an FRP program and control its
  execution.

  TITAN (Testing Infrastructure for Temporal AbstractioNs) is a framework to
  test and debug FRP programs. It allows you to write temporal unit tests, check
  them, QuickCheck them, run FRP programs with a fine-tuned debugger, obtain
  information to replicate tests, and follow and control the execution of a
  Yampa program from an interactive GUI.

  This library provides a replacement function for Yampa's standard simulation
  function (@reactimate@), enabling debugging.

  It also provides a definition of the standard communication interface with
  the debugging GUI, and a default implementation of a communication bridge
  suitable for standalone desktop applications using TCP sockets.
