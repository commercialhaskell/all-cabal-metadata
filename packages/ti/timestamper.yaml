  # timestamper

  This is a stupid little tool that just reads text from the input, and
  emits it to standard output.

  ## Building and installing

  You need cabal and a Haskell compiler (e.g. GHC) installed. Then,
  clone this into some directory, `cd` into it, and run

  ```
  $ cabal configure
  $ cabal build
  $ cabal install
  ```

  ## Usage

  Pipe stuff into it. Watch it spit out timestamped lines. Be amazed.

  ## License

  See the LICENSE file.
