  # Changelog for `math-programming-glpk`

  ## [0.5.0] -- 18 January 2023

  ### Changed

  - Make the `Glpk` monad work with threaded runtimes. The underlying
    library requires that GLPK environments be accessed from a single
    thread, so we run the monad in bound threads.

  ## [0.4.1] -- 5 July 2020

  ### Fixed

  - Infeasible problems now produce an `Infeasible` status rather than
    an `Error` status.

  ## [0.4.0] -- 5 July 2020

  ### Changed

  - Updated to the `math-programming-0.4.0` API.

  ### Fixed

  - How variable bounds are set.

    Free variables were being constrained to equal zero; they are now
    correctly set as free variables.

  ### Added

  - The `writeFormulation` function.

    This replaces the `writeFormulation` class method.

  ### Removed

  - The `writeFormulation` class method.

    This is consistent with the `math-programming-0.4.0` API.

  ## [0.3.0] -- 18 June 2020

  Initial release.
