synopsis: Terminal client for the Mattermost chat system
changelog: ! "\n40901.0.0\n=========\n\nNew features:\n * Improved logging infrastructure.
  Matterhorn now keeps a running\n   bounded internal buffer of log messages that
  can be written to disk\n   at any time, in addition to supporting the usual mode
  where all\n   messages are logged to a file. This feature includes:\n   * Four new
  commands:\n     * `/log-status`: check on whether Matterhorn is currently logging\n
  \      at all.\n     * `/log-start <path>`: start logging to the specified file.\n
  \    * `/log-stop`: stop any active logging.\n     * `/log-snapshot <path>`: dump
  the internal log message buffer to\n       the specified file.\n   * A new optional
  configuration setting, `logMaxBufferSize`, which is\n     the number of entries
  in the internal log buffer.\n * Added a new message selection mode keybinding to
  view individual\n   messages (default: `v`, keybinding name: `view-message`). This\n
  \  keybinding causes the selected message to be displayed alone in a\n   pop-up
  window in which horizontal and vertical scrolling can be used\n   to view the entire
  message. This is especially useful in cases where\n   a message contains a code
  block with lines that could not be wrapped.\n   (#377)\n * Message selection mode
  now supports selection of error and info\n   messages in addition to just user posts.\n
  * Message selection mode now supports yanking the contents of all\n   messages,
  not just messages with verbatim content as before. The\n   keybinding name for this
  is `yank-whole-message` and defaults to `Y`.\n   When this binding is used, the
  entire message's Markdown source is\n   copied to the system clipboard. (#171)\n\nOther
  changes:\n * The help screen now supports the `scroll-top` and `scroll-bottom`\n
  \  events (defaulting to the `Home` and `End` keys, respectively).\n * Exceptions
  related to spurious network problems with `getAddrInfo` no\n   longer cause client
  error reports (#391).\n\n40900.0.1\n=========\n\nBug fixes:\n * Terminal escapes
  are now sanitized from local user input and\n   user-provided values from the server
  (#390).\n * The Cabal package now includes XML syntax and DTD files in the\n   manifest.\n
  * Releases now ship the syntax DTD.\n\n40900.0.0\n=========\n\nThis release supports
  Mattermost server version 4.9.\n\nNew features:\n * Matterhorn now supports activity
  notifications by invoking a\n   user-configured external command. The external command
  is configured\n   with the `activityNotifyCommand` setting. Matterhorn also includes\n
  \  an example notification script for Linux-based systems in the\n   `notification-scripts`
  directory. Thanks to Jason Miller for this\n   feature!\n * Matterhorn now bundles
  syntax highlighting language descriptions\n   rather compiling them into the binary.
  This resolves issue #372.\n   The XML descriptions are in the Kate project's language
  description\n   format and are provided with their accompanying GPL license.\n   Syntax
  description files are loaded from a prioritized list\n   of directories. The list
  of directories is configurable using\n   the optional `syntaxDirectories` configuration
  setting. See\n   `sample_config.ini` for details.\n * Matterhorn now tab-completes
  available syntax highlighting language\n   options on lines starting with the code
  block Markdown syntax (three\n   backticks) (#354).\n\nOther changes:\n * Tab-completion
  now always fills in user sigil on username and\n   nickname completions, and fills
  in channel sigils on channel name\n   completions.\n * Usernames in posts are now
  only highlighted when a user sigil is\n   present.\n\nBug fixes:\n * Matterhorn
  now switches to a channel after it has been joined (#355).\n * Fixed emote editing
  (#388).\n\n40800.0.3\n=========\n\nBug fixes:\n * Fixed a bug that prevented DM
  channel changes when the DM channels\n   were named with user nicknames (#384)\n
  * \"Resource vanished\" exceptions will no longer be silenced during\n   async work.\n\n40800.0.2\n=========\n\nBug
  fixes:\n * Matterhorn now properly handles servers with users whose usernames\n
  \  match existing channel names.\n * The flagged post list now ignores flagged posts
  from channels of\n   which the current user is no longer a member.\n * Tab-completion
  now supports nickname completion in the presence of\n   user sigils (relevant to
  #382).\n * The `/search` command now copes better with an empty string as input\n
  \  (#359).\n * The `group-msg` command now switches to the relevant channel if it\n
  \  already exists (#367).\n\nOther changes:\n * Message edits no longer cause channels
  to appear to have unread\n   activity.\n * The Haskell runtime's idle garbage collector
  was disabled, reducing\n   Matterhorn's idle CPU usage from 2-4% on some systems
  to zero.\n\n40800.0.1\n=========\n\nBug fixes:\n * User list overlays shown by `/msg`,
  `/add-user`, and `/members`\n   restrict results to the current team only.\n * Message
  posts, channel view events, and channel metadata update\n   events destined for
  other teams are now properly ignored by\n   Matterhorn if the team for those events
  doesn't match the current\n   session's team.\n\n40800.0.0\n=========\n\nThis release
  supports Mattermost server version 4.8.\n\nNew features:\n * Matterhorn now uses
  a connection pool with persistent server\n   connections for improved performance
  (thanks to Abhinav Sarkar)\n * Matterhorn now honors the server-side user preference
  about whether\n   join/leave messages should be shown or hidden.\n * Matterhorn
  now honors the server-side configuration setting that\n   determines whether users
  are displayed by nickname if possible\n   (thanks to Kelly McLaughlin)\n\nNew configuration
  settings:\n * The \"hyperlinkURLs\" setting controls whether Matterhorn emits\n
  \  hyperlinking escape sequences. It defaults to on, but can be disabled\n   for
  users using terminal emulators that do not handle such escapes\n   gracefully when
  they don't support hyperlinking (see #374)\n\nBug fixes:\n * On (re-)connection,
  Matterhorn now fetches all users rather than just\n   the first few hundred.\n\n40700.0.0\n=========\n\nThis
  release supports Mattermost server version 4.7.\n\nNew features:\n * The `/focus`
  command with no arguments now starts channel selection\n   mode, equivalent to the
  default binding of `C-g`.\n * The `/join` command now accepts an optional channel
  name argument. If\n   provided, the named channel is joined (#361).\n * A new user
  browser was added! The user browser presents a list of\n   users and the ability
  to search users by name. The new user list\n   powers some new and existing commands:\n
  \  * A new `/msg` command is used to browse known users and select a\n     user
  with `Enter` to begin a private chat session with the selected\n     user.\n   *
  A new `/add-user` command is used to add users to the current\n     channel. The
  list shows users who are not already members of the\n     channelcurrent and `Enter`
  adds the selected user to the channel.\n   * The existing `/members` command now
  shows a browsable user list of\n     members of the current channel. `Enter` begins
  a private chat\n     session with the selected user.\n\nBug fixes:\n * Missing `urlOpenCommand`s
  are now reported as error messages rather\n   than informative messages.\n * More
  login-related exceptions are now displayed in a more readable\n   format on the
  login screen (#358).\n * Channel selection mode now prefers an exact match as the
  initial\n   cursor selection if one exists (#356).\n * Replies now indicate the
  correct parent message in the message list.\n * The multi-line editor help message
  now shows the active binding\n   (previously `M-e`).\n\n40600.1.0\n=========\n\nPerformance
  improvements:\n * Matterhorn's reconnection handling was improved to more reliably\n
  \  fetch messages that arrived while the client was disconnected.\n * Startup performance
  was improved by reducing redundant post and user\n   metadata fetches when loading
  channel messages.\n\nOther fixes:\n * The multi-line toggle help message now shows
  the active binding.\n * Slash commands now support multi-line input. Previously
  only the\n   first line was passed as the command input.\n * Matterhorn now updates
  channel view status on updates from other\n   clients (#342)\n\n40600.0.0\n=========\n\nThis
  release supports Mattermost server version 4.6.\n\nNew features:\n * Rebindable
  keys are now supported! See `/help keybindings` for\n   details. Matterhorn also
  checks for conflicting bindings on startup.\n * The user status list now supports
  the Do Not Disturb status (shown as\n   `×`).\n * User typing notifications are
  now supported. These are off by default\n   but can be enabled with the `showTypingIndicator`
  configuration\n   setting. Enabling the feature causes Matterhorn to produce such\n
  \  notifications for the server and to display typing indications from\n   other
  users. Thanks to Abhinav Sarkar for this feature!\n * Matterhorn now remembers which
  channel was visited when the client is\n   closed and returns to that channel on
  startup. Thanks to Abhinav\n   Sarkar for this feature!\n\nNew commands:\n * `/message-preview`
  now toggles message preview mode in addition to\n   default `M-p` keybinding.\n\nBug
  fixes:\n * New post reactions no longer cause a post to be indicated as\n   \"(edited)\"
  (#333)\n\nUI changes:\n * The channel list shown by `/join` now also displays the
  channel\n   purpose for each channel when possible.\n\nPerformance improvements:\n
  * Matterhorn now has much lower input latency on servers with very\n   large numbers
  of users due to user list rendering performance\n   improvements.\n\nMiscellaneous:\n
  * This release now uses only version 4 API endpoints, consistent with\n   the upstream
  deprecation of version 3 API endpoints in the 4.6\n   release.\n * Startup requests
  are now performed concurrently to improve\n   performance (#347, thanks to Abhinav
  Sarkar)\n * Channel header strings containing newlines are now rendered more\n   effectively:
  newlines are converted to spaces. This behavior more\n   closely matches the web
  client, too.\n\n40400.0.0\n=========\n\nThis release supports server version 4.4.\n\nNew
  features:\n * The active color theme can be customized by creating a theme\n   customization
  file and setting the new `themeCustomizationFile`\n   option. This setting lets
  you override any foreground color,\n   background color, or style of any aspect
  of the Matterhorn interface.\n   For details on the format of the customization
  file, please see the\n   \"Themes\" help in Matterhorn with the `/help themes` command.\n
  * Edited posts are now displayed with a trailling \"edited\"\n   marker. This change
  includes some new behavior and a new\n   configuration option:\n   * When you visit
  a post that has recent edits, the \"edited\" marker\n     will be highlighted. This
  highlight can be dismissed in the same\n     way as the \"New Messages\" cutoff,
  using the `M-l` keybinding.\n   * This feature can be turned off using by setting
  the\n     `showOlderEdits` configuration option to `False`.\n * New commands:\n
  \  * The `/remove-user` command removes a user from a channel.\n   * The `/group-msg`
  command creates a new private group channel\n     including several users.\n   *
  The `/search [term]` command searches the chat history for posts\n     that include
  the provided text and displays those posts in an\n     overlay. Thanks to @abhin4v
  for this change!\n * Matterhorn now includes embedded hyperlinks using terminal
  escape\n   sequences in terminals that support them. For more information on\n   terminal
  support for hyperlink escape sequences, please see [this\n   gist](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda)\n
  \  and its associated discussion.\n * The width of the channel list (in columns)
  is now configurable with\n   `channelListWidth`, which defaults to 20.\n * The `urlOpenCommand`
  can now be an interactive terminal-based\n   program (such as a terminal-based web
  browser) but this requires\n   the configuration option `urlOpenCommandIsInteractive`
  to be set to\n   `True`. This defaults to `False` and should not be changed if the\n
  \  `urlOpenCommand` is not a terminal-based program.\n * The current selection in
  channel select mode can be moved forward\n   and backward with `C-n` and `C-p`.
  (fixes #139)\n * Quotation blocks now include visible characters in addition to\n
  \  indentation.\n * We now honor the server's notification settings for channels.\n\nBug
  fixes:\n * New direct-message channels are properly added to running sessions\n
  \  (fixes #264)\n * No more reporting of \"resource vanished\" exceptions (fixes
  #116)\n * Missing editing keybindings now included in edit binding list\n   (fixes
  #139)\n * Websocket message parse failures no longer result in crashes (fixes\n
  \  #297)\n * The sidebar no longer shows deleted users (fixes #316)\n * Tab-completion
  no longer includes deleted users (fixes #320)\n * User status updates are now rate-limited
  (fixes #282)\n * Private channels can be deleted successfully (fixes #304)\n * External
  commands now run in the background in their own thread and\n   do not block the
  main UI (fixes #270)\n * Channel renaming is honored at runtime and does not require
  a\n   restart (fixes #324)\n * Group channel show/hide preferences are observed,
  which in practice\n   means a user can now 'leave' a several-user group channel\n
  * New channels will not appear twice in the sidebar (fixes #327)\n * New messages
  to previously-hidden group channels will cause the\n   group channel to be shown
  again (fixes #326)\n\nPackage changes:\n * PRACTICES.md is now listed in extra-doc-files.\n
  * Three scripts usable with the `/sh` command are now listed in\n   extra-doc-files:\n
  \  * `cowsay` runs the message text through the `cowsay` shell command\n     and
  formats the output as a verbatim block. This command requires\n     the `cowsay`
  command-line program to be installed externally.\n   * `figlet` runs the message
  text through the `figlet` shell command\n     and formats the output as a verbatim
  block. This command requires\n     the `figlet` command-line program to be installed
  externally.\n   * `rot13` runs the trivial ROT13 subsitution cipher over the\n     message
  text and otherwise passes it through unchanged.\n\n40000.1.0\n=========\n\nNew features:\n
  * Messages that start with a block-level element now get laid out so\n   that the
  block level element appears underneath, rather than to the\n   right of, the user
  name. This helps with long usernames such as bots.\n   Thanks to @kellymclaughlin
  for this change.\n * Code blocks with fencing now display the language when syntax\n
  \  highlighting is active.\n * In channel scroll mode, Up/Down arrow keys scroll
  by just one row\n * All channel and user data are now fetched more efficiently on
  startup\n   for greatly improved startup time.\n\nBug fixes:\n * The `/members`
  command now only shows active users (fixes #315)\n * Reset edit mode after handling
  commands and message input, provide\n   reply context when running commands (fixes
  #305)\n * Allow all unknown client commands to fall through to server (fixes\n   #306)\n
  * Improve uniqueness comparisons for URL lists\n\n40000.0.2\n=========\n\nBug fixes:\n
  * Attachments no longer appear in duplicate for edited messages.\n\nPackage changes:\n
  * CHANGELOG.md is now listed in extra-doc-files.\n\n40000.0.1\n=========\n\nPackage
  changes:\n * Upgraded mattermost-api to 40000.0.1.\n * Upgraded mattermost-api-qc
  to 40000.0.1.\n\nBug fixes:\n * Ignore `emoji_added` websocket events rather than
  crashing due to\n   JSON decode failures (#296)\n * `channel_viewed` websocket events
  from 4.0 servers\n   lacking a `channel_id` value no longer cause a client crash\n
  \  (https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/PLT-7252)\n * mkrelease.sh: use correct
  bindist file extension (#295)\n\n40000.0.0\n=========\n\nThis release supports server
  version 4.0.\n\nPackage changes:\n * Upgraded mattermost-api to 40000.0.0.\n * Upgraded
  mattermost-api-qc to 40000.0.0.\n\nBug fixes:\n * Attempts to `/focus` your own
  DM channel no longer trigger a server\n   error (fixes #294)\n * Message edits now
  properly restore message reactions and attachments\n   (fixes #292)\n * DM channels
  with topics now display those topics in addition to the\n   DM channel user identification.\n
  * Rendering of attachments regressed in 31000.0.0 and is now fixed\n   so that attachments
  are displayed beneath, not to the right of, their\n   messages.\n\nNew features:\n
  * Markdown image alt text is now rendered when available and Markdown\n   images
  are now available in the C-o URL list (fixes #285)\n * Added a new configuration
  setting, `showBackgroundActivity`, which\n   determines whether the status of Matterhorn's
  asynchronous work queue\n   is displayed in the interface. This setting is mostly
  for developers\n   but can be a helpful diagnostic tool. When enabled, the setting\n
  \  causes the async queue length to appear in the lower-right corner of\n   the
  interface.\n * Added a new configuration setting,\n   `unsafeUseUnauthenticatedConnection`,
  which causes Matterhorn to use\n   a non-HTTPS connection when connecting to the
  configured host and\n   port. As the sample configuration file says, use this only
  if you\n   know what you are doing.\n\nInternal changes:\n * Added support for 4.0's
  `channel_viewed` and `channel_updated`\n   websocket events.\n\n31000.0.0\n=========\n\nThis
  release supports server version 3.10.0.\n\nPackage changes:\n * Upgraded mattermost-api
  to 31000.0.0.\n * Upgraded mattermost-api-qc to 31000.0.0.\n\nNew features and keybindings:\n
  * Matterhorn now supports Flagged Posts. To use this feature:\n   * Press M-8 or
  use the /flags command to show a list of your\n     flagged posts. Within that view,
  'f' will unflag a selected\n     message.\n   * In message selection mode in channels
  (C-s), 'f' will flag/unflag\n     the selected message.\n   * Flagged posts appear
  with a flag marker \"[!]\" next to the author's\n     username.\n * Syntax highlighting
  of fenced code blocks is now supported in\n   256-color terminals. Code blocks must
  provide the langauge hint using\n   the same syntax as supported by the web client.\n
  * Spell checking of user input is now supported using Aspell. To use\n   this feature:\n
  \  * Install the Aspell binary and dictionaries on your system.\n   * Set enableAspell
  = true in your Matterhorn configuration.\n   * Optionally, set aspellDictionary
  to the name of the Aspell\n     dictionary you want to use (this is only necessary
  if you want to\n     override your LANG setting, which is typically sufficient)\n
  \  * Once user input is entered into the input area, a short delay after\n     typing
  stops, a spell check will highlight any misspelled words.\n * Home and End now move
  the cursor as usual in editor while in normal\n   mode, and also navigate the message
  list while scrolling.\n * Matterhorn now displays the mention count in the channel
  sidebar to\n   mimic the web client behavior and highlights channels with at least\n
  \  one mention in magenta in the sidebar.\n\nBug fixes and improvements:\n * Configuration
  file values can now use quoted string syntax (fixes\n   #269)\n * The channel switch
  mode prompt now mentions anchors.\n * The URL opening command is now run asynchronously.\n
  * Input history files are now saved with an appropriate file mode (fixes #218)\n
  * Fixed a bug that caused users created after a session began not to\n   appear
  in the sidebar.\n * Help topics (valid arguments to /help) are now displayed in
  the main\n   help UI (fixes #225)\n * Message deletion now also deletes replies
  to the deleted message\n   (fixes #257)\n * On channel deletion, leave before deleting
  to avoid a server error.\n * URLs in the URL list are now displayed in the same
  order in which\n   they appear in messages (fixes #250)\n * User identification
  now appears in DM channel headers.\n * Numbered lists now render starting at first
  specified number (fixes\n   #243)\n * The login screen now displays validation errors
  for hostname and port\n   inputs when appropriate (fixes #242)\n * Channel select
  inputs that have an exact match no longer require\n   ^/$ anchors.\n\n30802.1.0\n=========\n\nThis
  release supports server version 3.8.2. This release is our first\nofficial public
  release.\n\nPackage changes:\n * Removed stale array and data-default dependencies\n
  * Increased lower bound on base dependency to 4.8 to relect our GHC\n   testing.\n\nImprovements:\n
  * Subprocess error logs are now only created on demand. Previously we\n   created
  them on startup before any subprocess errors had occurred.\n * We now provide a
  QuickCheck test for some infrastructure.\n\nBug fixes:\n * Fixed a bug whereby some
  resize operations would cause a program\n   crash by triggering an unsafe mutable
  vector operation in Vty.\n * New user creation is now handled successfully and no
  longer requires\n   a client restart to function reliably. Previously bad behavior\n
  \  included not coloring new users' names and not showing new users'\n   names at
  all on their messages.\n * Message selection mode is no longer blocked by errors
  and other\n   non-post content.\n * Subprocesses that fail to run are now consistently
  mentioned in the\n   subprocess error log.\n\n30802.0.0\n=========\n\nThis release
  supports server version 3.8.2.\n\nPackage changes:\n* Relax constraint on containers
  to allow 0.5.7 or greater.\n* Upgraded mattermost-api to 30802.0.0.\n\nBug fixes:\n*
  The help interface now updates properly when showing either the main\n  help window
  or the scripts help window.\n* Attachments are now saved asynchronously.\n* Attachments
  are now opened without using the browser, thus removing\n  our dependency on a valid
  browser session with the server (fixes #128)\n* Editing state is now saved before
  switching history entries (fixes\n  #210)\n* Messages with unknown authors trigger
  a user metadata fetch (fixes #205)\n\nNew keybindings:\n* C-o now opens the URL
  list while scrolling through channel messages.\n* C-c now cancels channel selection
  in C-g mode\n\nUI changes:\n* Channel scroll mode keybindings were added to the
  help page.\n* We no longer perform string highlighting on the contents of Markdown\n
  \ code spans in messages.\n* On startup, only the scrollback for Town Square is
  fetched to improve\n  performance. Scrollback for other channels is fetched on demand.\n*
  We now use the channel sigil \"~\" rather than \"#\" to match the web\n  client
  behavior, and highlight ~-prefixed channel names (fixes #204).\n\n30701.0.0\n=========\n\nThis
  release supports server version 3.7.1.\n\nNew features:\n * Matterhorn now has basic
  support for 3.7's new \"group channel\"\n   feature. If other users add you to a
  group channel, it will appear in\n   the sidebar with the member usernames listed
  (e.g. \"#bob, sue, ...\").\n   Creation of group channels will be supported in a
  future release.\n * When the `urlOpenCommand` program produces output on standard
  output\n   or standard error, this output is now logged and a message is posted\n
  \  in the current channel with the path to the log file. This feature\n   prevents
  the URL open command from poisoning the terminal state with\n   unexpected output.\n
  * Added a `/members` command to show current channel membership.\n * Channel header
  changes from other users will now cause the channel\n   topic string to update.\n
  * Added a `/delete-channel` command to delete the current channel.\n * Markdown
  rendering now puts empty lines between adjacent block\n   elements of the same variety
  to improve readability.\n\nBug fixes:\n * Message selection now only supports reply/edit/delete
  on normal posts\n   (fixes #174)\n * C-n/p now only change channels when a non-DM
  channel is selected\n   (fixes #82)\n * We now handle new user events (fixed #111)\n
  * On channel change we now always reset the channel list to scroll to\n   the top
  (fixes #138)\n * When a draft message is left in the editor when changing channels,
  a\n   new sigil (\"»\") appears for the previous channel instead of the usual\n
  \  \"#\" to indicate this.\n * The help interface now resizes properly all the time.\n\nPerformance
  improvements:\n * On startup, all channel contents are fetched asynchronously. Town\n
  \  Square fetches are prioritized. These changes drastically improve\n   startup
  time, even on fast connections.\n\nDocumentation changes:\n * The README now includes
  a feature list, a brief feature overview for\n   new users, and a section on how
  to contribute.\n\nPackage changes:\n * Upgraded mattermost-api to 30701.0.0.\n *
  Binary releases now include the copyright and licensing information\n   for all
  dependencies.\n\nInternal changes:\n * Added preemption support for asynchronous
  work queue processing.\n   `doAsync(With)` now both take an `AsyncPriority`.\n\n30600.2.4\n=========\n\nNew
  editing keybindings:\n * C-w, M-Backspace now delete the word to the left of the
  cursor.\n * M-d deletes the word to the right of the cursor.\n * C-k now kills text
  from the cursor to the end of the line and copies\n   to an internal buffer; C-y
  pastes from said buffer.\n * C-b, C-f move back and forward by one word, respectively.\n\n*
  Many editing keybindings are now present in their own Help page\n  section.\n\nPackage
  changes:\n * Upgraded text-zipper to 0.10.\n * Upgraded mattermost-api to 30600.2.2.\n\n30600.2.3\n=========\n\nBug
  fixes:\n * Message-yanking failures due to missing programs (e.g. xclip) no\n   longer
  trigger an unhandled exception (fixes #170)\n * Users that are not members of the
  current team are now hidden from\n   the user list (fixes #161)\n * User statuses
  in the sidebar are now periodically refreshed\n * Supported server commands now
  appear on the help screen (fixes #162)\n * Files containing non-UTF-8 content no
  longer trigger unhandled\n   exceptions when being read by matterhorn (fixes #168)\n
  * Updated repository URL in error message about reporting problems\n   (thanks @tommd)\n\n30600.2.2\n=========\n\n*
  Improved formatting of message attachments so that their filenames\n  are shown.
  Previously only their hash identifiers were displayed. This\n  change also entails
  asynchronous fetching of attachment metadata.\n* Upgraded to mattermost-api 30600.2.1.\n\n30600.2.1\n=========\n\n*
  Fixed a bug that caused message selection mode to trigger a Vty crash\n  when a
  message being rendered was larger than half of the area\n  available for the message
  list.\n\n30600.2.0\n=========\n\n* Added a new message selection mode. This mode
  provides access to four\n  new features: replies, edits, deletion, and verbatim
  text yanking. To\n  enter this mode, use the default binding of C-s (and cancel
  with Esc).\n  The resulting cursor can be used to select messages in the current\n
  \ channel and perform the following actions on them:\n\n  * y: for messages with
  any verbatim text, yank the verbatim text to\n    the first verbatim block in the
  message to the system clipboard\n    (works on Linux and OSX)\n  * r: reply to the
  selected message. To cancel a reply, press C-c or\n    Esc.\n  * e: for messages
  written by the current user, edit the selected\n    message. To cancel an edit,
  press C-c or Esc.\n  * d: for messages written by the current user, delete the selected\n
  \   message (with a confirmation).\n  * o: for messages containing URLs, open all
  URLs in the selected\n    message.\n  * j/k/up/down/pgup/pgdown: change the selected
  message cursor\n    position.\n\n* Added a C-r binding to begin a reply to the most
  recently posted\n  message in the current channel.\n* M-e now toggles multiline
  editing mode rather than just enabling it.\n  Previously, Esc toggled it off.\n*
  Upgraded to mattermost-api 30600.2.0.\n\n30600.1.0\n=========\n\n* Upgraded to mattermost-api
  30600.1.0. This fixed /me and /shrug\n  server-side command execution failures.\n\n30600.0.0\n=========\n\nInitial
  versioned release for server version 3.6.0.\n"

  [![Build\nStatus](https://travis-ci.org/matterhorn-chat/matterhorn.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matterhorn-chat/matterhorn)\n\n![](logo.png)\n\nMatterhorn
  is a terminal client for the Mattermost chat system.\n\n![](screenshots/screenshot-00.png)\n\n#
  New Release Notifications\n\nGet notified about new Matterhorn releases by following
  our Twitter account!\n\n[https://twitter.com/matterhorn_chat](https://twitter.com/matterhorn_chat)\n\n#
  Chat With the Developers\n\nThe Matterhorn developers hang out on the official Mattermost\npre-release
  server. Stop by to get support and say hello!\n\n[https://pre-release.mattermost.com/core/channels/matterhorn](https://pre-release.mattermost.com/core/channels/matterhorn)\n\n#
  Quick Start\n\nWe provide pre-built binary releases for some platforms. Please see
  the\nrelease list to download a binary release for your platform that matches\nyour
  server version:\n\nhttps://github.com/matterhorn-chat/matterhorn/releases\n\nTo
  run Matterhorn, unpack the binary release archive and run the\n`matterhorn` binary
  within.\n\nWhen you run Matterhorn you'll be prompted for your server information\nand
  credentials. At present `matterhorn` supports only username/password\nauthentication.\n\nNote:
  Version `ABBCC.X.Y` matches Mattermost server version `A.BB.CC`.\nFor example, if
  your Mattermost server version is `3.6.0` then you\nwould download matterhorn version
  `30600.2.4`. See [Our Versioning\nScheme](#our-versioning-scheme) for details.\n\n#
  Configuring\n\nFor configuration options you have two choices:\n\n* Interactive
  configuration entered on each program run\n* Configuration via stored settings in
  a config file\n\nThe first option is useful when trying out the program because
  you can\nget up and running without worrying about making a configuration. Once\nyou're
  ready to make your settings persistent, they can be added to\na configuration file.
  An example configuration file can be found at\n`sample-config.ini`. Any settings
  omitted from the configuration will be\nobtained interactively at startup.\n\nWhen
  looking for configuration files, matterhorn will prefer\n`config.ini` in the current
  working directory, but will look in the\ntypical XDG configuration directories (you'll
  probably want to use\n`$HOME/.config/matterhorn/config.ini`) and as a last resort
  look for a\nglobally-accessible `/etc/matterhorn/config.ini`.\n\n# Using the Client\n\nThe
  user interface has three main areas:\n\n* Left: list of channels you're in, and
  list of users in your team and\n  their statuses (`+` means online, `-` means away,
  `×` means Do Not\n  Disturb, and an absent sigil means offline)\n* Right: messages
  in the current channel\n* Bottom: editing area for writing, editing, and replying
  to messages\n\nYou can use built-in keybindings or `/cmd`-style commands to operate\nthe
  client. To see available keybindings and commands, use the default\nbinding of `F1`
  or run the `/help` command. Keybindings may include\nmodifiers such as Control (indicated
  with a `C-` prefix) or Meta\n(indicated with a `M-` prefix). If your keyboard has
  an `Alt` key, that\nwill work as `Meta`. If it does not, you may be able to configure
  your\nterminal to provide `Meta` via other means (e.g. iTerm2 on OS X can be\nconfigured
  to make the left Option key work as Meta). Keybindings can\nbe customized in the
  configuration file; see `/help keybindings` for\ndetails.\n\nTo join a channel,
  use the `/join` command to choose from a list of\navailable channels. To create
  a channel, use `/create-channel`. To leave\na channel, use `/leave-channel`.\n\nTo
  create a private group chat amongst yourself and other users, use the\n`/group-msg`
  command, e.g., `/group-msg user1 user2`.\n\nTo see the members in the current channel,
  use the `/members` command.\n\nTo send a message, type it into the editor and press
  Enter to send.\nTo send a multi-line message, toggle multi-line mode with the default\nbinding
  `M-e`. Markdown syntax is accepted.\n\nTo edit your current message in an external
  editor (`$EDITOR`), use the\ndefault binding of `M-k`.\n\nTo preview the message
  you're about to send while you compose it (e.g.\nto check on how your Markdown syntax
  will be rendered), toggle preview\nmode with the default binding `M-p`.\n\nTo change
  channels, use `/focus` or one of the default bindings `C-n`\n(next channel), `C-p`
  (previous channel), `C-g` (fast channel switch).\n\nTo directly message another
  user, use `/focus` or `C-g`.\n\n`C-g` channel switching mode does a substring match
  of the input text on\nthe channel and usernames; metacharacters `^` and `$` at the
  beginning\nor end of input, respectively, anchor the match in case of multiple\nmatches.
  The cursor in this mode is usable with `C-n` and `C-p`.\n\nTo switch to the channel
  you were in prior to the current channel, use\nthe default binding `M-s` (swap).
  The most recent channel is marked in\nthe channel list with a \"`<`\" indicator.\n\nTo
  switch to the next channel with unread messages, use the default\nbinding `M-a`.\n\nTo
  quickly show a list of URLs mentioned in the current channel and then\nopen one
  in your local browser, use the default binding of `C-o` and\nconfigure the `urlOpenCommand`
  configuration setting.\n\nTo edit, delete, flag, or reply to a message, select a
  message with\nthe default binding of `C-s`. Use the default binding of `C-c` to\ncancel
  these operations.\n\nMessages that have been flagged can be viewed with either the
  `/flags`\ncommand or `M-8`. This view allows you to select and unflag particular\nmessages,
  as well.\n\nTo enable spell-checking in the message editor, install Aspell and set\n`enableAspell`
  to `True` in your configuration. To override Aspell's\nchoice of master dictionary,
  set the `aspellDictionary` option to the\nname of the dictionary you'd like to use.\n\n#
  Features\n\n* Channel creation, deletion, and membership management commands\n*
  Optimized channel-switching modes: `M-a`, `M-s`, and `C-g`\n* Message posting, editing,
  replying, and deletion\n* Markdown rendering\n* Convenient URL-opening with local
  browser\n* Secure password entry via external command (e.g. OSX keychain)\n* Yank
  verbatim content from messages into the system clipboard\n* Preview message rendering
  before sending\n* Optional smart quoting for efficient Markdown entry\n* Edit messages
  with `$EDITOR`\n* Rebindable keys (see `/help keybindings`)\n* Message editor with
  kill/yank buffer and readline-style keybindings\n* Tab-completion of usernames,
  channel names, and commands\n* Spell-checking via Aspell\n* Syntax highlighting
  of fenced code blocks in messages (works best in\n  256-color terminals)\n* Flagging
  and unflagging of posts, which are then viewable with `M-8`\n  or `/flags`\n* Support
  for SOCKS 4 and 5 proxies via the `ALL_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`,\n  and `HTTPS_PROXY`
  environment variables. (Plain HTTP proxies are not\n  yet supported.)\n* Multiple
  color themes with color theme customization support\n* Custom notifications via
  notification scripts (see the\n  `activityNotifyCommand` configuration setting).\n\n#
  Spell Checking Support\n\nMatterhorn uses `aspell` to perform spell-checking of
  your message\ninput. To use this feature:\n\n * Install `aspell` and ensure that
  your installation includes\n   dictionaries corresponding to your `LANG` setting.
  To check this, ask\n   `aspell` to check some input:\n   ```\n   $ echo stuff |
  aspell -a\n   Error: No word lists can be found for the language \"en\".\n   $ echo
  $LANG\n   en_US\n   ```\n   If Aspell succeeds, the output will look like this:\n
  \  ```\n   @(#) International Ispell Version 3.1.20 (but really Aspell 0.60.6.1)\n
  \  *\n   ```\n * Set `enableAspell` to `True` in your `config.ini`\n * Enter any
  message input in the message editor in `matterhorn`. After\n   a short delay after
  you stop typing, misspelled words will turn red.\n\n# Building\n\n`matterhorn` is
  built with the provided `install.sh` script, which\nrequires `git` and an appropriate
  `ghc`/`cabal` installation.\n(Although the name suggests installtion, this will
  just do a build in\n`dist-newstyle`.) This script will pull the appropriate repos
  and build\nthe application. This is required for building Matterhorn since clones\nof
  some of our other dependencies may need to be locally available in\n`deps/` in case
  important changes to those dependencies have not yet\nbeen released.\n\n# Our Versioning
  Scheme\n\nMatterhorn version strings will be of the form `ABBCC.X.Y` where ABBCC\ncorresponds
  to the Mattermost server version supported by the release.\nFor example, if a release
  supports Mattermost server version 1.2.3, the\nABBCC portion of the `matterhorn`
  version will be `10203`. The `X.Y`\nportion of the version corresponds to our own
  version namespace for the\npackage. If the server version changes, `X.Y` SHOULD
  be `0.0`. Otherwise\nthe first component should increment if the package undergoes
  major code\nchanges or functionality changes. The second component alone should\nchange
  only if the package undergoes security fixes or other bug fixes.\n\n# Contributing\n\nIf
  you decide to contribute, that's great! Here are some guidelines you\nshould consider
  to make submitting patches easier for all concerned:\n\n - If you want to take on
  big things, let's have a design/vision\n   discussion before you start coding. Create
  a GitHub issue and we can\n   use that as the place to hash things out. We'll be
  interested to\n   discuss any usability / UI, performance, or compatibility issues.\n
  - Please make changes consistent with the conventions already used in\n   the codebase.\n
  - We follow a few development practices to support our project and it\n   helps
  when contributors are aware of these. Please see `PRACTICES.md`\n   for more information.\n\n#
  Frequently Asked Questions\n\n* Q: Does matterhorn support Gitlab authentication?\n*
  A: No. But we would be happy to work with contributors who are\n  interested in
  investigating what this would take and/or implementing\n  it.  See the Contributing
  section for details.\n"
