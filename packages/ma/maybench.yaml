  Maybench is a tool for comparing the performance
  between two versions of the same program, on a
  series of benchmarks that you design.

  Maybench aims to be easy to use, almost as easy
  as running "time your-program arg1..arg2". Ideally,
  it should be a simple matter for outsiders to write
  timing tests for your programming project and contribute
  them as part of your performance testing suite.

  The Darcs repository is available at <http://code.haskell.org/maybench>.
