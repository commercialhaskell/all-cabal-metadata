  # Mappings

  ## What's it do?

  This package does two jobs:

  * It offers a general typeclass [`Mapping`](src/Data/Mapping.hs) for
    types which represent functions `k -> v` (for fixed `k`, but
    arbitrary ordered `v`).

    There are some fairly straightforward examples which build up
    mappings where `k` is `Either`, or a pair, or `Maybe`, or `Bool`.

  * Three less trivial implementations are provided:

      * [Decision diagrams](src/Data/Mapping/Decision.hs), with nodes
         which may themselves be an arbitrary `Mapping` (there is some
         code for viewing these in the `examples` directory);

      * [Piecewise constant maps](src/Data/Mapping/Piecewise.hs) on an
         ordered domain `k`;

      * [Maps equipped with a default value](src/Data/Mapping/MapWithDefault.hs).


  ## Why did I bother?

  The aim is to use decision diagrams with nodes that are piecewise
  constant maps to store monomials for Grobner basis algorithms.
