  # Markov Tutorial

  Let Xₙ denote the nth state of a Markov chain with state space ℕ.
  For x ≠ 0 define transition probabilities

  p(x,0) = q,

  p(x,x) = r, and

  p(x,x+1) = s.

  When x = 0, let
  p(x,0) = q+r,
  p(x,x+1) = s.
  Let p(x,y) = 0 in all other cases.
  Suppose we wanted to find
  P\[Xₙ = j ∩ d = k],
  where d denotes the number of transitions from a positive integer to zero.
  There are three values we need to track —
  extinctions, probability, and state.
  Extinctions add a value to a counter each time they happen
  and the counter takes integral values,
  so they can be represented by `Sum Int`.
  Probabilities are multiplied each step,
  and added when duplicate steps are combined.
  We want decimal probabilities, so
  we can represent this with `Product Rational`.
  We will make a new type for the state.

  ```haskell
  newtype Extinction = Extinction Int
      deriving Generic
      deriving newtype (Eq, Num, Show)
      deriving anyclass Grouping
  ```

  Combining identical states should not change the state,
  so we make an instance of `Combine` as follows.

  ```haskell
  instance Combine Extinction where combine = const
  ```

  All that remains is to make an instance of `Markov`.

  ```haskell
  instance Markov ((,) (Sum Int, Product Rational)) Extinction where
      transition = \case
          0 -> [ 0 >*< (q+r) >*< id
               , 0 >*< s >*< (+1) ]
          _ -> [ 1 >*< q >*< const 0
               , 0 >*< r >*< id
               , 0 >*< s >*< (+1) ]
          where q = 0.1; r = 0.3; s = 0.6
  ```

  We can now easily see a list of states, deaths, and the probabilities.

  __`> chain [pure 0 :: Sum Int :* Product Rational :* Extinction] !! 3`__
  ```
  [ ((0,8 % 125),0)
  , ((0,111 % 500),1)
  , ((1,51 % 500),0)
  , ((0,9 % 25),2)
  , ((1,9 % 250),1)
  , ((0,27 % 125),3) ]
  ```

  This means that starting from a state of zero,
  after three time steps there is a 51/500 chance
  that the state is zero and there has been one death.
