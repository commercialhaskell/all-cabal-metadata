description: ! 'Manifolds, a generalisation of the notion of \"smooth curves\" or
  sufaces,

  are topological spaces /locally homeomorphic to a vector space/. This gives

  rise to what is actually the most natural / mathematically elegant way of dealing

  with them: calculations can be carried out locally, in connection with Riemannian

  products etc., in a vector space, the tangent space / tangent bundle.


  However, this does not trivially translate to non-local operations. Common

  ways to carry those out include using a single affine map to cover (almost) all
  of the manifold

  (in general not possible homeomorphically, which leads to both topological and geometrical

  problems), to embed the manifold into a larger-dimensional vector space (which tends

  to distract from the manifold''s own properties and is often not friendly to computations)

  or approximating the manifold by some kind of finite simplicial mesh (which intrinsically

  introduces non-differentiability issues and leads to the question of what precision

  is required).


  This library tries to mitigate these problems by using Haskell''s

  functional nature to keep the representation close to the mathematical ideal of

  local linearity with homeomorphic coordinate transforms, and, where it is

  necessary to recede to the less elegant alternatives, exploiting lazy evaluation

  etc. to optimise the compromises that have to be made.'
