synopsis: Client API for Mattermost chat system
changelog: ! "\n\n40900.0.0\n=========\n\n * Endpoints: enabled `mmPatchPost` and
  removed duplicate argument type\n   for `PostUpdate`.\n * Ensure that file fetching
  uses the V4 API endpoint.\n\n40800.0.2\n=========\n\n * The websocket connection
  now uses the V4 API endpoint.\n * submitRequest now also retries on \"resource vanished\"
  exceptions.\n\n40800.0.1\n=========\n\n * `createPool` now requires a secure connection
  argument. Previously it\n   always defaulted to `True` which broke insecure connection
  setups.\n * Removed the upper bound from `memory` to support GHC 8.4.\n\n40800.0.0\n=========\n\n
  * Fixed the URI for the mmUnflagPost API call.\n * Some JSON instances now more
  precisely handle missing optional\n   fields.\n * mattermost-api now supports connection
  pooling with persistent server\n   connections. A connection pool configuration
  is required to connect\n   to Mattermost servers (thanks to Abhinav Sarkar)\n\n40700.0.0\n=========\n\nAPI
  changes:\n * Added a websocket event constructor for the `delete_team` event added\n
  \  in 4.7.\n\n40600.1.0\n=========\n\nAPI changes:\n * The `UserSearch` type now
  wraps optional fields with `Maybe`. The\n   field types changed from `Text` to the
  appropriate ID type.\n * Removed defunct `Network.Mattermost.Types.mkSession` function.\n
  * Added an API endpoint function `mmGetUsersByIds` for getting users by\n   ID.\n\nOther
  changes:\n * The `doRequest` function used by APIv4 endpoint functions now invokes\n
  \  the connection's logger to log request method and URI.\n\n40600.0.0\n=========\n\nAPI
  changes:\n * This release provides implementations of many of Mattermost's version\n
  \  4 API endpoints in the new Network.Mattermost.Endpoints module. The\n   old version
  3 API is still provided by Network.Mattermost but will\n   be deprecated in a future
  release, and removed after that. Note\n   that this release chiefly exposes version
  4 endpoints used by the\n   Matterhorn application; endpoints not used there have
  not been tested\n   and so are left commented out in this release and may be enabled
  in\n   future releases as needed.\n * This release also provides first-class Haskell
  types corresponding to\n   the server-side configuration; see Network.Mattermost.Types.Config.\n
  * The Post data type got a new postEditAt field corresponding to the\n   (at the
  time) undocumented `edit_at` field of posts.\n * Websockets got action support;
  see\n   Network.Mattermost.WebSocket.mmSendWSAction and the new\n   WebsocketAction
  type (thanks to Abhinav Sarkar for this change)\n * All UTCTimes received from the
  Mattermost server are wrapped in a\n   `ServerTime` newtype to ensure that users
  cannot accidentally compare\n   such timestamps to local UTCTimes, since the server
  time is not\n   necessarily comparable.\n * Added Network.Mattermost.Endpoints.mmGetClientConfig
  to get the\n   client configuration from the server (Thanks to Kelly McLaughlin
  for\n   this change)\n\n40400.0.0\n=========\n\nAPI changes:\n * Added endpoints
  for some preference endpoints, group channels, and\n   post search:\n   * `mmChannelRemoveUser`\n
  \  * `mmCreateGroupChannel`\n   * `mmSearchPosts`\n   * `mmSetPreferences`\n * Added
  `GroupChannelPreferences` type for showing/hiding group\n   channels\n * Separated
  the previous `NotifyProps` type into `UserNotifyProps`\n   and `ChannelNotifyProps`.\n
  * Websocket parse failures are now captured and appear to the library\n   user as
  an `Either String WebsocketEvent`, where the `String`\n   represent a parse failure.\n
  * Add support for `user_role_updated` websocket event type.\n\n40000.1.0\n=========\n\nAPI
  changes:\n * The postRootId of Post is now a Maybe PostId to better reflect the\n
  \  actual wire format.\n * MinCommand now has fields for reply parent and root post
  IDs to\n   support replying to posts with commands such as /me.\n * CommandResponse's
  commandResponseType is now Maybe to permit optional\n   types.\n * PreferenceCategory
  got a new constructor, PreferenceCategoryLast,\n   mapping to the \"last\" preference
  category.\n * Added functions for bulk fetching for channel/user data:\n   * mmGetAllChannelsForUser\n
  \  * mmGetAllChannelDataForUser\n   * mmGetAllChannelsWithDataForUser\n\n40000.0.1\n=========\n\nAPI
  changes:\n * Added support for the `emoji_added` websocket event type.\n * WEData's
  JSON parser now permits both null and empty channel IDs.\n\n40000.0.0\n=========\n\nPackage
  changes:\n * Added lower bound for binary to avoid build failures in the websocket\n
  \  package on GHC 7.10 (see https://github.com/jaspervdj/websockets/pull/155)\n\nAPI
  changes:\n * Added support for the `channel_viewed` and `channel_updated`\n   websocket
  events\n\n31000.0.0\n=========\n\nAPI changes:\n * Added flagged posts API:\n   *
  Types: FlaggedPost\n   * mmGetFlaggedPosts\n   * mmFlagPost\n   * mmUnflagPost\n
  * Added preferences API:\n   * Types: Preference, PreferenceCategory, PreferenceName,\n
  \    PreferenceValue\n   * mmDeletePreferences\n   * mmSavePreferences\n   * mmGetMyPreferences\n
  * Added PostType for post types (joins, parts, header changes, etc.)\n   and changed
  the type of Post.postType to use this new type.\n * Added a new field WEData.wepMentions
  so that websocket events can\n   include the set of UserIds in a mention set.\n
  * Made most fields of PostPropAttachment optional.\n * Added a new PostPropAttachment
  type as defined by Slack and used by\n   Mattermost.\n * Allow null for the \"fields\"
  field of PostPropAttachment.\n * Extended PostPropAttachment with additional fields
  to better match\n   the upstream spec.\n\nOther changes:\n * Improved the LoginFailureException
  message format.\n * Refrain from logging passwords when logging login requests.\n
  * Logging operations seek to the end of the log in case of a shared log\n   file.\n\n30802.1.0\n=========\n\nThis
  release supports server version 3.8.2.\n\nAPI changes:\n* Made the PendingPost `created_at`
  field optional. It defaults to 0.\n  This behavior is due to Mattermost's support
  for admins setting the\n  creation timestamp to values in the past. A value of zero
  causes\n  the server to use the server's clock to set the creation timestamp.\n
  \ Any other value is only permitted for users with administrative\n  privileges.\n*
  Moved some types to a new Types.Internal module and exposed that\n  module for testing
  purposes. It should not be used by anyone wanting\n  a stable API. For a stable
  API, see the export list for the Types\n  module.\n\n30802.0.0\n=========\n\nThis
  release supports server version 3.8.2.\n\nAPI changes:\n* The `Network.Mattermost.Types`
  module is now directly exported and all\n  clients should obtain their types from
  this import. The types are\n  still exported from `Network.Mattermost` to allow
  time for this change\n  but this export is deprecated will be removed in a future
  version.\n* Added the CommandResponse type for the execute endpoint.\n* mmGetMoreChannels,
  mmGetChannelMembers, and mmGetProfiles now take\n  limit/offset parameters.\n* mmGetFile
  now supports v4 file-fetching.\n* Added new constructors to the WebsocketEventType
  corresponding to\n  server websocket events.\n* mmUpdateLastViewedAt was replaced
  with mmViewChannel.\n* Added the WithDefault type to wrap around bools and NotifyOptions.\n*
  Added NotifyProps types.\n* The `Token` type has been replaced with a `Session`
  type,\n  representing a combination of a `Token` and a `ConnectionData`\n  type.
  All exposed API functions which require an authenticated\n  connection will use
  this instead. This is a major breaking change,\n  but makes the API significantly
  cleaner.\n* Removed `UserProfile` type in favor of single pervasive `User` type.\n*
  Replaced the return type of `mmGetTeamMembers` to use a `TeamMember`\n  instead
  of raw JSON `Value`s.\n\nDocumentation:\n* All API functions how have corresponding
  HTTP route documentation.\n\nPackage changes:\n* Source repository was updated.\n*
  Constrained 'memory' version to avoid 'foundation' dependency.\n* Include Network.Mattermost.TH.\n*
  The `Network.Mattermost.Websocket` module now exports everything\n  exported by
  `Network.Mattermost.Websocket.Types` in order to cut\n  down on the number of imports
  needed by users.\n\n30701.0.0\n=========\n\n* Supports server version 3.7.1.\n\nAPI
  changes:\n* Tests now provide websocket event testing infrastructure\n* The Channel
  data type now supports Group channels (type \"G\")\n* Added mmGetTeamMembers to
  get the users in a channel\n* Added support for the Post type `system_header_change`
  and the post\n  properties `new_header` and `old_header` as described at\n  https://github.com/mattermost/platform/pull/4209\n*
  Removed the UserProfile type in favor of the User type (fixed #23)\n\nBug fixes:\n*
  WebSocket.Types: permit empty `team_id` in event data\n\n30600.2.2\n=========\n\nBug
  fixes:\n * Support optional `notify_props` and `last_password_update` in\n   mmGetUser
  responses.\n\nPackage changes:\n * Renamed ChangeLog.md to CHANGELOG.md.\n\nTesting
  changes:\n * Added support for testing websocket events and updated the test suite\n
  \  to check for expected websocket events.\n\n30600.2.1\n=========\n\nAPI changes:\n
  * Export FileInfo type\n\nBug fixes:\n * Fixed parsing of nullable width/height
  fields in FileInfo\n * Fixed parsing of create_at, update_at, and delete_at timestamp
  fields\n   in FileInfo\n\n30600.2.0\n=========\n\nAPI changes:\n * Added mmDeletePost\n
  * Added mmUpdatePost for editing posts\n * Post: make deletion time optional to
  match server API, do millisecond\n   conversion on JSON encoding\n * PendingPost:
  add fields for setting parents in case of replies\n * Export PendingPost type so
  it can be modified for replies and edits\n\nBug fixes:\n * Post: do millisecond
  conversion of timestamps on JSON encoding\n\n30600.1.0\n=========\n\nAPI changes:\n
  * MinCommand lost its unused minComSuggest field\n\nBug fixes:\n * The JSON format
  of MinCommand got its channelId field (3.5.0) renamed\n   to channel_id (3.6.0).
  See also:\n   https://github.com/mattermost/platform/issues/5281\n\nOther:\n * mmGetJSONBody
  got a debugging label that it now uses to generate\n   exception messages to indicate
  what kind of value it was attempting\n   to parse.\n\n30600.0.0\n=========\n\nInitial
  release for server version 3.6.0.\n\n0.1.0.0\n=======\n\nFirst version.\n"

  Status](https://travis-ci.org/matterhorn-chat/mattermost-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matterhorn-chat/mattermost-api)

  # mattermost-api

  Client side API for communicating with a Mattermost server, in Haskell.


  # Testing


  We use the MaterMost docker image for detecting changes in the API. See

  `.travis.yml` or the [Mattermost

  docs](https://docs.mattermost.com/install/docker-local-machine.html#one-line-docker-install)

  for the details.


  If you are testing your changes locally during development, you will want to run

  the script `./test/local_test_mm.sh`.


  **Note: The `local_test_mm.sh` script will stop and remove a docker container

  named `mattermost-preview`.**


  **Note: The tests can only be run once against a given Mattermost instance. This

  is because the scripts currently assume they can create an initial admin user.**


  **Note: The scripts assume the instance is reachable on `localhost:8065` over plain

  HTTP.**


  For use in production we use TLS, but for testing purposes we avoid the

  certificate setup.


  # Our Versioning Scheme


  This library uses the same versioning scheme as `matterhorn`, see [Our

  Versioning

  Scheme](https://github.com/matterhorn-chat/matterhorn/blob/master/README.md#our-versioning-scheme).

  The short version is that in `ABBCC.X.Y`, the `ABBCC` corresponds to Mattermost

  server version `A.BB.CC` and the `X.Y` portion of the version string corresponds

  to the version of `mattermost-api` package releases.
