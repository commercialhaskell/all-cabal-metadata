  ## Overview

  `magic-tyfams` writes the annoying parts of GHC plugins so you don't have to. It
  provides a convenient interface for implementing magical type families.

  For example, consider the following definition in `mypackage` of an always-stuck
  type family:

  ```haskell
  module Some.Module where

  type family CmpType (a :: k) (b :: k) :: Ordering
  ```

  We can generate a plugin that will solve this:

  ```haskell
  module Some.Plugin where

  plugin :: Plugin
  plugin = magicTyFamPlugin "mypackage"
                            "Some.Module"
                            "CmpType" $
    withStuckSemantics $ \[_k, a, b] ->
      pure $ promoteOrdering $ nonDetCmpType a b


  promoteOrdering :: Ordering -> Type
  promoteOrdering = flip mkTyConApp [] . \case
     LT -> promotedLTDataCon
     EQ -> promotedEQDataCon
     GT -> promotedGTDataCon
  ```

  Enabling this plugin via `-fplugin=Some.Plugin` will now automagically solve
  `CmpType`! Nice!

  ```haskell
  {-# OPTIONS_GHC -fplugin=Some.Plugin #-}

  import Proxy

  -- compiles just fine!
  test :: Proxy (CmpType Int Int) -> Proxy 'EQ
  test = id
  ```
