description: ! '# Mac OS core libraries


  Type-safe Haskell bindings to C-based frameworks of the Apple Mac OS SDK. Most

  notably, the library offers bindings to


  * CoreFoundation

  * CoreGraphics

  * Carbon Accessibility


  This library is unstable, experimental, WIP, and under active testing. Rely upon

  it with great care, and definitely avoid it in serious/production code.


  The bindings do not cover the all of the target frameworks, and it is likely

  they will never reach 100% coverage. Additions may nevertheless happen, and PRs

  adding functionality or even additional frameworks are very welcome.
