changelog: |
  0.9.6.9:
    * Fix dependency on package network

    * Fix and support ProgGen again

  0.9.6.4.4:
    * Support hscolour, by converting Japanese comments into UTF-8
    * Use optLevel 2 (corresponding to -O2) when compiling the query to the server
    * Remove -O2, -fvia-C, and Flag GHC7 from the .cabal file

  0.9.6.4.3:
    * Fix indentation in the Cabal file, which caused the wrong dependency
    * Suppress warnings
    * Add package description

  0.9.6.4.2:
    * Support GHC 7.10
    * Bundle the `predicates' files

description: |-
  MagicHaskeller is an inductive functional programming system for Haskell.
  This package contains the MagicHaskeller library, which can be used within GHCi or as an API for inductive program synthesis.
  It also contains the MagicHaskeller executable that is a standalone synthesis program which can be used interactively or as a backend server,
  and the MagicHaskeller.cgi executable that is a CGI frontend for providing the Web interface.
