description: |-
  MagicHaskeller is an inductive functional programming system for Haskell.
  This package contains the MagicHaskeller library, which can be used within GHCi or as an API for inductive program synthesis.
  It also contains the MagicHaskeller executable that is a standalone synthesis program which can be used interactively or as a backend server,
  and the MagicHaskeller.cgi executable that is a CGI frontend for providing the Web interface.
