  # Changelog for math-programming

  ## [0.5.0] -- 18 January 2023
  ### Changed

  - The API has been made more consistent.

  ## [0.4.0] -- 5 July 2020
  ### Added

  - The `RealFrac` constraint on `LPMonad` numeric types.

    This simplifies the constraints necessary in application code.

  ### Removed

  - The `writeFormulation` class method.

    This was impossible to implement correctly without requiring
    `LPMonad` to implement `MonadIO`, which should not be required in
    general.

  Initial release.
