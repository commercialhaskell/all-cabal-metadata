description: |-
  The MAC library implements /Mandatory Access Control/ concepts in
  Haskell.  It leverages Haskell type-system to restrict how data gets
  propagated within programs and ensures that sensitive data cannot be
  leaked by malicious or buggy code. The library enables untrusted code,
  i.e., code written by someone else, to securely manipulate sensitive
  data while preserving its confidentiality.

  The library provides secure versions of advance programming languages
  features like references, exceptions, and concurrency. This package is
  the accompanying code for the paper
  <http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~russo/publications_files/pearl-russo.pdf Functional Pearl: Two can keep a secret, if one of them uses Haskell>.
