  # Change Log

  ## 0.1.0.0 - 2023-05-12
  * First version.

  ## 0.1.0.1 - 2023-05-15
  * Fixed some typos, more detailed docs.

  ## 0.1.0.2 - 2023-05-17
  * Updated resolver to lts-20.21
  * Minor documentation changes.

  ## 0.1.0.3 - 2023-05-17
  * Fixed typo that caused build failure.

  ## 0.1.0.4 - 2023-05-18
  * Trying resolver ghc-9.4.5

  ## 0.2.0.0 - 2023-05-22
  * Some of the imperative-style constructions using list comprehensions
    have been replaced with more traditional Haskell constructions using map.
  * There is less reliance on the list indexing operator (!!), but the
    use of vector and (!) is avoided to keep this package focused on
    list math.
  * Documentation and examples have been added for the convolution functions.
  * Convolution type signatures have been changed to make them more generic,
    which is the reason for the major version bump.

description: |-
  This package contains standard one-dimensional mathematical transforms (FFT, Wavelet, etc.) applied to Haskell lists. Documentation including mathematical details and examples are included to facilitate use with small or moderate sized problems, and for educational purposes. The algorithms have a very consise representation in Haskell that is a direct translation of the mathematical formulations.

  Some of the examples use the HakellR package and the hybrid Haskell/R environment that it provides. This permits use of R statistical and graphics tools in a Haskell "playgound" that requires minimal configuration. HaskellR's Jupyter kernel for Haskell is an added bonus. The functions of this package do not depend R or HaskellR.
