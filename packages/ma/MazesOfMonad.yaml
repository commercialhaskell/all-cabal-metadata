description: "Welcome to Mazes of Monad, JP Moresmau's RPG Game!\r\n\r\nMazes of Monad
  is a console based game similar to Nethack. I haven't looked for originality there,
  that's true.\r\n\r\nTo install, it's as usual: runhaskell Setup.lhs configure, runhaskell
  Setup.lhs build,runhaskell Setup.lhs install.\r\n\r\nEverything is console based,
  so you have to type in actions (usually one word, or two). There is auto completion
  so you can type 'h' instead of 'help'. Some actions start little wizards that will
  ask you to type more information, or to choose from a list of items. To choose an
  item in the list, type in the number of the item. Just pressing the enter key without
  any number usually means \"Cancel\".\r\n\r\nYou first need to create a character.
  You can reuse a character for several mazes, but only one at a time. Your character
  will progress over time, and the monsters should become tougher as you progress.
  You can save the current state of a game (character + game) so you can go back to
  a previous situation if you die or go mad.\r\n\r\nTo create a character, type 'c'
  on the initial screen (get into the characters mode), then 'n' for new. You'll have
  to type in the name and gender, and then choose a profile. A profile is only an
  indication on how to generate your initial characteristic, but brings no limitations.
  As you progress your profile will be updated if you use other characteristics more.
  For example, a thief is not as strong as a warrior, but better in dexterity and
  intelligence. If you start as a warrior but do a lot of stuff requiring dexterity
  or intelligence, you may evolve into a thief.\r\nYou can refuse the character given
  to you any number of times. The number of gold coins and known spells you have is
  dependant on your characteristics, a merchant with a great charisma for example
  will probably have more gold to start with than a ranger.\r\nFor each characteristic
  you get three numbers: the first one is the current value, the second the normal
  value, the third the experience. When a characteristic is temporarily affected,
  its current value change but its normal value stays unchanged. Everytime you use
  a characteristic you may gain experience points, and experience points allow you
  to increase the normal value of the characteristic. So the more you use a skill,
  the better you get at it. For example, the more you try to trade with people, the
  better your intelligence and charisma will become.\r\n\r\nOnce you have a character,
  you exit the character screens ('b' for back), go into 'g' (ames) and start a 'n'(ew)
  game. You will find yourself in a maze. The goal is to find the exit.\r\n\r\nYou
  navigate with 'n'(orth), 's'(outh), 'e'(ast) and 'w'(est). 'm'(ap) shows you what
  you've discovered so far. 'i'(nventory) shows what you're carrying (use 'p'(ick)
  and 'd'(rop) to get or leave behind) items. 'ch'(aracter) shows you your current
  characteristics.\r\n\r\nWhen you meet a NPC, the NPC may attack you, or leave you
  alone. In that case you can decide to attack it, trade with it, convert it or steal
  something from it. Just choose the appropriate action when prompted, or Ignore to
  leave it alone.\r\n\r\nFighting can be done through melee combat or magic. You can
  also try to end the fight by praying your opponent to let you go, or bribe it.\r\n\r\nYou
  can cast magic spells to your opponent during fights (damaging spells) or to yourself
  when you're not in a fight (healing or improvement spells).\r\n\r\nSend me comments
  and suggestions!"
