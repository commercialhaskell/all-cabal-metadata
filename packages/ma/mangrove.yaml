synopsis: A parser for web documents according to the HTML5 specification.
changelog: "# Revision history\n\nVersion numbering for 'mangrove' follows the [standard
  Haskell versioning \npolicy](https://pvp.haskell.org), where the first *two* numbers
  together \nindicate the major version of the package, the third the minor, and the
  fourth \nthe patch; a fifth number is optional and indicates a revision purely to
  the \ndocumentation and/or packaging.\n\n\n## v/html/0.1.0.0. -- 2021-04-16\n\n###
  Added\n\n* f/1.1.  Parse HTML(5) documents into a very basic tree (see however the
  known \n  issues), or the intermediate character/token streams\n\n### Known issues\n\n*
  i/1.  Handling for some cases of mis-nested tags has not yet been \n  implemented,
  throwing an error to terminate parsing\n"

description: "# About\n\n'mangrove' provides an HTML5-compatible parser for web documents,
  implemented \nin Haskell.  In keeping with the immutable data paradigms, an emphasis
  has been \nplaced on avoiding side effects and mutable structures rather than strictly
  \nfollowing the official algorithms.  The resulting document tree can be returned
  \nto `willow` to be styled and rendered.\n\nThis readme is rather sparse, as it
  has been written for a subfolder of the \ncomplete repository; for full info on
  the project, see the primary readme in \neither [this directory](README.project.md),
  [its parent](../README.md), or the \n[online host](https://code.eitilt.life/src/willow/README.md),
  whichever of \nthose links may work.\n\n\n# Coverage reporting\n\nUnfortunately,
  the invocation of hpc by cabal-install <= 3.4.0.0 doesn't work \nproperly when multiple
  packages are developed as part of the same project.  \nUntil the next version is
  released, I recommend that you don't enable coverage \nreports for `mangrove`, in
  order for the tests themselves to run correctly.\n"
