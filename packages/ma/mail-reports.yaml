  # Revision history for mail-reports

  ## 0.3.0.0 -- 2021-01-04

  Removed support for streaming bytestrings. They only blew up the dependencies and did not provide any advantage, as none of the functions in this package have side effects anyway.

  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2020-12-21

  Also parse SMTP-TLSRPT aggregated reports.

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2020-12-19

  First version, parsing DMARC aggregated reports.
