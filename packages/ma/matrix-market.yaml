description: |
  The Matrix Market (MM) exchange formats provide a simple mechanism
  to facilitate the exchange of matrix data. In particular, the
  objective has been to define a minimal base ASCII file format which
  can be very easily explained and parsed, but can easily adapted to
  applications with a more rigid structure, or extended to related
  data objects. The MM exchange format for matrices is really a
  collection of affiliated formats which share design elements. In the
  initial specification, two matrix formats are defined.

  Coordinate Format - A file format suitable for representing general
  sparse matrices. Only nonzero entries are provided, and the coordinates
  of each nonzero entry is given explicitly.

  Array Format - A file format suitable for representing general dense
  matrices. All entries are provided in a pre-defined (column-oriented)
  order.
