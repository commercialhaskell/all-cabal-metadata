description: |-
  In Haskell you very often acquire values using the @with...@
  idiom using functions of type @(a -> IO r) -> IO r@.  This idiom forms a
  @Monad@, which is a special case of the @ContT@ monad (from @transformers@) or
  the @Codensity@ monad (from @kan-extensions@).  The main purpose behind this
  package is to provide a restricted form of these monads specialized to this
  unusually common case.

  The reason this package defines a specialized version of these types is to:

  * be more beginner-friendly,

  * simplify inferred types and error messages, and:

  * provide some additional type class instances that would otherwise be orphan
  instances
