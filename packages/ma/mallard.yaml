description: "# [Mallard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallard)\n\nNo frills migration
  for relational databases. Usable as either an application or library.\n\nMallard
  offers the following key features:\n\n* Dependency resolution with circular reference
  prevention.\n* Native migration scripts.\n* Accretive implementation. Purposeful
  omission of \"down migrations.\"\n\n## Installation\n\nThere are currently no packaged
  distributions for Mallard, though they are coming soon. We were added to Stackage
  on Sep 21, 2017. So we just might make it into the LTS-9.6. Packaged distributions
  for Homebrew and Debian will be coming along soon. Currently, we don't know if there
  is any demand for Windows or RPM distribution, let us know if there is.\n\n## Supported
  Databases\n\n* PostgreSQL\n\n## Application Mini-Manual\n\n```\nmigrator - applies
  PSQL database migrations.\n\nUsage: mallard ROOT [--host ARG] [--port ARG] [--user
  ARG] [--password ARG]\n               --database ARG [-t|--test]\n  Apply migrations
  to a database server.\n\nAvailable options:\n  --host ARG               Server host
  (default: \"127.0.0.1\")\n  --port ARG               Server port (default: 5432)\n
  \ --user ARG               Username (default: \"postgres\")\n  --password ARG           Password
  (default: \"\")\n  --database ARG           Database name\n  -t,--test                Run
  tests after migration.\n  -h,--help                Show this help text\n```\n\n##
  Migration Structure\n\nMallard is designed to use a single root folder for all the
  migrations that define a database. Within this folder any structure is permitted.
  However, we recommend something like the following.\n\n```\n- root\n    - tables\n
  \       - person.sql\n        - phone.sql\n    - views\n        - person_with_phone.sql\n
  \   - functions\n        - add_phone.sql\n```\n\nWherein the migrations related
  to a given entity are kept in a single file. One such file might look like the following.\n\n```sql\n--
  #!migration\n-- name: \"tables/phone\",\n-- description: \"Phone numbers attached
  to a person.\",\n-- requires: [\"tables/person\"];\nSET search_path TO contact;\n\nCREATE
  TABLE phone(\n    id          BIGSERIAL       NOT NULL,\n    owner_id    bigint
  \         NOT NULL,\n    digits      text            NOT NULL,\n\n    PRIMARY KEY
  (id),\n    \n    FOREIGN KEY (owner_id) REFERENCES person(id)\n);\n\n-- #!migration\n--
  name: \"tables/phone/name\",\n-- description: \"Add name column to phone number.\",\n--
  requires: [\"tables/phone\"];\nSET search_path TO contact;\n\nALTER TABLE phone
  ADD COLUMN name text;\n```\n\nMallard is perfectly happy to accept as many migrations
  in a single file as you are willing to put there. However, there are a few rules
  you will have to follow.\n\n* The SQL comments in which a migrations header are
  located must be contiguous.\n* Each migration or test must begin with `#!migration`
  or `#!test`.\n* Each header field must end with `,`, or if it is the last field
  a `;`.\n\nThese rules allow the header to be fully defined in the comments of an
  otherwise normal SQL file."
