changelog: |
  0.7 [2019.05.10]
  ----------------
  * Remove the `Monad` instances for `Mealy` and `MealyT`, as they were
    inconsistent with the `Applicative` instances.
  * Add a `Data.Machine.Group.General` module.
  * Add a `takingJusts` function to `Data.Machine.Process`.
  * Add `Semigroup` and `Monoid` instances for `Moore`.
  * Support building with `base-4.13` (GHC 8.8).

  0.6.4 [2018.07.03]
  ------------------
  * Add `Semigroup` and `Monoid` instances for `Mealy` and `MealyT`.
  * Mark `runT` and `runT_` as `INLINEABLE`.
  * Increase the scope of the benchmarks. Also include the `streaming` library
    among the things that are benchmarked.
  * Allow building with `containers-0.6`.

  0.6.3
  -----
  * Add `Semigroup` instance for `Is`
  * Add `MonadFail` instance for `PlanT`
  * Support `doctest-0.12`

  0.6.2
  -----
  * Revamp `Setup.hs` to use `cabal-doctest`. This makes it build
    with `Cabal-2.0`, and makes the `doctest`s work with `cabal new-build` and
    sandboxes.
  * Various performance improvements
  * Add the `flattened` and `traversing` functions, as well as the `AutomatonM`
    class, to `Data.Machine.Process`
  * Add the `Data.Machine.MealyT` module
  * Add `plug` to `Data.Machine.Source`
  * Add `capT` to `Data.Machine.Tee`
  * Fix a bug in `teeT` that caused it to run actions too many times
  * Add `capWye` to `Data.Machine.Wye`

  0.6.1
  -----
  * Bumped upper version bounds for `comonad`, `conduit-combinators`, `criterion`, `distributive`, `pointed`, and `transformers`
  * Fix compilation with `stack`
  * Added `strippingPrefix`, `unfold`, `unfoldT`, `zipping`

  0.6
  ---
  * Added better fanout combinators. `Data.Machine.Fanout`
  * Added a module for lifting machines that run in transformed monads. `Data.Machine.Lift`
  * Added instances for `Mealy` and `Moore`.
  * Explicitly implemented `(<*>)` `(*>)` and `(<*)` for `PlanT`.
  * Added `Data.Machine.Runner` with various tools for running machines.
  * Added `teeT`.
  * Added `unfoldPlan` and `preplan`

  0.5.1
  -----
  * `profunctors` 5 support
  * GHC 7.10 warnings have been cleaned up

  0.5
  ---
  * Major bug fix (and semantic change) for `Plan`'s `(<|>)`.

  0.4.2
  -----
  * Add `Monoid` and `Semigroups` instances for `MachineT`

  0.4.1
  -----
  * Support `void` 0.7, fixed upper bounds on dependencies going forward.

  0.4.0.1
  -----
  * Bumped the bounds for `mtl` and `transformers`

  0.4
  -----

  0.2.5
  -----
  * Added `deconstruct`, `tagDone` and `finishWith`

  0.2.4
  -----
  * Added `asParts`, `sinkPart_`, `autoM`, and `fitM`

  0.2.1
  -----
  * Fixed the `Mealy` Monad

  0.2
  ---
  * Removed the input type parameter from (almost) all of the types.

  0.1
  ---
  * Initial release

  machines
  ========

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/machines.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/machines) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ekmett/machines.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ekmett/machines)

  *Ceci n'est pas une pipe*

  Machines are demand driven input sources like pipes or conduits, but can support multiple inputs.

  You design a `Machine` by writing a `Plan`. You then `construct` the machine.

  Simple machines that take one input are called a `Process` and processes form a `Category`. More generally you can attach a
  `Process` to the output of any type of `Machine`, yielding a new `Machine`.

  More complicated machines provide other ways of connecting to them.

  Typically the use of machines proceeds by using simple plans into machine `Tee`s and `Wye`s, capping many of the inputs to
  those with possibly monadic sources, feeding the rest input (possibly repeatedly) and calling `run` or `runT` to get the
  answers out.

  There is a lot of flexibility when building a machine in choosing between empowering the machine to run its own monadic effects
  or delegating that responsibility to a custom driver.

  A port of this design to scala is available from runarorama/scala-machines

  Runar's slides are also available from http://web.archive.org/web/20161029161813/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4588997/Machines.pdf
