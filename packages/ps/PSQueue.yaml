description: |-
  A /priority search queue/ efficiently supports the
  operations of both a search tree and a priority queue. A
  'Binding' is a product of a key and a priority.  Bindings
  can be inserted, deleted, modified and queried in
  logarithmic time, and the binding with the least priority
  can be retrieved in constant time.  A queue can be built
  from a list of bindings, sorted by keys, in linear time.
