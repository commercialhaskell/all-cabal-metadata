  # CHANGELOG

  - 0.2.8.0 (2022-10-27)
      * Add a number of minor optimizations and INLINE pragmas:
          - The previous `INLINABLE` pragmas were insufficient to fully specialize
            functions. Add a bunch more. I believe they now do the job they were
            meant to.
          - Change the way we check for very short queues in `lbalance` and
            `rbalance` to avoid redundant size comparisons in the non-short
            case.
          - Make the fields of `Play` strict. I doubt this makes any practical
            difference, since `tourView` is `INLINE`, but in fact the fields are
            always in WHNF, so we might as well make that explicitly clear.
      * Fix a bug in `fromList`. It previously used the *first* occurrence
        of a duplicated key; it now uses the *last* occurrence, as documented.
      * Cleanup: refactor `binShrinkL` and `binShrinkR` into `bin`.
      * Bump deepseq upper bound to 1.6
      * Bump tasty upper bound to 1.6

  The psqueues package provides
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue Priority Search Queues> in
  three different flavors.

  * @OrdPSQ k p v@, which uses the @Ord k@ instance to provide fast insertion,
  deletion and lookup. This implementation is based on Ralf Hinze's
  <http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/hinze01simple.html A Simple Implementation Technique for Priority Search Queues>.
  Hence, it is similar to the
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/PSQueue PSQueue> library, although it is
  considerably faster and provides a slightly different API.

  * @IntPSQ p v@ is a far more efficient implementation. It fixes the key type
  to @Int@ and uses a <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree radix tree>
  (like @IntMap@) with an additional min-heap property.

  * @HashPSQ k p v@ is a fairly straightforward extension of @IntPSQ@: it
  simply uses the keys' hashes as indices in the @IntPSQ@. If there are any
  hash collisions, it uses an @OrdPSQ@ to resolve those. The performance of
  this implementation is comparable to that of @IntPSQ@, but it is more widely
  applicable since the keys are not restricted to @Int@, but rather to any
  @Hashable@ datatype.

  Each of the three implementations provides the same API, so they can be used
  interchangeably. The benchmarks show how they perform relative to one
  another, and also compared to the other Priority Search Queue
  implementations on Hackage:
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/PSQueue PSQueue>
  and
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/fingertree-psqueue fingertree-psqueue>.

  Typical applications of Priority Search Queues include:

  * Caches, and more specifically LRU Caches;

  * Schedulers;

  * Pathfinding algorithms, such as Dijkstra's and A*.
