  # psx: Haskell bindings for libpsx

  This library embeds libpsx in a GHC Haskell-compiled application.

  Note `libpsx` performs some trickery with signal handling in a process.
  Furthermore, when using this library, `sigfillset` will be wrapped so
  `SIGSYS` is *not* set, in order for the GHC RTS `ticker` thread not to
  block the signal and work properly with `libpsx`.

  See
  [this GHC proposal](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/533)
  for a potential future replacement of this library using functionality built
  into the GHC RTS.

  **Warning:** `libpsx` on current Ubuntu and Debian systems (from `libcap`
  2.44) is broken. Hence, this library contains a bundled version of `libpsx`
  by default. Disable the `bundled-libpsx` flag to use a system-provided
  version of the library, which must be from `libcap` version 2.46 or higher.
