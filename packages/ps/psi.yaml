  ψ
  =

  `psi`/`ψ` is just another custom Haskell prelude. It is inspired by
  Ambiata's [p](https://github.com/ambiata/p) and has the same focus on
  promoting use of safe constructs and avoidance of partial functions,
  but differs in approach. Most significantly, `ψ` follows the [Haskell
  package versioning
  policy](https://wiki.haskell.org/Package_versioning_policy) and is
  intended for release on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/).
