  # agreeing

  A simple data structure helping us ask questions of the following
  sort: "does all this data have the same /BLANK/ and if so what is it?"

  For example:

          doTheseHaveTheSameLength :: [String] -> String
          doTheseHaveTheSameLength l = case foldMap (Somebody . length) of
            Somebody n -> "They all have length " <> show n
            Nobody     -> "The lengths differ"
            Anybody    -> "You didn't give me any strings"

  This can of course be done with `Maybe (Maybe x)` instead, but doing
  so runs the risk of getting confused: which is `Nothing` and which is
  `Just Nothing`?
