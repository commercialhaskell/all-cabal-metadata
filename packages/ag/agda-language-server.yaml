description: "# Agda Language Server\n\n## Installation \n\nThe simplest way of acquiring
  Agda Language Server is through [agda-mode on VS Code](https://github.com/banacorn/agda-mode-vscode#agda-language-server).\nFollow
  the instructions and the language server should be installed within seconds.\n\n###
  Prebuilt binaries\n\nYou can also download prebuilt binaries [from the release page](https://github.com/banacorn/agda-language-server/releases)
  if you are using other LSP-compatible text editors. \n\nSupported platforms: **Windows**,
  **Mac**, and **Ubuntu**.\n\n### Build from source\n\nYou will need [Haskell Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
  to build the project:\n\n```\nstack install\n```\n\n## Why make it standalone?\n\n*
  for less impact on the Agda codebase\n* to help [decouple the Agda codebase](https://github.com/agda/agda/projects/5)\n*
  we can always merge it back to Agda later anyway\n"
