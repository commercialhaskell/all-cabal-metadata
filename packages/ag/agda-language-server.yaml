  # Agda Language Server

  ## Installation

  The simplest way of acquiring Agda Language Server is through [agda-mode on VS Code](https://github.com/banacorn/agda-mode-vscode#agda-language-server).
  Follow the instructions and the language server should be installed within seconds.

  ### Prebuilt binaries

  You can also download prebuilt binaries [from the release page](https://github.com/banacorn/agda-language-server/releases) if you are using other LSP-compatible text editors.

  Supported platforms: **Windows**, **Mac**, and **Ubuntu**.

  ### Build from source

  You will need [Haskell Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) to build the project:

  ```
  stack install
  ```

  ## Versioning

  The version is _x.y.z.w.a.b.c.d_ where _x.y.z.w_ is the version of the Agda Language Server and _a.b.c.d_ the version of Agda it embeds.
  It follows the Haskell PVP (package versioning policy).

  ## Why make it standalone?

  * for less impact on the Agda codebase
  * to help [decouple the Agda codebase](https://github.com/agda/agda/projects/5)
  * we can always merge it back to Agda later anyway
