description: |-
  This library provides a very simple function that translates just the code blocks
  of a literate Agda file to colourised, hyperlinked HTML. The output of this
  can then be run through Pandoc or other document processors to allow literate
  Agda to be comfortably written in any format that allows inline HTML snippets.

  There is also a simple command-line application (@agda-snippets@) included
  that can be used as a standalone file processor.

  The location of library source hyperlinks is configurable, as is the CSS class
  given to Agda code blocks.

  This package is pinned to particular Agda versions, and therefore does not
  obey the PVP, as Agda does not. You should use whichever version of this library
  corresponds to the Agda version you wish to use.

  The development version of this library, available from GitHub, may work with
  development versions of Agda, although it could be broken at any time. If you
  stick to stable versions, you should be fine.
