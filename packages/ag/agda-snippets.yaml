description: ! 'This library provides a very simple function that translates just
  the code blocks

  of a literate Agda file to colourised, hyperlinked HTML. The output of this

  can then be run through Pandoc or other document processors to allow literate

  Agda to be comfortably written in any format that allows inline HTML snippets.


  There is also a simple command-line application (@agda-snippets@) included

  that can be used as a standalone file processor.


  The location of library source hyperlinks is configurable, as is the CSS class

  given to Agda code blocks.


  This package is pinned to particular Agda versions, and therefore does not

  obey the PVP, as Agda does not. You should use whichever version of this library

  corresponds to the Agda version you wish to use.


  The development version of this library, available from GitHub, may work with

  development versions of Agda, although it could be broken at any time. If you

  stick to stable versions, you should be fine.'
