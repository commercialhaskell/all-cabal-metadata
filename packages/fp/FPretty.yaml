description: ! 'A pretty printer turns a tree structure into indented text,

  such that the indentation reflects the tree structure. To keep

  text short, substructures are put into a single line as far as

  possible. The library provides combinators for building

  pretty printers. It emphasizes simplicity and efficiency.'
