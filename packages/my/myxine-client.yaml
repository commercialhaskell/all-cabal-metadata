  [Myxine](https://github.com/GaloisInc/myxine) is a language-agnostic local
  server that lets you build interactive applications in the browser using a
  RESTful API. This package defines high-level typed Haskell bindings for using
  Myxine to quickly prototype surprisingly high-performance GUIs.

  Myxine itself runs as a local server, separately from these bindings. It is
  built in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started), and can be
  installed using the standard Rust build tool @cargo@:

  > $ cargo install myxine

  This Haskell package does __not__ manage the @myxine@ server process; it
  assumes that it is already running in the background (either started by an
  end-user, or managed by your own Haskell application).

  __Required extensions:__ This library relies on the @OverloadedRecordFields@
  language extension, since a variety of browser event interfaces share field
  names/types. Without enabling it, you'll see many bewildering errors about
  ambiguous names. You may also find useful for concision the extensions
  @NamedFieldPuns@ and @RecordWildCards@.

  __Package versioning and stability:__ This package should be considered in
  "alpha" stability at present. No compatibility between alpha versions is
  guaranteed.
