description: |-
  The mywork tool is a TUI tool that maintains a list of projects, the various
  locations for those projects, and notes associated with each location.  This
  is designed to help keep track of what you have been working on, the
  relationships of the various locations for a project, and to maintain context
  for that work (assisting a future resumption of work) via the notes.
