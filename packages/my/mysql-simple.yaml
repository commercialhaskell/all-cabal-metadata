  ## 0.4.9

  * Additional tuple instances of QueryParams (https://github.com/paul-rouse/mysql-simple/pull/57)

  ## 0.4.8.1

  * Allow build on ghc 8.4.x (https://github.com/paul-rouse/mysql-simple/pull/56)

  ## 0.4.8

  * Provide classes to simplify user-defined encoding and decoding of columns.

  ## 0.4.7.2

  * Fix question marks in string literals causing substitution errors (https://github.com/paul-rouse/mysql-simple/pull/54)

  ## 0.4.7.1

  * Use parseTimeM from Data.Time.Format instead of parseTime (https://github.com/paul-rouse/mysql-simple/pull/53)

  ## 0.4.7

  *  Allow JSON fields to be read in as ByteStrings (https://github.com/paul-rouse/mysql-simple/pull/52)

  ## 0.4.6

  * Support GHC-9 via blaze-textual shim (https://github.com/paul-rouse/mysql-simple/pull/51).

  ## 0.4.5

  * Add Semigroup instance for Query
  * Add a `(Param a) => Param (In (Set a))` instance.
  * Drop testing under GHC 7.8 / lts-2

  ## 0.4.4

  * Report table name and database in the UnexpectedNull case of ResultError, using the previously empty errMessage field

  ## 0.4.3

  * Use Data.Time.Format to parse TimeOfDay results properly (missing in https://github.com/paul-rouse/mysql-simple/pull/37).

  ## 0.4.2.0

  * Handle fractional seconds in parameter substitution (without affecting cases where only whole seconds are used).  https://github.com/paul-rouse/mysql-simple/pull/40

  ## 0.4.1.0

  * Add missing tuple instances of QueryResults (https://github.com/paul-rouse/mysql-simple/issues/9)
  * Fix `error "foo"` left in code (https://github.com/paul-rouse/mysql-simple/issues/39)
  * Allow fractional seconds in to be parsed in date/time results https://github.com/paul-rouse/mysql-simple/pull/37

  ## 0.4.0.1

  * Fix https://github.com/paul-rouse/mysql-simple/issues/35

  ## 0.4.0.0

  * Add type VaArgs for non-parenthesized variable-length list of parameters.
  * Include fieldName in other constructors of ResultError.

  ## 0.3.0.0

  * New maintainer and GitHub location - with many thanks to Bryan O'Sullivan for all of the past work on this module, and for facilitating the transfer of maintenance responsibility.
  * Extra instances of QueryParams for larger tuples.
  * Include fieldName in ResultError in the case of the Incompatible constructor.

  The changes to ResultError and QueryParams were previously unreleased,
  although present in the GitHub repository.  They are the reason for the
  major version bump.

  # mysql-simple: mid-level bindings to the mysqlclient library

  This library is a mid-level Haskell binding to the MySQL `mysqlclient`
  client library.  It is aimed at speed and ease of use.

  # Licensing

  This library is BSD-licensed under the terms of the
  [MySQL FOSS License Exception](http://www.mysql.com/about/legal/licensing/foss-exception/).

  Since this library links against the GPL-licensed `mysqlclient`
  library, a non-open-source application that uses it *may* be subject
  to the terms of the GPL.

  # To do

  * Add support for prepared statements. This API is huge and of dubious
    performance worth, so it's not currently a priority for me. Patches
    welcome!

  # Get involved!

  We are happy to receive bug reports, fixes, documentation enhancements,
  and other improvements.

  Please report bugs via the
  [github issue tracker](http://github.com/paul-rouse/mysql-simple/issues).

  Master [git repository](http://github.com/paul-rouse/mysql-simple):

  * `git clone git://github.com/paul-rouse/mysql-simple.git`

  # Authors

  This library was written by Bryan O'Sullivan, <bos@serpentine.com>,
  to whom all of the credit is due.
  It is now being maintained by Paul Rouse, <pyr@doynton.org>.
