  * Safer concurrency - see https://ro-che.info/articles/2015-04-17-safe-concurrent-mysql-haskell
  * Better support for building against MariaDB (not well tested).
  * Additional C binding: mysql_get_server_version().

  ## 0.1.2.1

  * Fix bystestring-valued connectOptions sometimes not being null terminated at the correct place (avoid unsafeUseAsCString).

  # mysql: bindings to the mysqlclient library

  This library is a Haskell binding to the MySQL `mysqlclient` client
  library.  It is a fairly faithful, low level library that implements
  most of the MySQL client API.  The major departure from the C API is
  that in Haskell, resource management is mostly automatic and safe.

  This library deliberately avoids the question of providing a "good"
  API. Its purpose is to serve as a base upon which higher-level
  libraries can be built.

  # Licensing

  This library is BSD-licensed under the terms of the
  [MySQL FOSS License Exception](http://www.mysql.com/about/legal/licensing/foss-exception/).

  Since this library links against the GPL-licensed `mysqlclient`
  library, a non-open-source application that uses it *may* be subject
  to the terms of the GPL.

  # To do

  * Add support for prepared statements. The prepared statement API is
    huge and of dubious performance value, so it's not currently a
    priority for us. Patches welcome!

  # Get involved!

  We are happy to receive bug reports, fixes, documentation enhancements,
  and other improvements.

  Please report bugs via the
  [github issue tracker](http://github.com/paul-rouse/mysql/issues).

  Master [git repository](http://github.com/paul-rouse/mysql):

  * `git clone git://github.com/paul-rouse/mysql.git`

  # Authors

  This library was written by Bryan O'Sullivan, <bos@serpentine.com>,
  to whom all of the credit is due.
  It is now being maintained by Paul Rouse, <pyr@doynton.org>.
