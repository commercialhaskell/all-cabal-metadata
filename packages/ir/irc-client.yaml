description: ! 'An IRC client library built atop

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/irc-conduit irc-conduit>. Why

  another IRC client library, you cry? I didn''t really find one that

  did what I wanted (specifically, handle connecting to servers and

  calling event handlers, possibly with TLS), but which didn''t

  implement almost a full IRC bot for you. That takes out all the fun!


  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/irc-conduit irc-conduit> and

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/irc-ctcp irc-ctcp> are my

  solution to the first part of that, this is my solution to the

  latter. It''s a simple IRC client library that does the basics for

  you, but isn''t an all-singing, all-dancing, fully-featured IRC

  /application/. It is a merely a simple library.'
