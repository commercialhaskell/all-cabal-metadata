  Overview\n\nO'Clock is the library that provides type-safe time units data types.\n\nMost
  understandable use case is using [`threadDelay`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.10.1.0/docs/Control-Concurrent.html#v:threadDelay)
  function.\nIf you want to wait for _5 seconds_ in your program, you need to write
  something like this:\n\n```haskell ignore\nthreadDelay (5 * 10^(6 :: Int))\n```\n\nWith
  O'Clock you can write in several more convenient ways (and use more preferred to
  you):\n\n```haskell ignore\nthreadDelay $ sec 5\nthreadDelay (Time @Second 5)\nthreadDelay
  @Second 5\n```\n\n## Features\n\n`O'Clock` provides the following features to its
  users:\n\n1. Single data type for all time units.\n\n   * Different time units represented
  as different type parameters for single `Time` data type.\n     Amount of required
  boilerplate is minimal.\n\n2. Time stored as `Rational` number.\n\n   * It means
  that if you convert `900` milliseconds to seconds, you will have `0.9` second instead
  of `0` seconds.\n     So property `toUnit @to @from . toUnit @from @to ≡ id` is
  satisfied.\n\n3. Different unit types are stored as rational multiplier in type.\n\n
  \  * `o-clock` package introduces its own kind `Rat` for type-level rational numbers.\n
  \    Units are stored as rational multipliers in type. Because of that some computation
  is performed on type-level.\n     So if you want to convert `Week` to `Day`, `o-clock`
  library ensures that time units will just be multipled by `7`.\n\n4. Functions from
  `base` that work with time are converted to more time-safe versions:\n\n   * These
  functions are: `threadDelay`, `timeout`, `getCPUTime`.\n\n5. Externally extensible
  interface.\n\n   * It means that if you want to roll out your own time units and
  use it in your project,\n     this can be done in easy and convenient way (see tutorial
  below).\n\n6. `O'Clock` contains useful instances like `Hashable`, `NFData`, `Serialise`,
  `ToJSON`, `FromJSON`\n   but it's not included to the package by default. To do
  that you need to provide corresponding\n   flag from this list: `hashable`, `deepseq`,
  `serialise` and `aeson`.\n\n_**Note:**_ features support for `GHC-8.2.2` and `GHC-8.0.2`
  is quite limited.\n\n## Example: How to make your own time unit\n\nThis README section
  contains tutorial on how you can introduce your own time units.\nLet's solve the
  following problem:\n\n_You're CEO of big company. Your employers report you number
  of hours they worked this month.\nYou want format hours in more human-readable way,
  i.e. in number of work weeks and work days.\nSo we want `140 hours` be formatted
  as `3ww2wd` (3 full work weeks and 2 full work days)._\n\n### Setting up\n\nSince
  this tutorial is literate haskell file, let's first write some pragmas and imports.\n\n```haskell\n{-#
  LANGUAGE CPP              #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds        #-}\n#if ( __GLASGOW_HASKELL__
  >= 806 )\n{-# LANGUAGE NoStarIsType     #-}\n#endif\n{-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications
  #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies     #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators    #-}\n\nmodule
  Main where\n\n#if ( __GLASGOW_HASKELL__ >= 804 )\nimport Time (type (*))\n#endif\nimport
  Time ((:%), (-:-), Time, Hour, UnitName,floorUnit, hour, seriesF, toUnit)\n\n```\n\n###
  Introduce custom units\n\nYou need to write some code in order to introduce your
  own time units. In our task we need\nwork day represented as `8` hours and work
  week represented as `5` work days.\n\n```haskell\n-- | Time unit for a working day
  (8 hours).\n#if ( __GLASGOW_HASKELL__ >= 804 )\ntype WorkDay = 8 * Hour\n#else\ntype
  WorkDay = 28800 :% 1\n#endif\n\n-- | Time unit for a work week (5 working days).\n#if
  ( __GLASGOW_HASKELL__ >= 804 )\ntype WorkWeek = 5 * WorkDay\n#else\ntype WorkWeek
  = 144000 :% 1\n#endif\n\n-- this allows to use 'Show' and 'Read' functions for our
  time units\ntype instance UnitName (28800  :% 1) = \"wd\"  -- One WorkDay  contains
  28800  seconds\ntype instance UnitName (144000 :% 1) = \"ww\"  -- One WorkWeek contains
  144000 seconds\n\n```\n\n### Calculations\n\nNow let's implement main logic of our
  application. Our main function should take hours,\nconvert them to work weeks and
  work days and then show in human readable format.\n\n```haskell\ncalculateWork ::
  Time Hour -> (Time WorkWeek, Time WorkDay)\ncalculateWork workHours =\n    let completeWeeks
  = floorUnit $ toUnit @WorkWeek workHours\n        completeDays  = floorUnit $ toUnit
  @WorkDay  workHours -:- toUnit completeWeeks\n    in (completeWeeks, completeDays)\n\nformatHours
  :: Time Hour -> String\nformatHours hours = let (weeks, days) = calculateWork hours
  in show weeks ++ show days\n```\n\nAfter that we can simply print the output we
  wanted.\n\nThought we have special function for this kind of formatting purposes
  `seriesF`.\nSo the similar result (but not rounded) can be gained with the usage
  of it. Check it out:\n\n```haskell\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do\n    putStrLn $ \"The
  result:   \" ++ formatHours (hour 140)\n    putStrLn $ \"With seriesF: \" ++ (seriesF
  @'[WorkWeek, WorkDay] $ hour 140)\n```\n\nAnd the output will be\n\n```haskell ignore\nThe
  result:   3ww2wd\nWith seriesF: 3ww2+1/2wd\n```\n"
