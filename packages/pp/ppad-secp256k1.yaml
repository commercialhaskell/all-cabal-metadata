  # Changelog

  - 0.5.1 (2025-12-27)
    * Improves the constant-time semantics in wNAF scalar multiplication,
      replacing "indexing via a constant-time selected value" by performing
      a full window scan and selecting via mask.

  - 0.5.0 (2025-12-21)
    * We get a significant upgrade to all functionality by pulling in the
      ppad-fixed library for large unsigned and Montgomery-form integers.
      Constant-time and allocation properties are made much more rigorous
      across the board, as we no longer depend on 'Integer' whatsoever.

      This version also improves performance radically throughout. A
      summary of the speedups achieved:

      sign_schnorr:   ~7.1x speedup
      verify_schnorr: ~4.5x speedup
      sign_ecdsa:     ~1.5x speedup
      verify_ecdsa:   ~4.5x speedup

  - 0.4.0 (2025-06-21)
    * Scalar multiplication, signing, verifying, and ECHD functions are now
      all total, returning 'Nothing' when supplied with invalid inputs.
    * Adds a group element check to 'mul_wnaf'.

  - 0.3.0 (2025-03-14)
    * Adds 'ecdh' for computing ECDH secrets, any given secret being the
      SHA256 hash of the x-coordinate of the appropriate secp256k1 point.

  - 0.2.2 (2025-02-16)
    * Exports the secp256k1 "point at infinity" as _CURVE_ZERO.

  - 0.2.1 (2024-12-18)
    * Adds 'serialize_point' for compressed-format serialization of
      secp256k1 points.

  - 0.2.0 (2024-11-08)
    * Adds wNAF ("w-ary non-adjacent form") scalar multiplication, as
      well as fast 'sign' and 'verify' variants for Schnorr and ECDSA
      (disambiguated by a trailing apostrophe) that make use of it.

      Each wNAF-powered function requires a 'Context' consisting of
      precomputed secp256k1 generator multiples; one can be gotten via
      'precompute'.

      Note that the non-wNAF-powered sign and verify functions have
      incurred a slight performance decrease (on the order of tens to
      hundreds of microseconds) as a result.

    * Adds 'parse_sig' for parsing compact signatures.

    * Adds a dependency on the 'primitive' library (already transitively required
      via 'ppad-hmac-drbg').

  - 0.1.0 (2024-10-19)
    * Initial release, supporting public key derivation and Schnorr &
      ECDSA signatures on secp256k1.
