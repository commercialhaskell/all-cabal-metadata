  # Changelog

  - 0.3.1 (2026-02-01)
    * Adds SPECIALIZE pragmas for IO and ST to improve the generated Core.

  - 0.3.0 (2026-02-01)
    * This backwards-incompatible version changes the "bring your own HMAC
      function" design and simply provides specialized DRBGs for
      HMAC-SHA256 and HMAC-SHA512, respectively. These HMAC functions are
      provided by ppad-sha256 and ppad-sha512.

    * The rationale here is to provide better security guarantees around
      the DRBG state. Now, the DRBG state is restricted to a single, pinned,
      heap-allocated mutable buffer; components of it are /never/
      allocated anywhere else on the heap during DRBG operation (not even
      in temporary, to-be-GC'd bytestrings). A new 'wipe' function is also
      exposed for explicitly zeroing out state when one is finished
      generating bytes from the DRBG.

    * Aside from the increased security guarantees, DRBG performance is
      dramatically improved, and other heap allocation dramatically
      limited, compared to previous versions.

  - 0.2.1 (2026-01-10)
    * Simply adds bounds to the ppad-sha{256,512} dependencies in the test and
      benchmark suites.

  - 0.2.0 (2026-01-10)
    * In order to better-match the spec, 'gen' now returns an
      'Either Error BS.ByteString'. The new 'Error' value is returned
      either in the exceptionally rare case that the DRBG needs a reseed
      (previously this was just "error <msg>"), or, more likely to occur
      in practice, if more than 65536 bytes are requested from the DRBG at
      a time.

  - 0.1.3 (2025-12-28)
    * Adds an 'llvm' build flag and tests with GHC 9.10.3.

  - 0.1.2 (2025-02-06)
    * Minor bytestring optimizations for shaving off microseconds in
      certain cases.

  - 0.1.1 (2024-10-07)
    * Add a basic placeholder 'Show' instance for the DRBG type.

  - 0.1.0 (2024-10-05)
    * Initial release.
