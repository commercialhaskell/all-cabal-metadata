  # Changelog

  - 0.1.5 (2026-01-08)
    * We now check if the ARM cryptographic extensions are available, and,
      if so, use them to calculate hashes. If they're unavailable we
      simply use the pure implementation as a fallback. This yields about
      a 5x performance boost for 'hash' and 3.5x boost for 'hmac' (again,
      when available).

    * Allocation for both the 'hash' and 'hmac' functions has been reduced
      dramatically, mostly by optimising the padding internals, and is now
      constant with respect to input.

  - 0.1.4 (2025-12-28)
    * Adds an 'llvm' build flag and tests with GHC 9.10.3.

  - 0.1.3 (2025-01-21)
    * Improves padding handling for the strict bytestring case, yielding
      performance increases for both 'hash' and 'hmac'.

  - 0.1.2 (2025-01-07)
    * Makes a minor optimisation to bytestring handling.

  - 0.1.1 (2024-10-13)
    * Adds an INLINE pragma to an internal step function.
    * 'hmac' no longer calls 'hmac_lazy', which has no practical effect
      other than to clean up profiling reports generated by GHC.

  - 0.1.0 (2024-10-07)
    * Initial release.
