description: |-
  Ogma is a tool to facilitate the integration of safe runtime monitors into
  other systems. Ogma extends
  <https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot Copilot>, a high-level runtime
  verification framework that generates hard real-time C99 code.

  Some use cases supported by Ogma include:

  - Translating requirements defined in
  <https://github.com/NASA-SW-VnV/fret NASA requirements elicitation tool FRET>
  into corresponding monitors in Copilot.

  - Generating the glue code necessary to work with C
  structs in Copilot.

  - Generating
  <https://cfs.gsfc.nasa.gov/ NASA Core Flight System>
  applications that use Copilot for monitoring data
  received from the message bus.

  - Generating message handlers for NASA Core Flight System
  applications to make external data in structs available
  to a Copilot monitor.

  - Generating
  <https://ros.org Robot Operating System (ROS 2)>
  applications that use Copilot for monitoring data
  received from different topics.

  - Generating
  <https://github.com/nasa/fprime F'>
  components that use Copilot for monitoring.

  The main invocation with @--help@ lists sub-commands available.
