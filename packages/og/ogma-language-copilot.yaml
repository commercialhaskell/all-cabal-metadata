  Ogma is a tool to facilitate the integration of safe runtime monitors into
  other systems. Ogma extends
  <https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot Copilot>, a high-level runtime
  verification framework that generates hard real-time C99 code.

  This library contains a frontend to read Copilot monitors, a definition of Copilot
  structs, and a backend to generate and pretty print Copilot code.
