  # TsWeb - A very opinionated web API

  TsWeb is a binding between the Spock web framework and the Beam database
  API. It provides convenience functions for running database queries from
  within Spock actions, a Spock session manager replacement using the Beam API,
  and type-safe routing including type-checked reverse lookups (URLs are
  associated with first-class labels which are used for reverse lookup).

  ## Sample Program

  Most of the functionality of TsWeb (ideally, all of it) is demonstrated in the
  example program, which lives under the Example directory of the source tree.
  Have a look there for a working example of TsWeb.

  ## Restricted Views

  TsWeb views run with minimal rights; by default they do not have access to the
  database nor do they have any user information initialized. A view's type
  signature enumerates its requirements, and those requirements are granted by
  the view's routing. For example, a view that needs read-write database access,
  an admin user, and a route to the index URL might have this type signature:

  ```
  myview ::
    ( ListContains n0 Admin xs
    , ListContains n1 ReadWritePool xs
    , Has "index" lts (Path '[] 'Open) )
    => TsActionCtxT lts xs sessdata a
  myview = do
    db :: ReadOnlyPool <- getExtra
    Admin me <- getExtra
    indexPath <- showPath #index
    ...
  ```

  And then the view would be routed as:

  ```
  runroute readonlypool readwritepool $
    path #index root (getpost indexView) .
    path #myview "mine" (dbwrite $ getpost $ auth adminP myview)
  ```

  See the docs for "TsWeb.Routing" and "TsWeb.Routing.Auth" for more details.

  ## Action Queries

  Have a look at "TsWeb.Db" for documentation on running Beam queries from a
  Spock context. This is just sugar, but it's pretty nice. A small example:

  ```
  myview :: ListContains n ReadWritePool xs => TsActionCtxT lts xs sessdata a
  myview = do
    queryList (select $ all_ (_dbUser db)) >>= \case
      QSimply users -> text $ T.pack $ show users
      QError err -> text $ "Error: " <> Text.pack (show err)
  ```

  See "TsWeb.Db" for more details.

  ## Session Manager

  This is pretty much invisible, but use TsWeb.Session.patchConfig on your Spock
  config to replace the default session manager with the TsWeb one. Lifted
  directly from the "TsWeb.Session" documentation:

  ```
  spockCfg <-
    patchConfig (_dbSession db) ropool rwpool <$>
    defaultSpockCfg sess PCNoDatabase ()
  runSpock port (spock spockCfg routes)
  where
    sess = ...
    routes = ...
  ```

  ## Type-safe URLs with reversing.

  TsWeb builds on Spock's reroute library to also add type-checked reverse
  lookups. There's a pretty complete document on that under "TsWeb.Routing",
  which I'm simply pasting in here:

  ```
  index :: Has "users" lts (Path '[] 'Open) => TsActionCtxT lts xs sess a
  index = showPath #users >>= text

  users :: Has "root" lts (Path '[] 'Open) => TsActionCtxT lts xs sess a
  users = do
    root <- showPath #root
    text $ "GET users, root is, " <> root

  usersPost :: TsActionCtxT lts xs sess a
  usersPost = text "POST to users!"
  ```

  Then, routing to those views looks like this:

  ```
  runroute ropool rwpool $
    path #root root (getpost index) .
    path #users "users" (do get users
                            post usersPost)
  ```
