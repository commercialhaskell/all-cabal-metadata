description: |-
  This is a thread-safe logging framework.  It logs to memory, with various
  options for serializing log messages out to a file or handle.  A verbosity
  level controls the quantity of log messages.
  For debugging, this logging framework can do double-duty by controlling the
  interleaving of threads which are producing log messages, for the purpose of
  fuzz-testing concurrent interleavings.  This is accomplished by blocking the
  threads at the point of each logging message, and controlling the order in
  which threads (sequentially) unblock.
