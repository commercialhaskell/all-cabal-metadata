description: This is a daemon that executes an ssh command to form a secure tunnel
  and then blocks on it. If the tunnel goes down, sshtun can attempt to reestablish
  it. It can also be set up to monitor a file on an http server to determine if the
  tunnel should be up or not, so you can switch it on or off remotely.
