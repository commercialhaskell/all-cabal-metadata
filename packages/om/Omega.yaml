description: "Omega -- Operations on Presburger arithmetic formulae\n\nThis package
  contains a reduced copy of the Omega library.\nThe Omega library's home page is
  http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/omega/, and\nits full sources are at http://github.com/davewathaverford/the-omega-project/.\n\nBUILDING
  INSTRUCTIONS\n---------------------\n\nThis is a Cabal package.  The typical build
  process is:\n\n\trunhaskell Setup.hs configure <FLAGS>\n\trunhaskell Setup.hs build\n\trunhaskell
  Setup.hs install\n\nConfigure with -fUseInstalledOmega if you have already installed
  the C++\nOmega library.  Otherwise, the library will be built and linked into this\npackage.\n\nGHCi
  is not supported due to dynamic loading problems.\n\nBecause this package contains
  C++ source code, Cabal may need help\nfinding the required headers and libraries.
  \ You may need to provide the paths\nto the C++ include directory (contains STL
  headers such as \"vector\") and\nlibrary directory (contains the C runtime library,
  called \"libstdc++.so\" on\nGNU Linux systems).  If the C++ Omega library is not
  installed in a standard\nplace, you will also need to provide paths to it.\n\nA
  configuration might look something like this:\n\n\trunhaskell Setup.hs configure
  --disable-library-for-ghci -p \\\n\t\t--extra-include-dirs=$(YOUR_CXX_INCLUDE_PATH)
  \\\n\t\t--extra-lib-dirs=$(YOUR_CXX_LIB_PATH)\n\nDOCUMENTATION\n-------------\n\nThe
  C++ Omega library includes documentation of its exported interface in\n'interface.dvi'.
  \ You may wish to look there if the Haddock documentation for\na set operation or
  relation operation is lacking.\n\n"
