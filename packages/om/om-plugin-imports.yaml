  # om-plugin-imports

  This plugin behaves similarly to the native GHC options
  `-ddump-minimal-imports`. If (and only if) you specify a `-dumpdir` directory
  to GHC, this plugin will emit files to that directory that contain a
  normalized, complete set of explicit imports for your module. This is sort of
  what `-ddump-minimal-imports` does, but `-ddump-minimal-imports` has the
  following deficiencies:

  * It will not always produce output that satisfies `-Wmissing-import-lists`.
    E.g. it will sometimes produce something like:

    ```
    import Foo (Bar(..))
    ```
  * It will explicitly import all the names from modules which are already
    qualified, E.g:
    ```
    import qualified Foo as F (foo, bar, baz)
    ```

  This plugin solves these problems. It will dump
  a file in the user-supplied `-dumpdir` of the form
  `<dumpdir>/<module-name>.full-imports`. The file will contain a set of
  imports which can be copy/pasted over the imports in your module in a
  way that satisfies `-Wmissing-import-lists`.
