  # XDG Basedir implementation

  This is a compliant implementation of the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html).

  ## Compliance

  - [X] `$XDG_DATA_HOME`
    - [X] get path
    - [X] read file
    - [X] write file
  - [X] `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
    - [X] get path
    - [X] read file
    - [X] write file
  - [X] `$XDG_STATE_HOME`
    - [X] get path
    - [X] read file
    - [X] write file
  - [X] `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`
    - [X] get path list
    - [X] read best file
    - [X] merge files
  - [X] `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS`
    - [X] get path list
    - [X] read best file
    - [X] merge files
  - [X] `$XDG_CACHE_HOME`
    - [X] get path
    - [X] read file
    - [X] write file
  - [X] `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`
    - [X] get path
    - [X] read file
    - [X] write file
  - [X] treat relative paths as invalid

  As this library deals purely with accessing files, I eventually chose not to implement the notion of warning the user when `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` isn't set and of providing a replacement directory. Any application where that behaviour would be relevant can use the exception raised by `getRuntimeDir` to detect this problem, should deal with warning the user in its own context, and can set `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` with a path that makes sense for that application.

  # Build

  You can build the project with:

  ```
  hpack
  cabal build
  ```

  If you have Nix installed, `shell.nix` provides an environment with all the needed dependencies. It is suitable for `nix-direnv`.
