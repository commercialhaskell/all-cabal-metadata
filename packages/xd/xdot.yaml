description: |-
  Parse Graphviz xdot files and interactively view them using
  GTK and Cairo.

  Currently not all xdot features are supported. Nodes and
  edges can be highlighted by hovering them and clicked.

  For an example of using this library try the accompanying
  @Demo.hs@ with the dot-files in @dot-examples/@.

  This library was originally written as part of ghc-vis, but
  is now a separate project, in case anyone else may have a
  use for it.
