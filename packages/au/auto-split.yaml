description: "# auto-split \U0001F938\n\nA GHC plugin that performs automatic case
  splitting.\n\n### Usage\n\nThis plugin is intended to be used with GHCi or adjacent
  utilities such as\n`ghcid` and `ghciwatch` as a developement tool, not as a package
  dependency.\nHere is an example command for starting a REPL for a stack project
  with the\n`auto-split` plugin enabled (you may need to add `auto-split` to your\n`extra-deps`
  first):\n\n```\nstack repl my-project --package auto-split --ghci-options='-fplugin
  AutoSplit'\n```\n\nlikewise for a cabal project (you may need to run `cabal update`
  first):\n\n```\ncabal repl my-project --build-depends auto-split --repl-options='-fplugin
  AutoSplit'\n```\n\nWith the plugin enabled, use `SPLIT` in a pattern match for a
  case statement or\nfunction declaration. Compiling the module will then result in
  that pattern\nmatch being expanded to cover all missing cases.\n\nFor example, compiling
  this module\n\n```haskell\nmodule Foo where\n\nfoo :: Maybe Bool -> String\nfoo
  x = case x of\n  SPLIT -> undefined\n```\n\nresults in the module file being updated
  to\n\n```haskell\nmodule Foo where\n\nfoo :: Maybe Bool -> String\nfoo x = case
  x of\n  Just _ -> undefined\n  Nothing -> undefined\n```\n\nif the module is then
  changed to\n\n```haskell\nmodule Foo where\n\nfoo :: Maybe Bool -> String\nfoo x
  = case x of\n  Just SPLIT -> \"foo\"\n  Nothing -> \"bar\"\n```\n\ncompiling will
  result in\n\n```haskell\nmodule Foo where\n\nfoo :: Maybe Bool -> String\nfoo x
  = case x of\n  Just True -> \"foo\"\n  Just False -> \"foo\"\n  Nothing -> \"bar\"\n```\n\nThe
  `SPLIT` pattern can be used in this way anywhere a pattern match group\noccurs:
  case statements, lamba case, or function declarations.\n\nIf case splitting results
  in constructors or patterns that are not in scope,\nthey will be qualified with
  `NOT_IN_SCOPE`.\n\nCompilation will abort when case splitting occurs since the module
  file has\nbeen updated. This is done by having GHC emit a custom error. This error
  does\nnot indicate that something went wrong.\n\n### Known limitations\n\n- A module
  must pass the type checker for splitting to occur, unless the\n  `-fdefer-type-errors`
  GHC flag is used.\n- Using `SPLIT` in a pattern match will insert patterns for _all_
  missing cases\n  in the group. It doesn't restrict to the position where `SPLIT`
  is used.\n- If the pattern match where `SPLIT` is being used contains a catch-all\n
  \ wildcard case then the plugin will have no effect because there are no\n  missing
  patterns.\n- Doesn't work well with the view patterns syntax extension\n- Doesn't
  apply to code inside CPP conditional blocks\n- The plugin only supports certain
  GHC versions with the intent of supporting\n  the four latest release series, i.e.
  `9.6.*` thru `9.12.*`. The cabal file\n  indicates the currently supported versions.\n"
