  IMPORTANT! Development of AutoForms has stopped. In stead use
  WxGeneric (see
  http://lindstroem.wordpress.com/2008/05/03/introducing-wxgeneric/ )
  which is based upon AutoForms. Nonetheless, AutoForms may still a good
  resource for ideas.

  AutoForms is a library to ease the creation of Graphical User
  Interfaces (GUI). It does this by using generic programming to
  construct GUI components.

  The AutoForms user creates an ordinary algebraic data type (ADT),
  which should reflect the data model of an application. From this ADT
  AutoForms automatically constructs a GUI component, by using the
  structure and identifiers of the ADT. To facilitate this construction,
  AutoForms uses the 'Scrap your boilerplate' approach to generic
  programming.

  This component can be displayed using WxHaskell or by an AutoForms
  custom monad called WxM.. The first facilitates that people who
  already knows WxHaskell quickly will be able to make GUIs. The second
  is our attempt at a more type-safe and easier to use GUI toolkit.
