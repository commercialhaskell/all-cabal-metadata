description: |-
  This package provides functions
  for interchange with the Audacity sound signal editor.
  Currently we support import and export of label tracks,
  export of Audacity projects and
  limited import of tracks from Audacity projects.

  We provide some examples that are useful on its own:

  * @sox-split@:
  Split an audio file according to a label track.
  Audacity provides this function by itself.
  You can use placeholders like @%s@ and @%02d@
  in order to compose the names of the parts from the labels and positions.

  * @sox-concat@:
  Concatenate a sequence of sound files with matching
  sampling rates and numbers of channels using SoX
  and generate an Audacity label track file
  that shows the origins of the parts.

  * @audacity-concat@:
  Create an Audacity project file
  containing a virtual concatenation of the input sound files
  and a label track showing the origins of the sound files.

  * @audacity-combine@:
  Put several audio and label files into tracks of a new Audacity project.
  Opening one or even multiple such projects is much easier
  than loading individual tracks into Audacity.
