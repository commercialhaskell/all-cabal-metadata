description: ! "cmark-gfm-hs\n============\n\nThis package provides Haskell bindings
  for [libcmark-gfm], the reference\nparser for [GitHub Flavored Markdown], a fully
  specified variant of Markdown.\nIt includes sources for [libcmark-gfm] and does
  not require prior\ninstallation of the C library.\n\ncmark provides the following
  advantages over existing Markdown\nlibraries for Haskell:\n\n  - **Speed:** cmark
  can render a Markdown version of *War and Peace* in\n    the blink of an eye.  Conversion
  speed is on par with the\n    [sundown] library, though we were unable to benchmark
  precisely,\n    because [sundown] raised a malloc error when compiled into our\n
  \   benchmark suite. Relative to other Haskell Markdown libraries:\n    cmark was
  82 times faster than [cheapskate], 59 times faster than\n    [markdown], 105 times
  faster than [pandoc], and 3 times faster\n    than [discount].\n\n  - **Memory footprint:**
  \ Memory footprint is on par with [sundown].\n    On one sample, the library uses
  a fourth the memory that [markdown]\n    uses, and less than a tenth the memory
  that [pandoc] uses.\n\n  - **Robustness:**  cmark can handle whatever is thrown
  at it,\n    without the exponential blowups in parsing time that sometimes afflict\n
  \   other libraries.  (The input `bench/full-sample.md`,\n    for example, causes
  both [pandoc] and [markdown] to grind to a\n    halt.)  [libcmark-gfm] has been
  extensively fuzz-tested.\n\n  - **Accuracy:**  cmark passes the CommonMark spec's
  suite of over\n    600 conformance tests.\n\n  - **Standardization:**  Since there
  is a spec and a comprehensive suite\n    of tests, we can have a high degree of
  confidence that any two\n    CommonMark implementations will behave the same.  Thus,
  for\n    example, one could use this library for server-side rendering\n    and
  [commonmark.js] for client-side previewing.\n\n  - **Multiple renderers.**  Output
  in HTML, groff man, LaTeX, CommonMark,\n    and a custom XML format is supported.
  And it is easy to write new\n    renderers to support other formats.\n\n  - **Ease
  of installation:** cmark is portable and has minimal\n    dependencies.\n\ncmark
  does not provide Haskell versions of the whole [libcmark-gfm]\nAPI, which is built
  around mutable `cmark_node` objects.  Instead, it\nprovides functions for converting
  CommonMark to HTML (and other\nformats), and a function for converting CommonMark
  to a `Node`\ntree that can be processed further using Haskell.\n\n**A note on security:**
  \ This library does not attempt to sanitize\nHTML output.  We recommend using [xss-sanitize]
  to filter the output,\nor enabling `optSafe` to filter out all raw HTML and potentially\ndangerous
  URLs.\n\n**A note on stability:**  There is a good chance the API will change\nsignificantly
  after this early release.\n\n[GitHub Flavored Markdown]: https://github.github.com/gfm/\n[libcmark-gfm]:
