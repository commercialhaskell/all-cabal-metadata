  # CmdArgs: Easy Command Line Processing [![Hackage version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/cmdargs.svg?label=Hackage)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cmdargs) [![Stackage version](https://www.stackage.org/package/cmdargs/badge/nightly?label=Stackage)](https://www.stackage.org/package/cmdargs) [![Build status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/ndmitchell/cmdargs/ci.svg)](https://github.com/ndmitchell/cmdargs/actions)

  CmdArgs is a Haskell library for defining command line parsers. The two features that make it a better choice than the standard [getopt library](http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/System-Console-GetOpt.html) are:

  * It's very concise to use. The HLint command line handling is three times shorter with CmdArgs.
  * It supports programs with multiple modes, such as [darcs](http://darcs.net) or [Cabal](http://haskell.org/cabal/).

  A very simple example of a command line processor is:
  ```haskell
  data Sample = Sample {hello :: String} deriving (Show, Data, Typeable)

  sample = Sample{hello = def &= help "World argument" &= opt "world"}
           &= summary "Sample v1"

  main = print =<< cmdArgs sample
  ```
  Despite being very concise, this processor is already fairly well featured:

      $ runhaskell Sample.hs --hello=world
      Sample {hello = "world"}

      $ runhaskell Sample.hs --help
      Sample v1, (C) Neil Mitchell 2009

      sample [FLAG]

        -? --help[=FORMAT]  Show usage information (optional format)
        -V --version        Show version information
        -v --verbose        Higher verbosity
        -q --quiet          Lower verbosity
        -h --hello=VALUE    World argument (default=world)

  ## User Manual

  The rest of this document explains how to write the "hello world" of command line processors, then how to extend it with features into a complex command line processor. Finally this document gives three samples, which the `cmdargs` program can run. The three samples are:

  * `hlint` - the [HLint](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint#readme) program.
  * `diffy` - a program to compare the differences between directories.
  * `maker` - a make style program.

  For each example you are encouraged to look at it's source (in the [repo](https://github.com/ndmitchell/cmdargs/tree/master/System/Console/CmdArgs/Test/Implicit)) and run it (try `cmdargs hlint --help`). The HLint program is fairly standard in terms of it's argument processing, and previously used the [System.Console.GetOpt](http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/System-Console-GetOpt.html) library. Using GetOpt required 90 lines and a reasonable amount of duplication. Using CmdArgs the code requires 30 lines, and the logic is much simpler.

  **Acknowledgements** Thanks to Kevin Quick for substantial patches, and additional code contributions from Sebastian Fischer and Daniel Schoepe.


  ## Hello World Example

  The following code defines a complete command line argument processor:
  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE DeriveDataTypeable #-}
  {-# OPTIONS_GHC -fno-cse #-}
  module Sample where
  import System.Console.CmdArgs

  data Sample = Sample {hello :: String}
                deriving (Show, Data, Typeable)

  sample = Sample{hello = def}

  main = print =<< cmdArgs sample
  ```
  To use the CmdArgs library there are three steps:

  * Define a record data type (`Sample`) that contains a field for each argument. This type needs to have instances for `Show`, `Data` and `Typeable`.
  * Give a value of that type (`sample`) with default values (`def` is a default value of any type, but I could also have written `""`). This value is turned into a command line by calling the `cmdArgs` function.
  * To ensure GHC evalutes attributes the right number of times we disable the CSE optimisation on this module.

  Now we have a reasonably functional command line argument processor. Some sample interactions are:

      $ runhaskell Sample.hs --hello=world
      Sample {hello = "world"}

      $ runhaskell Sample.hs --version
      The sample program

      $ runhaskell Sample.hs --help
      The sample program

      sample [OPTIONS]

        -? --help        Display help message
        -V --version     Print version information
        -h --hello=ITEM

  CmdArgs uses defaults to automatically infer a command line parser for a value, and provides annotations to override any of the the defaults. CmdArgs automatically supports `--help` and `--version` flags, and optionally supports verbosity flags.

  ## Specifying Attributes

  In order to control the behaviour we can add attributes. For example to add an attribute specifying the help text for the `--hello` argument we can write:
  ```haskell
  sample = Sample{hello = def &= help "Who to say hello to"}
  ```
  We can add additional attributes, for example to specify the type of the value expected by hello:
  ```haskell
  sample = Sample {hello = def &= help "Who to say hello to" &= typ "WORLD"}
  ```
  Now when running `--help` the final line is:

        -h --hello=WORLD  Who to say hello to

  There are many more attributes, detailed in the [Haddock documentation](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/cmdargs/latest/doc/html/System-Console-CmdArgs.html#2).


  ## Multiple Modes

  To specify a program with multiple modes, similar to [darcs](http://darcs.net/), we can supply a data type with multiple constructors, for example:
  ```haskell
  data Sample = Hello {whom :: String}
              | Goodbye
                deriving (Show, Data, Typeable)

  hello = Hello{whom = def}
  goodbye = Goodbye

  main = print =<< cmdArgs (modes [hello,goodbye])
  ```
  Compared to the first example, we now have multiple constructors, and a sample value for each constructor is passed to `cmdArgs`. Some sample interactions with this command line are:

      $ runhaskell Sample.hs hello --whom=world
      Hello {whom = "world"}

      $ runhaskell Sample.hs goodbye
      Goodbye

      $ runhaskell Sample.hs --help
      The sample program

      sample [OPTIONS]

       Common flags
        -? --help       Display help message
        -V --version    Print version information

      sample hello [OPTIONS]

        -w --whom=ITEM

      sample goodbye [OPTIONS]

  As before, the behaviour can be customised using attributes.


  ## Larger Examples

  For each of the following examples we first explain the purpose of the program, then give the source code, and finally the output of `--help`. The programs are intended to show sample uses of CmdArgs, and are available to experiment with through `cmdargs progname`.

  ### HLint

  The [HLint](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint#readme) program analyses a list of files, using various options to control the analysis. The command line processing is simple, but a few interesting points are:

  * The `--report` flag can be used to output a report in a standard location, but giving the flag a value changes where the file is output.
  * The `color` field is assigned two flag aliases, `--colour` and `-c`. Assigning the `-c` short flag explicitly stops either of the CPP fields using it.
  * The `show_` field would clash with `show` if given the expected name, but CmdArgs automatically strips the trailing underscore.
  * The `cpp_define` field has an underscore in it's name, which is transformed into a hyphen for the flag name.

  The code is:
  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE DeriveDataTypeable #-}
  module HLint where
  import System.Console.CmdArgs

  data HLint = HLint
      {report :: [FilePath]
      ,hint :: [FilePath]
      ,color :: Bool
      ,ignore_ :: [String]
      ,show_ :: Bool
      ,extension :: [String]
      ,language :: [String]
      ,utf8 :: Bool
      ,encoding :: String
      ,find :: [FilePath]
      ,test_ :: Bool
      ,datadir :: [FilePath]
      ,cpp_define :: [String]
      ,cpp_include :: [FilePath]
      ,files :: [FilePath]
      }
      deriving (Data,Typeable,Show,Eq)

  hlint = HLint
      {report = def &= opt "report.html" &= typFile &= help "Generate a report in HTML"
      ,hint = def &= typFile &= help "Hint/ignore file to use"
      ,color = def &= name "c" &= name "colour" &= help "Color the output (requires ANSI terminal)"
      ,ignore_ = def &= typ "MESSAGE" &= help "Ignore a particular hint"
      ,show_ = def &= help "Show all ignored ideas"
      ,extension = def &= typ "EXT" &= help "File extensions to search (defaults to hs and lhs)"
      ,language = def &= name "X" &= typ "LANG" &= help "Language extension (Arrows, NoCPP)"
      ,utf8 = def &= help "Use UTF-8 text encoding"
      ,encoding = def &= typ "ENC" &= help "Choose the text encoding"
      ,find = def &= typFile &= help "Find hints in a Haskell file"
      ,test_ = def &= help "Run in test mode"
      ,datadir = def &= typDir &= help "Override the data directory"
      ,cpp_define = def &= typ "NAME[=VALUE]" &= help "CPP #define"
      ,cpp_include = def &= typDir &= help "CPP include path"
      ,files = def &= args &= typ "FILES/DIRS"
      } &=
      verbosity &=
      help "Suggest improvements to Haskell source code" &=
      summary "HLint v0.0.0, (C) Neil Mitchell" &=
      details ["Hlint gives hints on how to improve Haskell code",""
              ,"To check all Haskell files in 'src' and generate a report type:","  hlint src --report"]

  mode = cmdArgsMode hlint
  ```
  Produces the `--help` output:

      HLint v0.0.0, (C) Neil Mitchell

      hlint [OPTIONS] [FILES/DIRS]
      Suggest improvements to Haskell source code

      Common flags:
        -r --report[=FILE]            Generate a report in HTML
        -h --hint=FILE                Hint/ignore file to use
        -c --colour --color            Color the output (requires ANSI terminal)
        -i --ignore=MESSAGE            Ignore a particular hint
        -s --show                     Show all ignored ideas
           --extension=EXT            File extensions to search (defaults to hs and lhs)
        -X --language=LANG            Language extension (Arrows, NoCPP)
        -u --utf8                        Use UTF-8 text encoding
           --encoding=ENC                Choose the text encoding
        -f --find=FILE                Find hints in a Haskell file
        -t --test                        Run in test mode
        -d --datadir=DIR                Override the data directory
           --cpp-define=NAME[=VALUE]  CPP #define
           --cpp-include=DIR            CPP include path
        -? --help                        Display help message
        -V --version                    Print version information
        -v --verbose                    Loud verbosity
        -q --quiet                    Quiet verbosity

      Hlint gives hints on how to improve Haskell code

      To check all Haskell files in 'src' and generate a report type:
        hlint src --report


  ### Diffy

  The Diffy sample is a based on the idea of creating directory listings and comparing them. The tool can operate in two separate modes, `create` or `diff`. This sample is fictional, but the ideas are drawn from a real program. A few notable features:

  * There are multiple modes of execution, creating and diffing.
  * The diff mode takes exactly two arguments, the old file and the new file.
  * Default values are given for the `out` field, which are different in both modes.

  The code is:
  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE DeriveDataTypeable #-}
  module Diffy where
  import System.Console.CmdArgs

  data Diffy = Create {src :: Maybe FilePath, out :: FilePath}
             | Diff {old :: FilePath, new :: FilePath, out :: FilePath}
               deriving (Data,Typeable,Show,Eq)

  outFlags x = x &= help "Output file" &= typFile

  create = Create
      {src = def &= help "Source directory" &= typDir
      ,out = outFlags "ls.txt"
      } &= help "Create a fingerprint"

  diff = Diff
      {old = def &= typ "OLDFILE" &= argPos 0
      ,new = def &= typ "NEWFILE" &= argPos 1
      ,out = outFlags "diff.txt"
      } &= help "Perform a diff"

  mode = cmdArgsMode $ modes [create,diff] &= help "Create and compare differences" &= program "diffy" &= summary "Diffy v1.0"
  ```
  And `--help` produces:

      Diffy v1.0

      diffy [COMMAND] ... [OPTIONS]
        Create and compare differences

      Common flags:
        -o --out=FILE     Output file
        -? --help         Display help message
        -V --version     Print version information

      diffy create [OPTIONS]
        Create a fingerprint

        -s  --src=DIR  Source directory

      diffy diff [OPTIONS] OLDFILE NEWFILE
        Perform a diff

  ### Maker

  The Maker sample is based around a build system, where we can either build a project, clean the temporary files, or run a test. Some interesting features are:

  * The build mode is the default, so `maker` on it's own will be interpreted as a build command.
  * The build method is an enumeration.
  * The `threads` field is in two of the constructors, but not all three. It is given the short flag `-j`, rather than the default `-t`.

  The code is:
  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE DeriveDataTypeable #-}
  module Maker where
  import System.Console.CmdArgs

  data Method = Debug | Release | Profile
                deriving (Data,Typeable,Show,Eq)

  data Maker
      = Wipe
      | Test {threads :: Int, extra :: [String]}
