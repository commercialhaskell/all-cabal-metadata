description: ! "# CmdArgs: Easy Command Line Processing [![Hackage version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/cmdargs.svg?label=Hackage)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cmdargs)
  [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/ndmitchell/cmdargs.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ndmitchell/cmdargs)\n\nCmdArgs
  is a Haskell library for defining command line parsers. The two features that make
  it a better choice than the standard [getopt library](http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/System-Console-GetOpt.html)
  are:\n\n* It's very concise to use. The HLint command line handling is three times
  shorter with CmdArgs.\n* It supports programs with multiple modes, such as [darcs](http://darcs.net)
  or [Cabal](http://haskell.org/cabal/).\n\nA very simple example of a command line
  processor is:\n```haskell\ndata Sample = Sample {hello :: String} deriving (Show,
  Data, Typeable)\n\nsample = Sample{hello = def &= help \"World argument\" &= opt
  \"world\"}\n         &= summary \"Sample v1\"\n\nmain = print =<< cmdArgs sample\n```\nDespite
  being very concise, this processor is already fairly well featured:\n\n    $ runhaskell
  Sample.hs --hello=world\n    Sample {hello = \"world\"}\n\n    $ runhaskell Sample.hs
  --help\n    Sample v1, (C) Neil Mitchell 2009\n\n    sample [FLAG]\n\n      -? --help[=FORMAT]
  \ Show usage information (optional format)\n      -V --version        Show version
  information\n      -v --verbose        Higher verbosity\n      -q --quiet          Lower
  verbosity\n      -h --hello=VALUE    World argument (default=world)\n\n## User Manual\n\nThe
  rest of this document explains how to write the \"hello world\" of command line
  processors, then how to extend it with features into a complex command line processor.
  Finally this document gives three samples, which the `cmdargs` program can run.
  The three samples are:\n\n* `hlint` - the [HLint](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint#readme)
  program.\n* `diffy` - a program to compare the differences between directories.\n*
  `maker` - a make style program.\n\nFor each example you are encouraged to look at
  it's source (in the [repo](https://github.com/ndmitchell/cmdargs/tree/master/System/Console/CmdArgs/Test/Implicit))
  and run it (try `cmdargs hlint --help`). The HLint program is fairly standard in
  terms of it's argument processing, and previously used the [System.Console.GetOpt](http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/System-Console-GetOpt.html)
  library. Using GetOpt required 90 lines and a reasonable amount of duplication.
  Using CmdArgs the code requires 30 lines, and the logic is much simpler.\n\n**Acknowledgements**
  Thanks to Kevin Quick for substantial patches, and additional code contributions
  from Sebastian Fischer and Daniel Schoepe.\n\n\n## Hello World Example\n\nThe following
  code defines a complete command line argument processor:\n```haskell\n{-# LANGUAGE
  DeriveDataTypeable #-}\n{-# OPTIONS_GHC -fno-cse #-}\nmodule Sample where\nimport
  System.Console.CmdArgs\n\ndata Sample = Sample {hello :: String}\n              deriving
  (Show, Data, Typeable)\n\nsample = Sample{hello = def}\n\nmain = print =<< cmdArgs
  sample\n```\nTo use the CmdArgs library there are three steps:\n\n* Define a record
  data type (`Sample`) that contains a field for each argument. This type needs to
  have instances for `Show`, `Data` and `Typeable`.\n* Give a value of that type (`sample`)
  with default values (`def` is a default value of any type, but I could also have
  written `\"\"`). This value is turned into a command line by calling the `cmdArgs`
  function.\n* To ensure GHC evalutes attributes the right number of times we disable
  the CSE optimisation on this module.\n\nNow we have a reasonably functional command
  line argument processor. Some sample interactions are:\n\n    $ runhaskell Sample.hs
  --hello=world\n    Sample {hello = \"world\"}\n\n    $ runhaskell Sample.hs --version\n
  \   The sample program\n\n    $ runhaskell Sample.hs --help\n    The sample program\n\n
  \   sample [OPTIONS]\n\n      -? --help        Display help message\n      -V --version
  \    Print version information\n      -h --hello=ITEM\n\nCmdArgs uses defaults to
  automatically infer a command line parser for a value, and provides annotations
  to override any of the the defaults. CmdArgs automatically supports `--help` and
  `--version` flags, and optionally supports verbosity flags.\n\n## Specifying Attributes\n\nIn
  order to control the behaviour we can add attributes. For example to add an attribute
  specifying the help text for the `--hello` argument we can write:\n```haskell\nsample
  = Sample{hello = def &= help \"Who to say hello to\"}\n```\nWe can add additional
  attributes, for example to specify the type of the value expected by hello:\n```haskell\nsample
  = Sample {hello = def &= help \"Who to say hello to\" &= typ \"WORLD\"}\n```\nNow
  when running `--help` the final line is:\n\n      -h --hello=WORLD  Who to say hello
  to\n\nThere are many more attributes, detailed in the [Haddock documentation](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/cmdargs/latest/doc/html/System-Console-CmdArgs.html#2).\n\n\n##
  Multiple Modes\n\nTo specify a program with multiple modes, similar to [darcs](http://darcs.net/),
  we can supply a data type with multiple constructors, for example:\n```haskell\ndata
  Sample = Hello {whom :: String}\n            | Goodbye\n              deriving (Show,
  Data, Typeable)\n\nhello = Hello{whom = def}\ngoodbye = Goodbye\n\nmain = print
  =<< cmdArgs (modes [hello,goodbye])\n```\nCompared to the first example, we now
  have multiple constructors, and a sample value for each constructor is passed to
  `cmdArgs`. Some sample interactions with this command line are:\n\n    $ runhaskell
  Sample.hs hello --whom=world\n    Hello {whom = \"world\"}\n\n    $ runhaskell Sample.hs
  goodbye\n    Goodbye\n\n    $ runhaskell Sample.hs --help\n    The sample program\n\n
  \   sample [OPTIONS]\n\n     Common flags\n      -? --help       Display help message\n
  \     -V --version    Print version information\n\n    sample hello [OPTIONS]\n\n
  \     -w --whom=ITEM\n\n    sample goodbye [OPTIONS]\n\nAs before, the behaviour
  can be customised using attributes.\n\n\n## Larger Examples\n\nFor each of the following
  examples we first explain the purpose of the program, then give the source code,
  and finally the output of `--help`. The programs are intended to show sample uses
  of CmdArgs, and are available to experiment with through `cmdargs progname`.\n\n###
  HLint\n\nThe [HLint](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint#readme) program analyses
  a list of files, using various options to control the analysis. The command line
  processing is simple, but a few interesting points are:\n\n* The `--report` flag
  can be used to output a report in a standard location, but giving the flag a value
  changes where the file is output.\n* The `color` field is assigned two flag aliases,
  `--colour` and `-c`. Assigning the `-c` short flag explicitly stops either of the
  CPP fields using it.\n* The `show_` field would clash with `show` if given the expected
  name, but CmdArgs automatically strips the trailing underscore.\n* The `cpp_define`
  field has an underscore in it's name, which is transformed into a hyphen for the
  flag name.\n\nThe code is:\n```haskell\n{-# LANGUAGE DeriveDataTypeable #-}\nmodule
  HLint where\nimport System.Console.CmdArgs\n\ndata HLint = HLint\n    {report ::

  verbosity\n      -q --quiet                    Quiet verbosity\n\n    Hlint gives
  hints on how to improve Haskell code\n\n    To check all Haskell files in 'src'
  and generate a report type:\n      hlint src --report\n\n\n### Diffy\n\nThe Diffy
  sample is a based on the idea of creating directory listings and comparing them.
  The tool can operate in two separate modes, `create` or `diff`. This sample is fictional,
  but the ideas are drawn from a real program. A few notable features:\n\n* There
  are multiple modes of execution, creating and diffing.\n* The diff mode takes exactly
  two arguments, the old file and the new file.\n* Default values are given for the
  `out` field, which are different in both modes.\n\nThe code is:\n```haskell\n{-#
  LANGUAGE DeriveDataTypeable #-}\nmodule Diffy where\nimport System.Console.CmdArgs\n\ndata
  Diffy = Create {src :: Maybe FilePath, out :: FilePath}\n           | Diff {old
  :: FilePath, new :: FilePath, out :: FilePath}\n             deriving (Data,Typeable,Show,Eq)\n\noutFlags
  x = x &= help \"Output file\" &= typFile\n\ncreate = Create\n    {src = def &= help
  \"Source directory\" &= typDir\n    ,out = outFlags \"ls.txt\"\n    } &= help \"Create
  a fingerprint\"\n\ndiff = Diff\n    {old = def &= typ \"OLDFILE\" &= argPos 0\n
  \   ,new = def &= typ \"NEWFILE\" &= argPos 1\n    ,out = outFlags \"diff.txt\"\n
  \   } &= help \"Perform a diff\"\n\nmode = cmdArgsMode $ modes [create,diff] &=
  help \"Create and compare differences\" &= program \"diffy\" &= summary \"Diffy
  v1.0\"\n```\nAnd `--help` produces:\n\n    Diffy v1.0\n\n    diffy [COMMAND] ...
  [OPTIONS]\n      Create and compare differences\n\n    Common flags:\n      -o --out=FILE
  \    Output file\n      -? --help         Display help message\n      -V --version
  \    Print version information\n\n    diffy create [OPTIONS]\n      Create a fingerprint\n\n
  \     -s  --src=DIR  Source directory\n\n    diffy diff [OPTIONS] OLDFILE NEWFILE\n
  \     Perform a diff\n\n### Maker\n\nThe Maker sample is based around a build system,
  where we can either build a project, clean the temporary files, or run a test. Some
  interesting features are:\n\n* The build mode is the default, so `maker` on it's
  own will be interpreted as a build command.\n* The build method is an enumeration.\n*
  The `threads` field is in two of the constructors, but not all three. It is given
  the short flag `-j`, rather than the default `-t`.\n\nThe code is:\n```haskell\n{-#
  LANGUAGE DeriveDataTypeable #-}\nmodule Maker where\nimport System.Console.CmdArgs\n\ndata
