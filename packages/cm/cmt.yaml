  # cmt

  Write consistent git commit messages

  ## Install

  [Binaries for Mac and Linux are available](https://github.com/smallhadroncollider/cmt/releases). Add the binary to a directory in your path (such as `/usr/local/bin`).

  ### Cabal

  **Requirements**: [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/)

  ```bash
  cabal install cmt
  ```

  Make sure you run `cabal update` if you haven't run it recently.

  ### Building

  **Requirements**: [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)

  The following command will build cmt and then install it in `~/.local/bin`:

  ```bash
  stack build && stack install
  ```


  ## Usage

  Add a `.cmt` file to your project directory.

  ```bash
  cmt # will show the options and then commit
  ```

  If you're using the `${*}` format option then:

  ```bash
  cmt "blah blah blah" # this will go in ${*} place
  ```

  ### Format

  A `.cmt` file consist of two parts: the input parts and the output format.

  For example, the [AngularJS Commit Message Guidelines](https://gist.github.com/stephenparish/9941e89d80e2bc58a153):

  ```txt
  # The input parts
  {
      # Shows a list of options
      "Type" = [
          "feat",
          "fix",
          "docs",
          "style",
          "refactor",
          "test",
          "chore"
      ]
      "Scope" = @ # Allows a single line of input
      "Subject" = @
      "Body" = !@ # Allows multi-line input
      "Footer" = !@
  }

  # The output format
  # Takes the values provided from the input stage
  # and interpolates them in
  ${Type} (${Scope}): ${Subject}

  ${Body}

  ${Footer}
  ```


  #### Input Parts

  These are at the top of the `.cmt` file and surrounded by opening and closing curly braces. A consist of a name and a type:

  - `@`: single line input
  - `!@`: multi line input
  - `["option 1", "option 2"]`: list of options

  #### Output Format

  The output format consists of named input parts plus anything else you want.

  You can accept a output called `${*}`, which will add in whatever is passed to `cmt` as command line arguments.

  For example:

  ```txt
  # Input parts
  # * input not needed, as comes from command-line
  {
      "Scope" = @
  }

  # Scope from input and * from command-line
  (${Scope}): ${*}
  ```

  Then use with:

  ```bash
  cmt "Blah blah blah"
  ```
