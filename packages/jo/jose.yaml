  ## Version 0.12 (2025-08-18)

  - GHC 9.6 is now the earliest supported version.

  - Changed the header protection data types for better ergonomics
    ([#125](https://github.com/frasertweedale/hs-jose/issues/125)).
    Previously, `()` was used for serialisations that only support
    protected headers (thus, a single constructor).  This release
    introduces the new singleton data type `RequiredProtected` to
    replace the use of `()` for this purpose.  This is a breaking
    change and some library users will need to update their code.

    The `Protection` type has been renamed to `OptionalProtection`,
    with the old name retained as a (deprecated) type synonym.

    The `ProtectionIndicator` class has been renamed to
    `ProtectionSupport`, with the old name retained as a (deprecated)
    type synonym.

    Added some convenience header and header parameter constructors:
    `newJWSHeaderProtected`, `newHeaderParamProtected` and
    `newHeaderParamUnprotected`.

  - Generalised the types of `signJWT`, `verifyJWT` and related
    functions to accept custom JWS header types.  Added new type
    synonym `SignedJWTWithHeader h`.  This change could break some
    applications by introducing ambiguity.  The solution is to use
    a type annotation, type application, or explicit coercion
    function, as in the below examples:

    ```haskell
    -- type application
    {-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications #-}
    decodeCompact @SignedJWT s >>= verifyClaims settings k

    -- type annotation
    do
      jwt <- decodeCompact s
      verifyClaims settings k (jwt :: SignedJWT)

    -- coercion function
    let
      fixType = id :: SignedJWT -> SignedJWT
    in
      verifyClaims settings k . fixType =<< decodeCompact s
    ```

  - Added `unsafeGetPayload`, `unsafeGetJWTPayload` and
    `unsafeGetJWTClaimsSet` functions.  These enable access to
    the JWS/JWT payload without cryptographic verification.  As
    the name implies, these should be used with the utmost caution!
    ([#126](https://github.com/frasertweedale/hs-jose/issues/126))

  - Add `Crypto.JOSE.JWK.negotiateJWSAlg` which chooses the
    cryptographically strongest JWS algorithm for a given key,
    restricted to a given set of algorithms.  ([#118][])

  - Added new conversion functions `Crypto.JOSE.JWK.fromX509PubKey`
    and `Crypto.JOSE.JWK.fromX509PrivKey`.  These convert from the
    `Data.X509.PubKey` and `Data.X509.PrivKey` types, which can be
    read via the *crypton-x509-store* package.  They supports RSA,
    NIST ECC, and Edwards curve key types (Ed25519, Ed448, X25519,
    X448).

  - Updated `Crypto.JOSE.JWK.fromX509Certificate` to support Edwards
    curve key types (Ed25519, Ed448, X25519, X448).

  - Added `Crypto.JOSE.JWK.fromRSAPublic :: RSA.PublicKey -> JWK`.

  - Added `Ord` instance for `StringOrURI` ([#134]; contributed by
    Chris Penner).

  - Added `Semigroup` and `Monoid` instances for `JWKSet`
    ([#135]; contributed by Torgeir Strand Henriksen).

  ## Version 0.11 (2023-10-31)

  - Migrate to the *crypton* library ecosystem.  *crypton* was a hard
    fork of *cryptonite*, which was no longer maintained.  With this
    change, the minimum supported version of GHC increased to 8.8.
    There are no other notable changes in this release.

  - The `v0.10` series is the last release series to support
    *cryptonite*.  It will continue to receive important bug fixes
    until the end of 2024.


  ## Version 0.10 (2022-09-01)

  - Introduce `newtype JOSE e m a` which behaves like `ExceptT e m a`
    but also has `instance (MonadRandom m) => MonadRandom (JOSE e m)`.
    The orphan `MonadRandom` instances were removed. ([#91][])

  - Parameterise `JWT` over the claims data type.  This is a
    cleaner mechanism to support applications that use additional
    claims beyond those registered by RFC 7519.  `unregisteredClaims`
    and `addClaim` are deprecated and will be removed in a future
    release. ([#39][])

  - Add Ed448 and X448 support. ([#74][])

  - Add secp256k1 curve support (RFC 8812).

  - Added `checkJWK :: (MonadError e m, AsError e) => JWK -> m ()`.
    This action performs some key usability checks.  In particular
    it identifies too-small symmetric keys.  ([#46][])

  - Removed `QuickCheck` instances.  *jose* no longer depends on
    `QuickCheck`.  ([#106][])

  - Removed orphan `ToJSON` and `FromJSON` instances for `URI`.

  - Fail signature verification when curve does not match algorithm.
    This is an additional defence against curve substitution attacks.

  - Improved error reporting when constructing a JWK from an X.509
    certificate with ECDSA key.

  - Make compatible with `mtl == 2.3.*` ([#107][])

  - Make compatible with `monad-time == 0.4`

  # jose - JSON Object Signing and Encryption & JWT (JSON Web Token)

  *jose* is a Haskell implementation of [JSON Object Signing and
  Encryption (JOSE)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/) and [JSON
  Web Token (JWT)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519).

  The JSON Web Signature (JWS; RFC 7515) implementation is complete.
  JSON Web Encryption (JWE; RFC 7516) is not yet implemented.

  **EdDSA** signatures (RFC 8037) and secp256k1 signatures (RFC 8812)
  are supported.

  JWK Thumbprint (RFC 7638) is supported.

  [Contributions](#contributing) are welcome.

  ## Security

  If you discover a security issue in this library, please email me
  the details, ideally with a proof of concept (`frase @ frase.id.au`
  ; [PGP key](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x4B5390524111E1E2)).

  Before reporting an issue, please note the following known
  vulnerabilities:

  - The **ECDSA** implementation is vulnerable to **timing attacks** and
    should therefore only be used for verification.

  and the following known **not-vulnerabilities**:

  - The library is not vulnerable to [JWS **algorithm substitution
    attacks**](
    https://auth0.com/blog/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/).
    Haskell's type system excludes this attack.

  - The default JWS validation settings reject the **`"none"`
    algorithm**, as [required by RFC 7518](
    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-3.6).

  - The library is not vulnerable to ECDH [**invalid curve attacks**](
    https://blogs.adobe.com/security/2017/03/critical-vulnerability-uncovered-in-json-encryption.html)
    because JWE is not implemented.


  ## Interoperability issues

  The following known interoperability issues will not be addressed,
  so please do not open issues:

  - Some JOSE tools and libraries permit the use of **short keys**, in
    violation of the RFCs.  This implementation rejects JWS or JWT
    objects minted with short keys, as required by the RFCs.

  - The *Auth0* software produces objects with an [invalid `"x5t"`
    parameter](
    https://community.auth0.com/questions/7227/certificate-thumbprint-is-longer-than-20-bytes).
    The datum [should be a base64url-encoded SHA-1 digest](
    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#section-4.1.7), but *Auth0*
    produces a base64url-encoded hex-encoded SHA-1 digest.  The object
    can be repaired
    ([example](https://github.com/frasertweedale/hs-jose/issues/54#issuecomment-356460452))
    so that this library will admit it, unless the offending parameter
    is part of the *JWS Protected Header* in which case you are out of
    luck (until *Auth0* bring their implementation into compliance).

  - JWKs with leading null bytes in the RSA `"n"` parameter (a
    [violation of RFC
    7518](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-2)) have been
    [seen in the
    wild](https://github.com/frasertweedale/hs-jose/issues/68).  This
    library rejects nonconformant JWKs.  If you know which
    programs/libraries produce such objects, please file bugs against
    them.  It is straightforward to repair these keys:
    base64url-decode the offending parameter, drop the leading null
    byte, base64url-encode again then update the JSON object.


  ## Contributing

  examples and documentation are welcome.
