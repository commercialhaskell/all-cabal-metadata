  # Revision history for jordan

  ## 0.2.0.0 - 2022-07-04

  * Removed support for serializing to `Text`.
  * Removed support for parsing via Megaparsec.
  * Added support for parsing directly to a value or an error report, via a custom unbox-sum-based parser type.
  * Added `parseFieldWithDefault`.
  * Added `serializeJust`.
  * Changed the methods of `JSONObjectSerializer` and `JSONTupleSerializer` to be more consistent with the rest of the library.
  * Got rid of mandatory identifiers for object parsers.
  * Got rid of mandatory identifiers for object serializers.
  * Improved Generic Deriving Mechanisms.
  * Lots of optimizations.

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- ???

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.
  * I forgot to document this originally.

description: |-
  Jordan provides an abstract interface for converting to or from JSON.
  This interface can be used to construct various parsers and serilaizers.
  Because everything is kept abstract and inspectable, documentation can be
  automatically generated as well.

  Jordan's built-in parsers and serializers include variants that do not construct
  intermediate datatypes, which can avoid some collision-based denial of service
  attacks that have effected other libraries. They should also be more efficient
  due to the need to avoid early conversion of types, although I have not measured
  this.

  Jordan is somewhat experimental but well-tested.
