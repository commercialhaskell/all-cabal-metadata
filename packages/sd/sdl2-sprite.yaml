description: ! "# sdl2-sprite\n\nCreate a horizontal sprite like this:\n\n![](img/blue-fish-sprite.png)\n\nThe
  size of the intended result image is 220x130, so provide that:\n\n    sdl2-sprite
  blue-fish.png 220x130 --fps 15\n\nThis will open a window animating that sprite:\n\n![](img/blue-fish.gif)\n\n(Note:
  this is a screenflow recording of the animation manually edited\nto repeat, so it's
  not as smooth as in reality.)\n\nThe animation repeats indefinitely at the desired
  framerate.\n\n## Using Haskell API\n\nUse `load` to load in a sprite for a `Renderer`:\n\n```
  haskell\nload :: MonadIO m => Renderer -> FilePath -> V2 CInt -> m Sprite\n```\n\nTo
  render the sprite at a given position use `render`:\n\n``` haskell\nrender :: MonadIO
  m => Sprite -> V2 CInt -> m ()\n```\n\nTo advance the sprite's frame to the next
  frame (or loop), use\n`animate`:\n\n``` haskell\nanimate :: Sprite -> Sprite\n```\n\nThis
  is a pure function, so you can use it in a loop. See the source\nin `app/Main.hs`
  of this repository for an example.\n\n\n## How to make sprites in Inkscape\n\nChoose
  the size of your intended result e.g. 220x130 and then setup\nthe grid in Inkscape
  to show that size (see the Spacing X/Spacing Y\nfields):\n\n![](img/inkscape-doc-properties.png)\n\nIt'll
  look like this, which is handy:\n\n![](img/inkscape-grid.png)\n\nWhen you want to
  make a new frame, use `Ctrl-D` to duplicate the\nselection and use the Transform
  tool to move it exactly 220 pixels to\nthe right and hit Apply.\n\n![](img/inkscape-transform.png)\n\nMake
  sure that your document dimensions are your width x your frame\ncount.\n\nFinally,
  export your image with the right \"Image size\" - make sure the\nsize is 130 so
  that the width scales right:\n\n![](img/inkscape-export.png)\n\nNow you're good
  to go! Hit Export.\n"
