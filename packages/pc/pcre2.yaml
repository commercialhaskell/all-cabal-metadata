  # Changelog and Acknowledgements

  ## 1.0.2
  * Fixed [#4](https://github.com/sjshuck/pcre2/4), where multiple named captures
    were not type-indexed correctly.
  * Established automated builds using Github Workflows.  Thanks amesgen!

  ## 1.0.1.1
  * Temporarily eliminate all dependency version bounds to get it building on
    Hackage.

  ## 1.0.1
  * Fixed [#1](https://github.com/sjshuck/pcre2/1), where building on Windows
    would succeed but not run.  Thanks Andrew!
  * Try to adjust dependency version bounds to get it building on Hackage.  Thanks
    snoyberg!

  ## 1.0.0
  * Initial release.

description: "# pcre2\n\n![CI](https://github.com/sjshuck/hs-pcre2/workflows/CI/badge.svg)\n[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/pcre2)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pcre2)\n\nRegular
  expressions for Haskell.  \n\n## Teasers\n```haskell\nembeddedLicensePlate :: Text
  -> Maybe Text\nembeddedLicensePlate = match \"[A-Z]{3}[0-9]{3,4}\"\n```\n```haskell\ncase
  \"The quick brown fox\" of\n    [regex|brown\\s+(?<animal>\\S+)|] -> Text.putStrLn
  animal\n    _                               -> error \"nothing brown\"\n```\n```haskell\nlet
  kv'd = lined . packed . [_regex|^\\s*(.*?)\\s*[=:]\\s*(.*)|]\n\nforMOf kv'd file
  $ execStateT $ do\n    k <- gets $ capture @1\n    v <- gets $ capture @2\n    liftIO
  $ Text.putStrLn $ \"found \" <> k <> \" set to \" <> v\n\n    case myMap ^. at k
  of\n        Just v' | v /= v' -> do\n            liftIO $ Text.putStrLn $ \"setting
  \" <> k <> \" to \" <> v'\n            _capture @2 .= v'\n        _ -> liftIO $
  Text.putStrLn \"no change\"\n```\n\n## Features\n* Low-surface API covering most
  use cases.\n* Quiet functions with simple types&mdash;for the most part it's  \n`Text`
  _(pattern)_ `-> Text` _(subject)_ `-> result`.\n* Use partial application to create
  performant, compile-once-match-many code.\n* Low cognitive overhead&mdash;there's
  just one custom datatype for both compile\n  and match options, the `Option` monoid.\n*
  `Text` everywhere for interop with both C and the broader Haskell ecosystem.\n*
  Match failures expressed via `Alternative` or pattern match failures.\n* Opt-in
  Template Haskell facilities for compile-time verification of patterns,\n  indexing
  captures, and memoizing inline regexes.\n* Opt-in `lens` support.\n* No failure
  monads to express compile errors, preferring pure functions and\n  throwing imprecise
  exceptions with pretty `Show` instances.  Write simple\n  code and debug it.  Or,
  don't, and use the Template Haskell features instead.\n  Both are first-class.\n*
  Vast presentation of PCRE2 functionality.  We can even register Haskell\n  callbacks
  to run during matching!\n* No dependencies that aren't distributed with GHC.\n*
  Bundled, statically-linked UTF-16 build of ~~up-to-date~~ PCRE2 (version\n  10.35),
  with a complete, exposed Haskell binding.\n\n## TODO\n* Global matching.  (We already
  have global substitution.)\n* Many performance optimizations.  Currently we are
  2&ndash;3&times; slower than\n  other libraries doing most things (order of a few
  &mu;s).\n* Make use of DFA and JIT compilation.\n* Improve PCRE2 C compile time.\n*
  PCRE2 10.36 is out already.\n\n## License\n[Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).
