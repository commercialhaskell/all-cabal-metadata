  # Changelog and Acknowledgements

  ## 2.2.1
  * Fixed [#26](https://github.com/sjshuck/hs-pcre2/issues/26) where wide UTF-8
    characters were not handled correctly.
  * Docs fully updated for UTF-8 instead of UTF-16.  (Docs were deleted from
    the 2.2.0 release.)

  ## 2.2.0
  * Switched to UTF-8 to support `text` 2.0, implementing
    [#22](https://github.com/sjshuck/hs-pcre2/issues/22).  `text` < 2 is no longer
    supported.
    * Changed type synonym `PCRE2_UCHAR` from `CUShort` to `CUChar` in the
      low-level bindings.
    * No API changes in the high-level bindings.
    * There is a minor regression in the ability to match `\R` against line
      separators (U+2028) and paragraph separators (U+2029).  See
      [#26](https://github.com/sjshuck/hs-pcre2/issues/26).

  ## 2.1.1.1
  * Updated library, tests, and docs for `mtl` 2.3 and `microlens-platform`
    0.4.3.0.  The `mtl` part of this is pursuant to
    [#30](https://github.com/sjshuck/hs-pcre2/issues/30).

  ## 2.1.1
  * Added pattern serialization API, which fixes
    [#23](https://github.com/sjshuck/hs-pcre2/issues/23).
  * Updated PCRE2 to 10.40 (no API changes).

  ## 2.1.0.1
  * Explicitly required `text` < 2.
  * Minor docs adjustments.

  ## 2.1.0
  * Replaced `Proxy :: Proxy info` with type applications in splices from
    `regex`/`_regex`.  This significantly shortens the splices, producing nicer
    error messages.  As a very minor consequence, we now require the user to turn
    on `{-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications #-}` when using `regex`/`_regex` with
    patterns with parenthesized captures, even when not using
    `capture`/`_capture`.

  ## 2.0.5
  * Enabled PCRE2's built-in Unicode support, which fixes
    [#21](https://github.com/sjshuck/hs-pcre2/issues/21).

  ## 2.0.4
  * Added `Show` instance for `Captures` to ease debugging user code.

  ## 2.0.3
  * Updated PCRE2 to 10.39 (no API changes).  The C sources are now drawn from
    https://github.com/PhilipHazel/pcre2, which fixes
    [#10](https://github.com/sjshuck/hs-pcre2/issues/10).

  ## 2.0.2
  * Fixed a minor issue where the caret indicating pattern location of a
    `Pcre2CompileException` was misplaced if the pattern contained a newline.

  ## 2.0.1
  * Added `microlens` as a dependency to improve Haddock docs (`Traversal'` _et
    al._ are clickable) and relieve maintenance burden somewhat.
  * Moderate refactoring of internals.

  ## 2.0.0
  This release introduces significant breaking changes in order to make the API
  smaller, more consistent, and safer.
  * Implemented [#18](https://github.com/sjshuck/hs-pcre2/issues/18):
      * Removed `matchAll`, `matchAllOpt`, `capturesAll`, and `capturesAllOpt`.
      * Upgraded `match`, `matchOpt`, `captures`, and `capturesOpt` to offer their
        functionality, respectively.
      * Renamed `capturesA` and `capturesAOpt` to `captures` and `capturesOpt`,
        replacing the latter two functions altogether.  `captures`/-`Opt` were
        intended to be extreme
        [convenience functions](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pcre2-1.1.5/docs/Text-Regex-Pcre2.html#v:captures)
        that required no special datatypes beyond the `Prelude`.  However, this
        was of doubtful benefit, since that's false anyway&mdash;they required
        `Text`, not to mention `{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}`.  Their names
        are simple and valuable, and no other `Alternative`-producing function has
        the naming convention "-`A`", so repurposing their names was in order.
  * Moved the callout interface to a new module, `Text.Regex.Pcre2.Unsafe`.  This
    includes the options `UnsafeCompileRecGuard`, `UnsafeCallout`,
    `UnsafeSubCallout`, and `AutoCallout`, and the types `CalloutInfo`,
    `CalloutIndex`, `CalloutResult`, `SubCalloutInfo`, and `SubCalloutResult`.
  * Also moved option `BadEscapeIsLiteral` there.
  * Removed the ineffectual options `DupNames` and `Utf`.

  Other improvements with no API impact:
  * Updated PCRE2 to 10.37.
  * Replaced copied C files with symlinks, diminishing codebase by 1.5K lines and
    simplifying future PCRE2 updates.
  * Reduced size of Template Haskell splices to make error messages less
    obnoxious.
  * Moderate refactoring of internals and documentation.

  ## 1.1.5
  * Fixed [#17](https://github.com/sjshuck/hs-pcre2/issues/17), where functions
    returning `Alternative` containers were not restricted to single results
    despite their documentation.
  * Minor improvements to docs and examples.

  ## 1.1.4
  * Fixed some incorrect foreign imports' safety.

  ## 1.1.3.1
  * Fixed a very minor issue where `pcreVersion` still reported "10.35" even
    though it in fact was using 10.36.

  ## 1.1.3
  * Made in-house streaming abstraction based on `streaming` and removed the
    latter as a dependency.
  * Updated PCRE2 to 10.36 (no API changes).
  * Docs fixes.

  ## 1.1.2
  * Refactored using the `streaming` library.  Fixed
    [#11](https://github.com/sjshuck/hs-pcre2/issues/11), where large global
    matches were very slow.

  ## 1.1.1
  * Fixed [#12](https://github.com/sjshuck/hs-pcre2/issues/12), where some
    functions returned too many match results.

  ## 1.1.0
  * Added global matching.
      * New functions `matchAll`, `matchAllOpt`, `capturesAll`, `capturesAllOpt`.
      * Changed all traversals from affine to non-affine.
  * Changed `capturesOptA` to `capturesAOpt` for naming consistency.

  ## 1.0.2
  * Fixed [#4](https://github.com/sjshuck/hs-pcre2/4), where multiple named
    captures were not type-indexed correctly.
  * Established automated builds using Github Workflows.  Thanks amesgen!

  ## 1.0.1.1
  * Temporarily eliminate all dependency version bounds to get it building on
    Hackage.

  ## 1.0.1
  * Fixed [#1](https://github.com/sjshuck/hs-pcre2/issues/1), where building on
    Windows would succeed but not run.  Thanks Andrew!
  * Try to adjust dependency version bounds to get it building on Hackage.  Thanks
    snoyberg!

  ## 1.0.0
  * Initial release.

description: "# pcre2\n\n![CI](https://github.com/sjshuck/hs-pcre2/workflows/CI/badge.svg)\n[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/pcre2)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pcre2)\n\nRegular
  expressions for Haskell.  \n\n## Teasers\n```haskell\nlicensePlate :: Text -> Maybe
  Text\nlicensePlate = match \"[A-Z]{3}[0-9]{3,4}\"\n\nlicensePlates :: Text -> [Text]\nlicensePlates
  = match \"[A-Z]{3}[0-9]{3,4}\"\n```\n```haskell\ncase \"The quick brown fox\" of\n
  \   [regex|\\bbrown\\s+(?<animal>[A-z]+)\\b|] -> Text.putStrLn animal\n    _                                      ->
  error \"nothing brown\"\n```\n```haskell\nlet kv'd = lined . packed . [_regex|(?x)
  \ # Extended PCRE2 syntax\n        ^\\s*          # Ignore leading whitespace\n
  \       ([^=:\\s].*?)  # Capture the non-empty key\n        \\s*           # Ignore
  trailing whitespace\n        [=:]          # Separator\n        \\s*           #
  Ignore leading whitespace\n        (.*?)         # Capture the possibly-empty value\n
  \       \\s*$          # Ignore trailing whitespace\n    |]\n\nforMOf kv'd file
  $ execStateT $ do\n    k <- gets $ capture @1\n    v <- gets $ capture @2\n    liftIO
  $ Text.putStrLn $ \"found \" <> k <> \" set to \" <> v\n\n    case myMap ^. at k
  of\n        Just v' | v /= v' -> do\n            liftIO $ Text.putStrLn $ \"setting
  \" <> k <> \" to \" <> v'\n            _capture @2 .= v'\n        _ -> liftIO $
  Text.putStrLn \"no change\"\n```\n\n## Features\n* No opaque \"`Regex`\" object.
  \ Instead, quiet functions with simple\n  types&mdash;for the most part it's `Text`
  _(pattern)_ `-> Text` _(subject)_\n  `-> result`.  Use partial application to create
  performant,\n  compile-once-match-many code.\n* No [custom typeclasses](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/regex-base/docs/Text-Regex-Base-RegexLike.html#t:RegexContext).\n*
  A single datatype for both compile and match options, the `Option` monoid.\n* `Text`
  everywhere.  See [below](#unicode) for a version guide.\n* Match success expressed
  via `Alternative`.\n* Opt-in Template Haskell facilities for compile-time verification
  of patterns,\n  indexing captures, and memoizing inline regexes.\n* Opt-in `lens`
  support.\n* No failure monads to express compile errors, preferring pure functions
  and\n  throwing imprecise exceptions with pretty `Show` instances.  Write simple\n
  \ code and debug it.  Or, don't, and use the Template Haskell features instead.\n
  \ Both are first-class.\n* Vast presentation of PCRE2 functionality.  We can even
  register Haskell\n  callbacks to run during matching!\n* Zero-copying of substrings
  where beneficial.\n* Few dependencies.\n* Bundled, statically-linked UTF-8 (formerly
  UTF-16) build of up-to-date PCRE2\n  (version 10.40), with a complete, exposed Haskell
  binding.\n\n## Performance\nCurrently we are slower than other libraries.  For example:\n\n|
  Operation                 | `pcre2`   | `pcre-light` | `regex-pcre-builtin` |\n|
  :--                       |       --: |          --: |                  --: |\n|
  Compile and match a regex | 3.9 &mu;s |    1.2 &mu;s |            2.9 &mu;s |\n\nIf
  it's really regex processing that's causing a bottleneck,\n[pcre-light](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pcre-light)/[-heavy](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pcre-heavy)/[lens-regex-pcre](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-regex-pcre)\nare
  recommended instead of this library for the very best performance.\n\n## Unicode\n|
  Encoding | `text` version | `pcre2` version | Code unit representation  |\n| :--
  \     | :--            | :--             | :--                       |\n| UTF-8
  \   | &ge; 2         | &ge; 2.2        | `Foreign.C.Types.CUChar`  |\n| UTF-16   |
  &lt; 2         | &lt; 2.2        | `Foreign.C.Types.CUShort` |\n\n## Wishlist\n*
  Many performance optimizations.  Currently we are slower than other libraries.\n
  \ For example:\n* Make use of DFA matching and JIT compilation.\n* Improve PCRE2
  C compile time.\n* Add splitting support.\n\n## License\n[Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).
