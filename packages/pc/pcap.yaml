  # A Haskell wrapper around the C libpcap library.

  It provides Haskell bindings for most of the libpcap API as of libpcap
  version 0.9.7.  The bindings are divided into a very efficient
  low-level wrapper, Network.Pcap.Base, and a higher-level module,
  Network.Pcap, that's easier to use.

  To install:

      cabal install pcap
