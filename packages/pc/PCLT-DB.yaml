description: |-
  \"PCLT\" is an abbreviation for \"Parametric Composable Localizable
  Templates\" - in fact it should also hold Detalizable.
  Term \"Detailizable content (message)\" in this package
  has a following meaning: some content, representing which
  it is possible to regulate, in how much details it is represented.

  Conceptually, this package is a powerful extension to the well known
  Show class, that (extension) is thought to be embeded in any
  Haskell program, which requires multilanguage support, and/or where
  messages should be detailizable.

  For more information about PCLT, read in it's description in it's own
  Cabal file.

  _________

  By the base package (PCLT <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/PCLT>)
  the templates are provided to be stored
  statically in module declarations using
  'Text.PCLT.HasStaticRawPCLTs.HasStaticRawPCLTs' class instaniations.

  The PCST-DB package adds a possibility to store templates in DB
  (under PostgreSQL v8.4. (not less)). ER diagram:
  <http://i1.fastpic.ru/big/2009/1212/f0/5b9845716e5a6984e9bc9d62a61928f0.png>

  The following units are storable in DB:

  * localizable templates

  * localized templates

  * languages

  * collections of localizable templates

  * collections (of localizable templates) compositions

  * catalogs

  * configurations of PCLT catalogs

  * localizable templates detalization policies

  For each catalog in DB there is stored a special flag \"catalog data
  or config changed\". The flag gets raised by an army of triggers,
  that watches every table, and is thought to get dropped by a program,
  which uses DB catalog. Drop the flag right before catalog update
  from DB.

  Unfortunately, the current implementation of this flagging system
  constraints the number of agents that update their catalogs from DB
  by only one (because, when agent updates it's catalog, it drops
  the flag, and other agents don't know that flag was risen, so they
  can't know if version of catalog in their operative memory is older
  then in DB or not).

  But this limitation removal is planned as a first ToDo in the next
  version of PCLT-DB.
