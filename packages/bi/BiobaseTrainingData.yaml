  Parameter training for RNA secondary structure prediction tools
  requires data to train on. Since there are a number of
  different available formats, and handling them all in the
  training tools is a pain, we have this library and programs.
  "MkTrainingData" transforms different formats and they all
  produce a common "training data" format. This format is
  Haskell-readable (and only partially human-readable)
  line-by-line. Generating additional training data is therefor
  easy as one can just "cat" together different training files.

  Note that several features are designed around /extended/ RNA
  secondary structures.

  Now with some filtering and manipulation options.
