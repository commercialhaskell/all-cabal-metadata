description: "\nUsing Haddock markup with Literate Haskell commenting style doesn't
  \ncurrently work.  For instance, to get Haddock markup in an lhs file:\n\ncomments\ncomments\n\n>
  code\n\ncomments\n\nyou'd need to write:\n\n> -- | comments\n> -- comments\n\n>
  code\n\n> -- | comments\n\nThis clearly defeats the purpose of Literate Haskell.
  \ BirdPP is\na preprocessor that works with GHC so you can write what you want:\n\n\n|
  comments\ncomments\n\n> code\n\n| comments\n\nCompilation of this package will give
  you an executable called\nbunlit.  This can be used by ghc using the option -pgmL
  BirdPP.\nE.g.\n\nghc -pgmL BirdPP --make Main.lhs\n"
