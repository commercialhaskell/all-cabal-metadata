  biolib - a Haskell library for bioinformatics

  This is a collection of data structures and algorithms
  I've found useful when building various bioinformatics-related tools
  and utilities.

  Current list of features includes: a Sequence data type supporting
  protein and nucleotide sequences and conversion between them, quality
  data, reading and writing FASTA formatted files, reading TwoBit and
  phd formats, and also FastQ.  Rudimentary support for doing alignments
  - including dynamic adjustment of scores based on sequence quality -
  and Blast output parsing.  Partly implemented single linkage
  clustering, and multiple alignment.  Reading and writing 454-style SFF
  sequences, with a bunch of useful (and not-so-useful) operations on
  them.

  To install, you need to acquire a working GHC (possibly other Haskell
  system).  You also need the following external libraries:

    QuickCheck   - for unit tests ('make test' to run them)
    binary       - mainly for dealing with the TwoBit sequence format
    tagsoup      - for parsing XML output from Blast
    parsec       - for parsing ACE, Bowtie and Soap output

  You should be able to get what you need from <http://hackage.haskell.org/>.

  The easiest way these days, is to use 'cabal'.  You can get away with

    cabal install bio

  As an alternative, you can build with 'make', doing either 'make
  install' if you can sudo, or 'make user_install' if you can not.  Of
  course, the Makefile just proxies for the regular Cabal routine, which
  will work just as well:

    runhaskell Setup configure
    runhaskell Setup build
    sudo runhaskell Setup install

  (Use --prefix=$HOME and remove the sudo, if you don't want to install as root.)

  If that didn't work, mail me at <ketil@malde.org>, and we'll try to
  work things out.
