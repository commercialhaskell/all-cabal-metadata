synopsis: A Haskell library for working with the BitX bitcoin exchange.
changelog: ! 'v0.11.0.1

  * Added new fee_info endpoint.


  v0.11.0.0

  * The BitX API no longer gives trades when returning private orders. BREAKING CHANGE.

  * Due to the above change, a new function -- getAllTrades -- has been added to the
  private order API.

  * The basic types now come with a large set of default typeclasses, to minimise
  the need for orphan instances.


  v0.10.0.0

  * New optional beneficiary ID field for withdrawal requests. BREAKING CHANGE.


  v0.9.0.1

  * Compatibility with http-client-0.5.0 and http-client-tls-0.3.0.

  * The BitXAuth type can now be written as a string using the OverloadedStrings extension.


  v0.9.0.0

  * Use (strict) Text consistantly instead of random string-like types. BREAKING CHANGE.


  v0.8.0.0

  * Added Singapore Dollar.

  * The UnparseableResponse now provides the Aeson error. BREAKING CHANGE.

  * Last_trade and Bid and Ask prices don''t always appear in the Ticker type. BREAKING
  CHANGE.

  * GHC 8.0 is now officially supported.


  v0.7.0.2

  * Forgot to export "status" lens,


  v0.7.0.1

  * Added new "completed_timestamp" field to private order types.


  v0.7.0.0

  * Added new "since" option to public trades'' endpoint. BREAKING CHANGE.

  * Added is_buy field for trade record.

  * Added Indonesian Rupiah.


  v0.6.0.0

  * Added the new endpoint for creating market (spot) orders.

  * Replaced http-conduit with http-client and http-client-tls.

  * Fixed broken rate limiting.


  v0.5.0.1

  * A few more major bugfixes w.r.t. to BitX number formatting.

  * Fixed issue due to BitX''s handling of ints as decimal.


  v0.5.0.0

  * Prices should be integers, not real. BREAKING CHANGE.

  * Dropped support for versions of GHC lower than 7.8.1.


  v0.4.0.1

  * BitX expects decimals to have 6 places and no trailing zeros.

  * Changed license to BSD3.

  * Now builds on Stack LTS-3.


  v0.4.0.0

  * ExceptionResponse now holds the actual exception, rather than its text representation.
  BREAKING CHANGE.


  v0.3.0.0

  * Replaced Volkov records with (micro)lenses. BREAKING CHANGE.

  * Implemented a (naive) mechanism to work around nginx rate limiting.


  v0.2.0.2

  * Added Nigerian Naira.


  v0.2.0.1

  * Record library dependency needs upper bound.


  v0.2.0.0

  * Replaced Decimal with Scientific. BREAKING CHANGE.

  * Divided much of the Private module into smaller sub-modules. BREAKING CHANGE.

  * Added the new endpoint for creating accounts.

  * Remove ill-thought-out Auth module.

  * Lots of internal improvements.

description: ! "[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tebello-thejane/bitx.hs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tebello-thejane/bitx.hs)\n[![Hackage](https://budueba.com/hackage/bitx-bitcoin)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bitx-bitcoin)\n[![BSD3](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSD3-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)\n\n(Hopefully
  useful) Haskell bindings to the [BitX](https://bitx.co/) bitcoin exchange's [API](https://bitx.co/api).\n\nAs
  a minimal example, to get the current selling price (in South African Rand) of bitcoin
  on the\nBitX exchange, do the following:\n\n```haskell\nimport Control.Lens ((^.))\nimport
  Network.Bitcoin.BitX (BitXAPIResponse(..), getTicker, CcyPair(..))\nimport qualified
  Network.Bitcoin.BitX as BitX\nimport Data.Text (unpack)\nimport Network.HTTP.Types.Status
  (Status(..))\nimport Network.HTTP.Client (responseStatus)\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain
  = do\n  bitXResponse <- getTicker XBTZAR\n  case bitXResponse of\n    ValidResponse
  tic        ->\n      case tic ^. BitX.ask of\n        Nothing              ->  putStrLn
  \"The BTC-ZAR exchange not currently have an ask price...\"\n        Just p               ->
  \ putStrLn (\"1 bitcoin will set you back ZAR\" ++ show p ++ \".00.\")\n    ErrorResponse
  err        ->\n        error $ \"BitX error received: \\\"\" ++ unpack (err ^. BitX.error)
  ++ \"\\\"\"\n    ExceptionResponse ex     ->\n        error $ \"Exception was thrown:
  \\\"\" ++ show ex ++ \"\\\"\"\n    UnparseableResponse _ resp ->\n        error
  $ \"Bad HTTP response; HTTP status code was: \\\"\" ++ (show . statusCode . responseStatus
  $ resp) ++ \"\\\"\"\n```\n\nNote that the code snippet above depends on [http-types](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-types),\n[text](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text),
  [http-client](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-client),\n[lens](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens)
  (or any *``lens``-compatible* package, such as\n[microlens](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens)),
  and finally **bitx-bitcoin**.\n\nThis library is known to work on Windows, but if
  you wish to use it then you will have to do a bit\nmore work due to the ``Network``
  library not building on Windows out of the box. See\n[this blog post by Neil Mitchell](http://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2010/12/installing-haskell-network-library-on.html).\n"
