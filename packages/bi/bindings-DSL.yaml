description: ! 'This is a set of macros to be used when writing Haskell FFI.

  They were designed to be able to fully describe C interfaces,

  so that hsc2hs can extract from them all Haskell code needed to

  mimic such interfaces. All Haskell names used are automatically

  derived from C names, structures are mapped to Haskell instances

  of Storable, and there are also macros you can use with C code

  to help write bindings to inline functions or macro functions.

  Documentation is available at package homepage:


  <https://github.com/jwiegley/bindings-dsl/wiki>


  The extra module Bindings.Utilities will contain tools that may

  be convenient when working with FFI.'
