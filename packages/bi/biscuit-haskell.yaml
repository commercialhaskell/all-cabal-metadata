  Main library for biscuit tokens support, providing minting and signature verification of biscuit tokens, as well as a datalog engine allowing to compute the validity of a token in a given context.

  ## Supported biscuit versions

  The core library supports [`v2` biscuits][v2spec] (both open and sealed).

  ## How to use this library

  This library was designed with the use of [`QuasiQuotes`][quasiquotes] in mind.

  A [minimal example][biscuitexample] is provided in the library itself, and the [package documentation][packagedoc] contains comprehensive examples and explanations for all the library features.

  Familiarity with biscuit tokens will make the examples easier to follow.
  Reading the [biscuit presentation][biscuit] and the [biscuit tutorial][biscuittutorial] is advised.

  ### Checking a biscuit token

  To make sure a biscuit token is valid, two checks have to take place:

  - a signature check with a public key, making sure the token is authentic
  - a datalog check making sure the token is authorized for the given context

  ```haskell
  -- public keys are typically serialized as hex-encoded strings.
  -- In most cases they will be read from a config file or an environment
  -- variable
  publicKey' :: PublicKey
  publicKey' = case parsePublicKeyHex "todo" of
    Nothing -> error "Error parsing public key"
    Just k  -> k

  -- this function takes a base64-encoded biscuit in a bytestring, parses it,
  -- checks it signature and its validity. Here the provided context is just
  -- the current time (useful for TTL checks). In most cases, the provided context
  -- will carry a permissions check for the endpoint being accessed.
  verification :: ByteString -> IO Bool
  verification serialized = do
    now <- getCurrentTime
    -- biscuits are typically serialized as base64 bytestrings. The publicKey is needed
    -- to check the biscuit integrity before completely deserializing it
    biscuit <- either (fail . show) pure $ parseB64 publicKey' serialized
    -- the verifier can carry facts (like here), but also checks or policies.
    -- verifiers are defined inline, directly in datalog, through the `verifier`
    -- quasiquoter. datalog parsing and validation happens at compile time, but
    -- can still reference haskell variables.
    let authorizer' = [authorizer|time({now});
                                  allow if true;
                                 |]
    -- `authorizeBiscuit` only works on valid biscuits, and runs the datalog verifications
    -- ensuring the biscuit is authorized in a given context
    result <- authorizeBiscuit biscuit authorizer'
    case result of
      Left e  -> print e $> False
      Right _ -> pure True
  ```

  ### Creating (and attenuating) biscuit tokens

  Biscuit tokens are created from a secret key, and can be attenuated without it.

  ```haskell
  -- secret keys are typically serialized as hex-encoded strings.
  -- In most cases they will be read from a config file or an environment
  -- variable (env vars or another secret management system are favored,
  -- since the secret key is sensitive information).
  -- A random secret key can be generated with `generateSecretKey`
  secretKey' :: SecretKey
  secretKey' = case parseSecretPrivateKeyHex "todo" of
    Nothing -> error "Error parsing secret key"
    Just k  -> k

  creation :: IO ByteString
  creation = do
    -- biscuit tokens carry an authority block, which contents are guaranteed by the
    -- secret key.
    -- Blocks are defined inline, directly in datalog, through the `block`
    -- quasiquoter. datalog parsing and validation happens at compile time, but
    -- can still reference haskell variables.
    let authority = [block|
         // toto
         resource("file1");
         |]
    biscuit <- mkBiscuit secretKey authority
    -- biscuits can be attenuated with blocks. blocks are not guaranteed by the secret key and
    -- should only restrict the token use. This property is guaranteed by the datalog evaluation:
    -- facts and rules declared in a block cannot interact with previous blocks.
    -- Here, the block only adds a TTL check.
    let block1 = [block|check if time($time), $time < 2021-05-08T00:00:00Z;|]
    -- `addBlock` only takes a block and a biscuit, the secret key is not needed:
    -- any biscuit can be attenuated by its holder.
    newBiscuit <- addBlock block1 biscuit
    pure $ serializeB64 newBiscuit
  ```
