  bitset Changelog
  ================

  Here you can see the full list of changes between each bitset release.

  Version 1.4.8

  - Add support for GHC 7.8
  - IsList instance for BitSet, so it's possible to use OverloadedLists extension.

  Version 1.4.7
  -------------

  Released on August 25th, 2013

  - 'GBitSet' was renamed to 'BitSet' and is now 'newtype' as suggested
    by John Ericson, see #10 on GitHub for details.

  Version 1.4.6
  -------------

  Released on July 17th, 2013

  - Fixed build issues on Windows, see #9 on GitHub for details.

  Version 1.4.5
  -------------

  Released on June 6th, 2013

  - Fixed 'Ord' instance, same bug as in 'Eq'. Where is my mind?

  Version 1.4.4
  -------------

  Released on May 14th, 2013

  - Fixed 'Eq' instance, equal sizes don't mean a thing!

  Version 1.4.3
  -------------

  Released on May 13th, 2013

  - Fixed bug with broken cabal distribution.

  Version 1.4.2
  -------------

  - Switched to GMP bit fiddling functions, the corresponding patch for
    'integer-gmp' was submitted to GHC, see
    http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/7860

  Version 1.4.1
  -------------

  Released on April 24th, 2013

  - Removed 'clearBitInteger' which didn't update the size field of
    the newly created 'Integer'. Turns out it's completely non-trivial
    to implement.


  Version 1.4.0
  -------------

  Released on April 4th, 2013

  - More speed optimizations, 'Data.BitSet.Dynamic' is close to 'Data.Set'
    performance on most operations.
  - Added 'Data.BitSet.Word', a bit set with native integer as container
    type, significantly faster then 'Data.Set' for enumerated types with
    small number of constructors.
  - Added folds, 'map' and 'filter' for consistency with other Haskell
    containers.

  Version 1.3.0
  -------------

  Released on March 25th, 2013

  - Added a generic bit set data type, abstract with respect to the underlying
    container.
  - Improved dynamic bit set performance via optimized 'popCount' and
    'testBit' functions.

  Version 1.2
  -----------

  Initial release, released on March 22th, 2013
