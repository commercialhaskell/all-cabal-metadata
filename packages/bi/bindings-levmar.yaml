description: ! 'Low level Haskell bindings to the [C levmar (Levenberg-Marquardt)

  library](http://www.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/levmar/)


  See the [levmar](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/levmar) package

  for a high-level wrapper around this package.


  The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is an iterative technique that finds

  a local minimum of a function that is expressed as the sum of squares

  of nonlinear functions. It has become a standard technique for

  nonlinear least-squares problems and can be thought of as a

  combination of steepest descent and the Gauss-Newton method. When the

  current solution is far from the correct one, the algorithm behaves

  like a steepest descent method: slow, but guaranteed to converge. When

  the current solution is close to the correct solution, it becomes a

  Gauss-Newton method.


  Both unconstrained and constrained (under linear equations and box

  constraints) Levenberg-Marquardt variants are included.  All functions

  have `Double` and `Float` variants.


  Note that the included C library is lightly patched to make it

  pure. This way the functions can be used inside `unsafePerformIO`.
