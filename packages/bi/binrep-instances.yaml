  # binrep-instances
  Orphan instances for binrep.

  binrep mostly cares about standalone data types that are exclusively used with
  its type classes. However, my strongweak library lends itself to working
  together with binrep. But it requires a couple of orphan instances, and adds
  some non-orphan but out-of-place instances to binrep (`WeakenN` is an "ignore"
  layer, which otherwise doesn't fit in binrep). It's kind of like an extension.

  Such orphan instances are pulled out into this library.
