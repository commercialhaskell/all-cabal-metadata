  # binrep
  binrep is a Haskell library for *precisely modelling binary schemas*, especially
  byte-oriented file formats, and working with them effectively and efficiently.
  Here's why it's useful:

    * **Explicit:** Define Haskell data types with the binary schema "baked in".
      Use highly parameterized binary representation primitives including
      null-terminated data (e.g. C-style strings), Pascal-style data (length
      prefixed), sized explicit-endian machine integers, null-padded data. Write
      your own as needed.
    * **Low boilerplate:** Straightforward schemas can leverage efficient generic
      parsers and serializers with just a few lines. (See [Generic binary
      representation](#generic-binary-representation) for details.)
    * **Easy validation:** Use the [strongweak][gh-strongweak] library design
      pattern to define an unvalidated data type for easy internal transformation,
      and get validation code for free.
    * **Performant:** Parsing and serialization is *extremely fast*, using
      [flatparse][gh-flatparse] and [mason][gh-mason] respectively. An
      experimental non-allocating serializer is also provided.

  ## Usage
  ### Dependencies
  You need the **ICU library**. For running, you just need the runtime. For
  building, you need development files as well (headers etc). Alternatively, you
  may turn off the ICU features with a Cabal flag.

  ## Philosophy
  ### Modelling, not serializing
  binrep is good at modelling binary data formats. It is not a plain
  "serialization" library, where the actual binary representation is hidden from
  the user (intentionally, with good reason). The binary and cereal libraries are
  great choices for that. They are interested in defining efficient binary codecs
  for Haskell data. However, their codec typeclasses *hide representation
  decisions* from the user. In cereal,

    * machine integers are encoded with
      [big endian](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cereal-0.5.8.2/docs/src/Data.Serialize.html#line-182)
    * bytestrings are written with an
      [8-byte length prefix](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cereal-0.5.8.2/docs/src/Data.Serialize.html#line-498)

  These are fine decisions. But they aren't accurate to the types. Endianness is
  an implementation decision.

  binrep refuses to work with a machine integer unless it knows the endianness.
  Bytestrings are split into C-style (null-terminated) and Pascal-style
  (length-prefixed). This enforces careful consideration for the binary data being
  modelled.

  ### Validation without boilerplate
  A C-style bytestring must not contain any `0x00` null bytes. A Pascal-style
  bytestring must be short enough to be able to encode its length in the length
  prefix machine integer. But checking such invariants is tedious work. Am I
  really going to wrap everything in a bunch of newtypes and force users to call a
  bunch of checker functions every time?

  Yes and no. Yes, binrep uses newtypes extensively, though most are type synonyms
  over the `Refined` newtype from Nikita Volkov's wonderful [refined][gh-refined]
  library. No, binrep doesn't want you to wrangle with these day-to-day. One
  solution is to define a simplified "weak" type, and convert between it and the
  binary-safe "strong" type. My [strongweak][gh-strongweak] library provides
  supporting definitions for this pattern, and generic derivers which will work
  with binrep's binary representation primitives.

  ### Performant primitives
  Parsing uses András Kovács' [flatparse][gh-flatparse] library. Serializing is
  via Fumiaki Kinoshita's [mason][gh-mason] library. These are about as fast as
  you can get in 2022.

  We only define serializers for validated types, meaning we can potentially skip
  safety checks, that other serializers would do. Except we still do them, but
  validation is an explicitly required step before serialization.

  *This might change if we start to support weirder binary representations,
  specifically offset-based data.*

  ## Generic binary representation
  binrep's generic deriving makes very few decisions:

    * Constructors are encoded by sequentially encoding every enclosed field.
      * Empty constructors thus serialize to 0 bytes.
    * Sum types are encoded via a tag obtained from the constructor names.
      * It's the same approach as aeson, with a bit more flexibility: see below.

  Sum types (data types with multiple constructors) are handled by first encoding
  a "tag field", the value of which then indicates which constructor to use. You
  must provide a function to convert from a constructor name to a (unique) tag.
  You could encode them as a null-terminated ASCII bytestring (this is the
  default), or as a single byte. To ease this, you may consider putting the tag
  value in constructor names:

  ```haskell
  data BinarySumType = B1 | B2

  getConstructorTag :: String -> Word8
  getConstructorTag = read . drop 1

  -- >>> getConstructorTag "B1"
  -- 1

  -- Or use our generic helper, which takes hex values:
  --
  -- >>> cSumTagHex @Word8 (drop . 1) "BFF"
  -- 255
  ```

  ## Similar projects
  ### Kaitai Struct
  [Kaitai Struct](https://kaitai.io/) is a wonderful declarative parser generator
  project. They bolt an expression language and a whole lot of binary cleverness
  on top of a nice YAML schema. It comes with an IDE, a visualizer, and you can
  compile schemas down to parsers for various different languages (no Haskell...).

  Design principles like their fancy absolute offset handling and language
  neutrality have stunted serialization support. Though it's more like they have
  such powerful parsing that they can parse formats that can't be edited and
  re-serialized naively, like archives with file indexes. For proper handling, one
  should store a file table, and serialization generates the index. So in reverse,
  you would want to combine them. But it's a bit program-y. In binrep, you are in
  a programming language, so it's less of a problem... but I'm not sure if we can
  be very efficient at absolute offset stuff.

  Realistically, Kaitai Struct is the best decision for fast iteration on
  reversing unknown data. binrep is useful for loading data straight into Haskell
  for further processing, especially converting between simpler formats.

  ### Wuffs
  [Wuffs](https://github.com/google/wuffs) is a crazy exploration into safe
  low-level code via strong typing. You have to annotate every possibly dangerous
  statement with a proof of safety. It's a tedious, explicit, very safe and very
  fast imperative language for defining parsers and serializers.

  Wuffs is more a codec engineer's tool than a reverse engineer's one. binrep
  isn't really interested in speed, and being a Haskell library we get to focus on
  defining types and their composition in a declarative & functional manner. As
  such, we get to define more useful things quicker using binrep. Though we share
  many core ideas, such as refinement types.

  Check out Wuffs if you need to write a bunch of codecs and they really, really
  need to be both fast and safe. The trade-off is, of course, your time.

  Cool, bit-oriented rather than byte-oriented.
