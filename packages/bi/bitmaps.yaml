  -----

  0.2.6.3
  -----
  * Fixed build errors.
    * Hide imports of `get` from `Control.Monad.Record`.
    * Support ``bitmap-0.0.2``s new major API changes that don't conform to the
      cabal's package versioning policy.
    * Replaced imports of `Foreign` with `System.IO.Unsafe` for `unsafePerformIO`.
      `Foreign` no longer provides `unsafePerformIO`.
    * Replaced calls to `lens` with calls to `lensGS`, since fc-labels recently
      changed lens to take a getter and a modifier rather than a getter and a
      setter.  Eventually this library will be ported from `fc-labels` to `lens`,
      which was written after this project was first developed.
  * Fixed warnings.
    * Removed redundant import of `Control.Bitmap.Searchable` from
      `Data.Bitmap.String.Internal`.

  0.2.6.2
  -----
  * Add homepage and bug-reports to cabal file, linking to the github repository
    and its issue tracker, respectively.
  * Added `CHANGELOG.md`.
