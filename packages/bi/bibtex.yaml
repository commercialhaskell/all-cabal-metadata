  This package allows parsing, formatting and processing of BibTeX files.
  BibTeX files are databases for literature for the natbib package
  of the LaTeX typesetting system.

  The package contains two examples:

  * The first example demonstrates the BibTeX parser
  by generating a publication overview from a @.bib@ file.

  * The second example demonstrates the BibTeX generation
  by producing a large @.bib@ file from the tar archive
  that cabal-install downloads to your local cabal directory.

  Both examples will be build as stand-alone executable
  when running

  > cabal install -fbuildExamples bibtex

  For the first example see the @publications@ directory of this package.
  You can start the program and build an example document by running

  > make pubs

  Technically the program generates a list of custom @\\nocite@ commands
  for the LaTeX package @multibib@.
  You can add the custom bibtex field @subtype@ to BibTeX entries
  for more detailed categorization of an entry.
  See "publications/publications.bib" for examples.

  The second example can be executed using

  > make hackbib

  The file @hackage.bib@ is written to the @hackage@ subdirectory.
  The @hackage-bibtex@ program
  reads an uncompressed tar archive from standard input
  and writes the result bibliography file to standard output.

  Note that @hackage.bib@ exceeds some limits of standard BibTeX and LaTeX:
  There are currently much more than 5000 versions of packages,
  the maximum my BibTeX can handle at once.
  That is, you can use the bibliography file,
  but you cannot cite all entries with @\\nocite*@.
  If there are more than 26 uploads by the same author in a year,
  the BibTeX style @alpha@ generates identifiers including curly braces
  which interacts badly with LaTeX's handling of them.
  If you reduce the Bibliography file to 5000 entries
  and try to generate an overview of all entries with @\\nocite@,
  then @pdflatex@ hits its limits:
