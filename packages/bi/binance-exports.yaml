  Export Your Binance Trade History to a CSV.

  Sometime during February 2022, Binance removed their `Trade History` page,
  along with the ability to export your completed trades. The `Order History`
  export is still available, but the format is more difficult to parse. This
  command is a replacement for the `Trade History` export, generating CSVs with
  an almost-identical format. There are two differences: we split the trade
  symbol into two separate asset columns & include the trade ID.

  Requires [`stack`][get-stack] & a Binance.us API key & secret:

  ```sh
  stack run -- -k <API_KEY> -s <API_SECRET> <SYMBOL1> <SYMBOL2> etc
  stack run -- --help
  ```

  TODO:

  * Switch between Binance & Binance US APIs
  * Config file & env var overrides for CLI args
  * Release v1, add package to hackage & stackage


  [get-stack]: https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/


  ## Install

  You can install the CLI exe by running `stack install`. This lets you call the
  executable directly instead of through stack:

  ```sh
  $ stack install
  $ export PATH="${HOME}/.local/bin/:${PATH}"
  $ binance-exports -k <API_KEY> -s <API_SECRET> SOLUSD
  time,base-asset,quote-asset,type,price,quantity,total,fee,fee-currency,trade-id
  2022-03-01 21:20:44,SOL,USD,BUY,42.2424,0.42,42.90010000,0.0009001,BNB,9001
  ```


  ## Build

  You can build the project with stack:

  ```sh
  stack build
  ```

  For development, you can enable fast builds with file-watching,
  documentation-building, & test-running:

  ```sh
  stack test --haddock --fast --file-watch --pedantic
  ```

  To build & open the documentation, run:

  ```sh
  stack haddock --open binance-exports
  ```
