description: "This package provides bindings to the \n[H3 C API v4](https://h3geo.org/docs/api/indexing).
  \ \nH3 is a geospatial indexing system that partitions the world \ninto hexagonal
  cells. \n\nFor users with experience with bindings for other languages, \nwe recommend
  reviewing the project README, as we have \nincluded notes for using the methods
  provided in this package. \nIn particular, as we bind to the C methods with few
  adjustments \nto inputs and outputs beyond data marshalling, \nthere will be some
  differences for those familiar with the \npython (and likely other) bindings, e.g.
  the methods \nprovided in this package expect the latitude and longitude \nto be
  in radians rather than degrees. "
