description: |-
  This library provides the ability to coordinate the remote ssh
  execution of commands on target nodes and display the results in a
  console interface.  The console interface can either be a cmdline
  (CLI) or a text interface (TUI), based on brick and vty; support is
  provided for extension to other UI components as well.

  Almost all of the functionality is provided in the library itself;
  it just needs an executable that will invoke it with the set of
  remote nodes.  See the 'GetRemotes.hs' file for an example: remotes
  can be of any type that is an instance of @WorkEntry@ with an
  associated @WorkGroup@ grouping.

  There is an onrmttest executable built that showcases the
  functionality using ssh operations to localhost, and a
  corresponding onrmttestline executable that provides a simple CLI.
