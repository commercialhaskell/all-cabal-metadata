  # one-line-aeson-text

  `one-line-aeson-text` is a very simply pretty-printer for [Aeson] values. It produces single-line output, which you may want for displaying short JSON data in log files. Our function output is similar to normal Aeson rendering, but we include spaces after comma and colon characters to produce text that is slightly more suitable for human consumption.
