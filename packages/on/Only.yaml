description: |-
  This package provides a canonical anonymous 1-tuple type missing
  from Haskell for attaching typeclass instances.

  NOTE: There is also the </package/OneTuple OneTuple package> which
  by using a boxed @data@-type provides a 1-tuple type which has
  laziness properties which are more faithful to the ones of Haskell's
  native tuples; whereas the primary purpose of 'Only' is to
  provide the traditionally so named type-wrapper for attaching typeclass
  instances.
