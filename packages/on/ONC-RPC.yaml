  # Haskell ONC (Sun) RPC and XDR tools and library

  Haskell tools and library for interacting with ONC RPC (aka Sun RPC) protocols.
  The goal is a working NFS4 client, so TCP clients and efficient large data
  handling will be prioritized over servers, UDP, and portmaping.  It includes
  the following complete components.

  ## Primary Components

  ### hsrpcgen

  A code-generator for .x (XDR) files which you can call directly or use as a
  pre-processor from cabal (see [Setup.hs](Setup.hs) for an example).  The module
  [Network.ONCRPC.Prot](Network/ONCRPC/Prot.hs) in this package is itself
  generated from the [XDR description](Network/ONCRPC/Prot.x) of the RPC
  protocol.  While many .x files will work as-is, some depend on C-specific
  functionality that will require some minor tweaking.

  ### Network.ONCRPC.Client

  A client library which allows you to use the generated module to make RPC calls
  to servers.

  ## Example

  ```
  hsrpcgen -P nfs.x -o NFS.hs
  ```

  ```haskell
  import qualified Network.ONCRPC as RPC
  import qualified NFS

  client <- RPC.openClient $ RPC.ClientServerPort "nfs.server.example.com" "nfs"
  reply <- RPC.rpcCall client $ RPC.Call (NFS.nFSPROC_NULL (NFS.nFS_VERSION NFS.nFS_PROGRAM)) RPC.AuthNone RPC.AuthNone ()
  RPC.closeClient client
  ```

  ## References

  This package implements [RFC5531](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5531) and
  [RFC4506](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4506) as closely as possible.

  [xdrgen](http://github.com/jthornber/xdrgen) is a rpcgen replacement for
  other languages, written in Haskell.  By contrast, this project targets full RPC
  support in Haskell.
