  ===================


  This package uses machinery from *[one-liner][]* in order to provide default

  implementations for methods from `Num`, `Fractional`, `Floating`, `Semigroup`,

  and `Monoid`.  These will work for any types (deriving `Generic`) that are

  made with one constructor, whose fields are all instances of that typeclass.


  [one-liner]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/one-liner


  So, `gPlus` (generic addition) will work for:


  ```haskell

  data Tup1 a b = Tup1 a b            -- requires Num a, Num b

  data Tup2 a   = Tup2 Int a          -- requires Num a, Num b

  data Tup3     = Tup3 Int Double

  data Tup4 a b = Tup4 Int Double     -- no constraint on a or b

  ```


  But not on:


  ```haskell

  data Tup5 a   = Tup2 String a       -- String is not an instance of Num

  ```


  These are implemented by applying the operation to every field.


  Newtype wrappers

  ----------------


  Similar to `WrappedMonoid` and `WarppedMonad` from *base*, some convenient

  newtype wrappers are provided that will give free instances of `Num`, etc. for

  appropriate types:


  If `a` is a data type (deriving `Generic`) with a single constructor whose

  fields all have instances of `Num`, then `GNum a` has a `Num` instance (and

  same for `Fractional`, `Floating`, etc.).


  If `a` is a data type (deriving `Generic`) with a single constructor whose

  fields all have instances of `Semigroup`, then `GMonoid a` has a `Semigroup`

  instance (and same for `Monoid`).
