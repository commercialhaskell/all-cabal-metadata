  # 0.2.5

  * Add GHCJS support (statistical analysis is not supported)
  * Fix issue with perRunEnv
  * Drop support for GHC 7.8

  # 0.2.4

  * `Enhancement`: Add `nfAppIO` and `whnfAppIO` functions, which take a function
    and its argument separately like `nf`/`whnf`, but whose function returns `IO`
    like `nfIO`/`whnfIO`. This is useful for benchmarking functions in which the
    bulk of the work is not bound by IO, but by pure computations that might
    otherwise be optimized away if the argument is known statically.

  * `Bug Fix`: Pass `-m exact` option to the child processes used to run
    benchmarks in an isolated manner. This avoids running a wrong benchmark due
    to the default prefix match.

  # 0.2.3

  * Add a new benchmark matching option "-m exact" to match the benchmark name
    exactly.

  # 0.2.2

  * Write data to CSV file in quick mode too.
  * Fix the CSV file header to match with the data rows for the `--csvraw` case.
  * Fix issue with GC metrics in 32 bits that would silently wrap and failure in optional machinery.
  * Simplify dependencies in tests using foudation checks.

  # 0.2.1

  * Inline math-functions & mwc-random:
    * Remove most functions, instances and types, that are unnecessary for gauge
    * Remove unsafe seeding with partial seed (unused in gauge anyway)
    * Remove vector-th-unbox dependency (transitively template-haskell, pretty, ghc-boot-th)
    * Remove time dependency
  * Re-add Gauge.Benchmark to Gauge.Main to keep the transition between criterion and gauge easy
  * Fix cycles reporting on linux, osx and windows
  * Add some extra callstack for reporting on partial function
  * Fix compilation with Semigroup => Monoid (compilation on 8.4). still unsupported
  * Add some color on terminal output

  # 0.2.0

  * `Usability`: Simplify and organize the documentation and user APIs.
  * `Functionality`:
    * Add measurement and reporting of more performance counters on
      Unices (collected via getrusage) for example page faults, user time, system
      time and rss are now available in verbose mode.
    * Re-enable CSV analysis with the same output format as criterion (`--csv`)
    * Add CSV measurement dumping with `--csvraw`
  * `Control`: Provide better control over measurement process with
    `--min-samples`, `--min-duration` and `--include-first-iter` flags.
  * `Speed:` Add `--quick` flag that provides results much faster (10x) without
    using statistical analysis.
  * Reliability:
    * Fix a bug in GC stats collection and reporting with GHC 8.2 that caused
      incorrect reporting of some GC stats.
    * Fix a bug in statistical regression that caused incorrect reporting of mean
      and other stats.
    * Improve reliability by isolating benchmarks from one another using the
      `--measure-with` flag. The results of one benchmark are no longer affected
      by other benchmarks because each benchmark runs in a separate process.
    * Introduce an optional value type `Optional` with an efficient runtime
      representation to replace the ad-hoc fromXXX functions and the untyped
      approach.
  * Modularity:
    * Introduce `--measure-only` flag that allows just measurement and no
      analysis or reporting.
    * Provide modular build, measurement code is cleanly separated from
      statistical analysis code. As a result a leaner version can now be built
      without analysis code (controlled by the `analysis` build flag).
    * Clean, refactor & rewrite source code
  * Remove code-page dependency

  # 0.1.3

  * Simplify monad handling, remove foundation as dependency

  # 0.1.2

  * condensed display with `--small`

  # 0.1.1

  * remove optparse-applicative

  # 0.1.0

  * remove bunch of dependencies
  * initial import of criterion-1.2.2.0

  # Gauge: a clone of criterion

  This is a clone of criterion with a code / dependencies on a diet. It works the same way as criterion
  for outputing to terminal benchmark data.

  ## features compared to criterion

  missing:

  * JSON export
  * HTML/javascript pages
  * Glob benchmark matching

  Added:

  * Small condensed output (`-s` or `--small`)
  * Raw measurements dumping (CSV)

  ## Future Feature Plan

  * Remove further dependencies
  * storing benchmarks data in CSV and JSON
  * Add a standalone program taking benchmark data files and rendering to html/javascript/graphs
  * Make the library more useful as a standalone library to gather benchmark numbers related to functions in a programatic way

  ## Small mode

  It's hard to compare many benchmarks with criterion, so gauge has a `--small` output:

  ```
  identity                                 mean 41.65 ns  ( +- 2.246 ns  )
  slow                                     mean 163.9 ns  ( +- 9.683 ns  )
  ```
