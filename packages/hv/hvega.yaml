synopsis: Create Vega-Lite visualizations (version 3) in Haskell.
changelog: "For the latest version of this document, please see\n[https://github.com/DougBurke/hvega/blob/master/hvega/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/DougBurke/hvega/blob/master/hvega/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n##
  0.4.1.1\n\nAvoid a build warning about importing <> from Data.Monoid in GHC 8.8.1\nby
  using the CPP sledge-hammer. Relaxed the bounds on containers so\nthat the tests
  can be built on stack LTS 9.21 (GHC 8.0.2).\n\n## 0.4.1.0\n\nUpdated the tutorial,
  adding in a new plot to introduce the addition\nof a second axis to the visualization
  (`parallaxBreakdown`).\n\n## 0.4.0.0\n\nThanks to (in no order): Matthew Pickering
  (mpickering),\nAdam Conner-Sax (adamConnerSax), and Jo Wood (jwoLondon).\n\nThis
  is a large release, in that it greatly-improves the functionality\nof hvega (more-closely
  aligning it with version 3.4.0 of the Vega-Lite\nspecification), but does provide
  a number of **breaking changes** (a\nnumber of functions and constructors have either
  been removed or had\nsome combination of being renamed, argument types have changed,
  or the\nnumber of arguments has been changed). The documentation has also\nseen
  a number of additions and improvements.\n\nA large number of functions, data types,
  and constructors for data\ntypes have been added, based on version 1.12.0 (and the
  development\nversion of the next release) of the elm-vegalite module. Thanks to
  Jo\nWood for doing all the work! The Haddock documentation indicates new\nsymbols
  with the `since 0.4.0.0` label.\n\n### Bug fixes\n\nCorrected the serialization
  of the `datasets` function, reported by\nMatthew Pickering as [issue\n29](https://github.com/DougBurke/hvega/issues/17).\n\nImproved
  the output to better-match the Vega Lite 3.4.0 specification.\nNote that hvega does
  not guarantee that it always creates valid output,\nin part because this would complicate
  the API, but also because the\nVega-Lite specification is changing (e.g. I reported
  several issues with\nversion 3.3.0 of the specification during development of this
  release,\nsome of which have been addressed in the 3.4.0 version).\n\n### New functions,
  symbols, and types\n\nThe error-related types and functions discussed below are
  based on\nchanges provided by Adam Conner-Sax.\n\n`toVegaLiteSchema` has been added
  to allow you to specify a different\nVega-Lite schema. `toVegaLite` uses version
  3 but version 4 is being\nworked on as I type this. The `vlSchema` function has
  been added,\nalong with `vlSchema4`, `vlSchema3`, and `vlSchema2` values. The\n`toHtmlWith`
  and `toHtmlFileWith` functions have been added to support\nmore control over the
  embedding of the Vega-Lite visualizations, and\nthe versions of the required Javascript
  libraries used by the\n`toHtmlXXX` routines has been updated.\n\nThe `VLProperty`
  type now exports its constructors, to support users\nwho may need to tweak or augment
  the JSON Vega-Lite specification\ncreated by `hvega` (see [issue\n17](https://github.com/DougBurke/hvega/issues/17)).
  It has also gained\nseveral new constructors and associated functions, which are
  given in\nbrackets after the constructor: `VLAlign` (`align`); `VLBounds`\n(`bounds`);
  `VLCenter` (`center`, `centerRC`); `VLColumns`\n(`columns`); `VLConcat` (`vlConcat`);
  `VLSpacing` (`alignRC`,\n`spacing`, `spacingRC`); `VLUserMetadata` (`usermetadata`);
  and\n`VLViewBackground` (`viewBackground`). It is expected that you will be\nusing
  the functions rather the constructors!\n\nThe `ZIndex` type has been added: this
  provides constructors for the\ncommon options - `ZFront` and `ZBack` - and a fall-through
  (`ZValue`)\nas a protection against future changes to the Vega-Lite specification.\n\nFour
  new type aliases have been added: `Angle`, `Color`, `Opacity`,\nand `ZIndex`. These
  do not provide any new functionality but do\ndocument intent.\n\nThe `noData` function
  has been added to let compositions define the\nsource of the data (whether it is
  from the parent or not), and data\nsources can be named with `dataName`. Data can
  be created with\n`dataSequence`, `dataSequenceAs`, and `sphere`. Graticules can
  be\ncreated with `graticule`.  The `NullValue` type has been added to\n`DataValue`
  to support data sources that are missing elements, but for\nmore-complex cases it
  is suggested that you create your data as an\nAeson Value and then use `dataFromJson`.
  Support for data imputation\n(creating new values based on existing data) has been
  added, as\ndiscussed below.\n\nThe alignment, size, and composition of plots can
  be defined and\nchanged with `align`, `alignRC`, `bounds`, `center`, `centerRC`,\n`columns`,
  `spacing`, and `spacingRC`.\n\nPlots can be combined and arranged with: `facet`,
  `facetFlow`,\n`repeat`, `repeatFlow`, and `vlConcat`\n\nNew functions for use in
  a `transform`: `flatten`, `flattenAs`,\n`fold`, `foldAs`, `impute`, and `stack`.\n\nNew
  functions for use with `encoding`: `fillOpacity`, `strokeOpacity`,\n`strokeWidth`,\n\nThe
  ability to arrange specifications has added the \"flow\" option\n(aka \"repeat\").
  This is seen in the addition of the `Flow` constructor\nto the `Arrangement` type
  - which is used with `ByRepeatOp`,\n`HRepeat`, `MRepeat`, `ORepeat`, `PRepeat`,
  and `TRepeat`.\n\nThe `Mark` type has gained `Boxplot`, `ErrorBar`, `ErrorBand`,
  and\n`Trail` constructors. The `MarkProperty` type has gained `MBorders`,\n`MBox`,
  `MExtent`, `MHeight`, `MHRef`, `MLine`, `MMedian`, `MOrder`,\n`MOutliers`, `MNoOutliers`,
  `MPoint`, `MRule`, `MStrokeCap`, `MStrokeJoin`,\n`MStrokeMiterLimit`, `MTicks`,
  `MTooltip`, `MWidth`, `MX`, `MX2`,\n`MXOffset`, `MX2Offset`, `MY`, `MY2`, `MYOffset`,
  and `MY2Offset`\nconstructors.\n\nThe `Position` type has added `XError`, `XError2`,
  `YError`, and\n`YError2` constructors.\n\nThe `MarkErrorExtent` type was added.\n\nThe
  `BooleanOp` type has gained the `FilterOp` and `FilterOpTrans`\nconstructors which
  lets you use `Filter` expressions as part of a\nboolean operation. The `Filter`
  type has also gained expresiveness,\nwith the `FLessThan`, `FLessThanEq`, `FGreaterThan`,
  `FGreaterThanEq`,\nand `FValid`.\n\nThe `Format` type has gained the `DSV` constructor,
  which allow you\nto specify the separator character for column data.\n\nThe MarkChannel
  type has been expanded to include: `MBinned`, `MSort`,\n`MTitle`, and `MNoTitle`.
  The PositionChannel type has added\n`PHeight`, `PWidth`, `PNumber`, `PBinned`, `PImpute`,
  `PTitle`, and\n`PNoTitle` constructors.\n\nThe LineMarker and PointMarker types
  have been added for use with\n`MLine` and `MPoint` respectively (both from `MarkProperty`).\n\nThe
  ability to define the binning property with \n`binAs`, `DBin`, `FBin`, `HBin`, `MBin`,
  `OBin`, `PBin`, and `TBin` has\nbeen expanded by adding the `AlreadyBinned` and
  `BinAnchor`\nconstructors to `BinProperty`, as well as changing the `Divide`\nconstructor
  (as described below).\n\nThe `StrokeCap` and `StrokeJoin` types has been added.
  These are used\nwith `MStrokeCap`, `VBStrokeCap`, and `ViewStrokeCap` and\n`MStrokeJoin`,
  `VBStrokeJoin`, and `ViewStrokeJoin` respectively.\n\nThe `StackProperty` constructor
  has been added with the `StOffset`\nand `StSort` constructors. As discussed below
  this is a breaking change\nsince the old StackProperty type has been renamed to
  `StackOffset`.\n\nThe `ScaleProperty` type has seen significant enhancement, by
  adding\nthe constructors: `SAlign`, `SBase`, `SBins`, `SConstant` and\n`SExponent`.
  \ THe `Scale` tye has added `ScSymLog` `ScQuantile`,\n`ScQuantize`, and `ScThreshold`.\n\nThe
  `SortProperty` type has new constructors: `CustomSort`,\n`ByRepeatOp`, `ByFieldOp`,
  and `ByChannel`. See the breaking-changes\nsection below for the constructors that
  were removed.\n\nThe `AxisProperty` type has seen significant additions, including:\n`AxBandPosition`,
  `AxDomainColor`, `AxDomainDash`,\n`AxDomainDashOffset`, `AxDomainOpacity`, `AxDomainWidth`,\n`AxFormatAsNum`,
  `AxFormatAsTemporal`, `AxGridColor`, `AxGridDash`,\n`AxGridDashOffset`, `AxGridOpacity`,

  `AxTitleFontSize`, `AxTitleFontStyle`,\n`AxTitleFontWeight`, `AxTitleLimit`, `AxTitleOpacity`,
  `AxTitleX`, and\n`AxTitleY`.\n\nThe `AxisConfig` has seen a similar enhancement,
  and looks similar\nto the above apart from the constructors do not start with 'Ax'.\n\nThe
  `LegendConfig` type has been significantly expanded and, as\ndiscussed in the Breaking
  Changes section, changed. It has gained:\n`LeClipHeight`, `LeColumnPadding`, `LeColumns`,
  `LeGradientDirection`,\n`LeGradientHorizontalMaxLength`, `LeGradientHorizontalMinLength`,\n`LeGradientLength`,

  `SymStroke`, `SymTriangle`,\n`SymTriangleLeft`, `SymTriangleRight`, and `SymWedge`.\n\n###
  Breaking Changes\n\nSome of these are repeated from above.\n\nThe `title` function
  now takes a second argument, a list of `TitleConfig`\nvalues for configuring the
  appearance of the title.\n\nThe `SReverse` construtor was removed from `ScaleProperty`
  as it\nrepresented a Vega, rather than Vega-Lite, property. The `xSort`\nconstructors
  are used to change the order of an item (e.g. `PSort`,\n`MSort`).\n\nThe `ScSequential`
  constructor was removed from `Scale` as\n`ScLinear` should be used.\n\nThe `SortProperty`
  type has had a number of changes: the `Op`,\n`ByField`, and `ByRepeat` constructors
  have been removed, and\n`ByRepeatOp`, `ByFieldOp`, and `ByChannel` constructors
  have been\nadded.\n\nThe `AxTitleMaxLength` and `TitleMaxLength` constructors have
  been\nremoved (from `AxisProperty` and `AxisConfig` respectively) as they\nare invalid.
  The `AxTitleLimit` (new in this release) and\n`TitleLimit` constructors should be
  used instead.\n\n`AxisProperty`: the `AxValues` constructor has been changed from\naccepting
  a list of doubles to `DataValues`. The `AxDates`\nconstructor has been deprecated
  and `AxValues` should be used\ninstead.\n\nThere have been significant changes to
  the `LegendConfig` type: the\n`EntryPadding`, `GradientHeight`, `GradientLabelBaseline`,\n`GradientWIdth`,
  and `SymbolColor` constructors have been removed;\nthe renaming constructors have
  been renamed so they all begin with\n`Le` (e.g. `Orient` is now `LeOrient`, and
  `Orient` has been added\nto `AxisConfig`); and new constructors have been added.\n\nThe
  `StackProperty` type has been renamed to `StackOffset` and its\nconstructors have
  changed, and a new `StackProperty`\ntype has been added (that references the `StackOffset`
  type).\n\nThe `Average` constructor of `Operation` was removed, and `Mean`\nshould
  be used instead.\n\nThe `LEntryPadding` constructor of `LegendProperty` was removed.\n\nThe
  arguments to the `MDataCondition`, `TDataCondition`, and\n`HDataCondition` constructors
  - of `MarkChannel`, `TextChannel`,\nand `HyperlinkChannel` respectively - have changed
  to support\naccepting multiple expressions.\n\nThe `MarkOrientation` type has been
  renamed `Orientation`.\n\nThe constructors of the `ViewConfig` type have been renamed
  so they\nall begin with `View` (to match `ViewWidth` and `ViewHeight`).\n\nThe constructors
  of the `ProjectionProperty` type have been renamed\nso that they begin with `Pr`
  rather than `P` (to avoid conflicts\nwith the `PositionChannel` type).\n\nThe `Divide`
  constructor of `BinProperty` now takes a list of\nDoubles rather than two.\n\nThe
  `TitleConfig` type has gained the following constructors:\n`TFontStyle`, `TFrame`,
  `TStyle`, and `TZIndex`. The `TitleFrame`\ntype was added for use with `TFrame`.\n\nThe
  `ArgMax` and `ArgMin` constructors of `Operation` now take an\noptional field name,
  to allow them to be used as part of an encoding\naggregation (e.g. with `PAggregate`).\n\nThe
  \"z index\" value has changed from an 'Int' to the 'ZIndex' type.\n\nThe constructors
  for the `Symbol` type now all start with `Sym`, so\n`Cross`, `Diamond`, `TriangleUp`,
  `TriangleDown`, and `Path` have been\nrenamed to `SymCross`, `SymDiamond`, `SymTriangleUp`,\n`SymTriangleDown`,
  and `SymPath`, respectively.\n\nThe `Legend` type has been renamed `LegendType`
  and its constructors\nhave been renamed 'GradientLegend' and 'SymbolLegend'.\n\n###
  Improved testing\n\nAdded a test suite based on the Elm Vega-Lite tests (based entirely
  on\nthe work of Jo Wood).\n\nThe IPython notebooks have been expanded to cover recent
  changes in the\n[Vega-Lite gallery](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/),
  and\ninclude validation of the output (to check against the expected output).\n\n##
  0.3.0.1\n\nThe minimum base version has been bumped from 4.7 to 4.9, which\nmeans
  ghc 8.0 or later. This is because the 0.2.0.1 release\ndoes not appear to build
  with ghc 7.10. If this restriction is\na problem then please comment on the issues
  list.\n\nThere have been minor documentation updates, adding `@since`\nannotations.\n\n##
  0.3.0.0\n\nThe `Channel` type has been extended to include `ChFill` and `ChStroke`\nconstructors
  and the `tooltips` function allows you to provide\nmultiple tooltips for a channel.
  The schema version has been changed\nfrom 2 to 3, but there has been limited checking
  to see if the API\ncorrectly reflects the new schema.\n\nThis functionality was
  provided by Adam Massmann (massma) and\nBinderDavid.\n\n## 0.2.1.0\n\nAdded the
  `toHtml` and `toHtmlFile` functions which create the necessary\nHTML to view the
  \ Vega-Lite visualization using\n[Vega Embed](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/usage/embed.html)\n(this
  is similar to how\n[ihaskell-hvega](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ihaskell-hvega)\nworks).\n\nThis
  functionality was provided by Gregory Schwartz; apologies for\ntaking so long to
  get it released.\n\n## 0.2.0.0\n\nThe constructors for the LegendOrientation type
  have been renamed (by\nadding the prefix `LO`) which avoids the name clash with
  `Left` and `Right`\nseen in earlier releases. This is a breaking API change.\n\nClarify
  how to use the library in the main `hvega` module.\n\nThanks to contributions from
  Nicolas Mattia (nmattia) and Marco Zocca (ocramz).\n\n## 0.1.0.3\n\nThe only change
  is to the cabal file, where `cabal-version: >=1.18` has\nbeen changed to `cabal-version:
  1.18`.\n\n## 0.1.0.2\n\nUpdated the upper bounds of `aeson` to really allow v1.4.
  This was not\nreleased on Hackage.\n\n## 0.1.0.1\n\nUpdated the upper bounds of
  `aeson` from v1.2 to v1.4.\n\nThe cabal package now includes `stack.yaml` and `default.nix`
  (although\nthe latter is *not* guaranteed to be correct), as well as a\nchange log
  and an extra image.\n\n## 0.1.0.0\n\nThis is the initial version of `hvega`, which
  is based on\nversion 2.2.1 of the\n[Elm Vega library](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/gicentre/elm-vega/2.2.1/VegaLite).\n"

  # hvega

  Create [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) visualizations in
  Haskell. It targets version 3 of the Vega-Lite specification. Note that
  the module does not include a viewer for these visualizations (which are
  JSON files), but does provide several helper functions, such as
  [toHtmlFile](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hvega/docs/Graphics-Vega-VegaLite.html#v:toHtmlFile),
  which create HTML that can be viewed
  with a browser to display the visualization. Other approaches include
  automatic display in IHaskell notebooks - with the
  [ihaskell-vega](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ihaskell-hvega)
  package - or use of external viewers such as
  [Vega View](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vega-view) and
  [Vega-Desktop](https://github.com/vega/vega-desktop).

  It is based on an early version (2.2.1) of the
  [Elm Vega library](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/gicentre/elm-vega/2.2.1/VegaLite),
  which is released under a BSD3 license by Jo Wood of the giCentre at the
  City University of London.

  This code is released under the BSD3 license.

  ## Example

  ```Haskell
  let cars =  dataFromUrl "https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json" []

      enc = encoding
              . position X [ PName "Horsepower", PmType Quantitative ]
              . position Y [ PName "Miles_per_Gallon", PmType Quantitative ]
              . color [ MName "Origin", MmType Nominal ]

      bkg = background "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05)"

  in toVegaLite [ bkg, cars, mark Circle [], enc [] ]
  ```

  When viewed with a Vega-Lite aware viewer, the resultant plot is

  ![Simple scatterplot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DougBurke/hvega/master/hvega/images/intro.png "Simple scatterplot")

  ## Documentation

  A tutorial is provided as part of the module: it is based, as is
  so much of the module, on the
  [Elm Vega walk through](https://github.com/gicentre/elm-vegalite/tree/master/docs/walkthrough).
  The tutorial
  is [available on hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hvega/docs/Graphics-Vega-Tutorials-VegaLite.html) - and includes the plot outputs -
  and the plots it creates are also available by importing the
  `Graphics.Vega.Tutorials.VegaLite` module.

  The
  [Vega-Lite Example Gallery](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/) has
  been converted to an
  [IHaskell notebook](https://github.com/DougBurke/hvega/blob/master/notebooks/VegaLiteGallery.ipynb)
  Uunfortunately the plots created by VegaEmbed **do not always appear**
  in the notebook when viewed with either GitHub's viewer or
  [ipynb viewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/DougBurke/hvega/blob/master/notebooks/VegaLiteGallery.ipynb),
  but things seem much better when using Jupyter Lab (rather than
  notebook) to create the notebooks (since Vega is natively
  supported in this environment). The notebooks have been re-created
  using Jupyter Lab (thanks to Tweag I/O's
  [JupyterWith environment](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2019-02-28-jupyter-with.html)), which should make the plots appear on GitHub (you may need
  to reload the notebooks as I find they don't display on the
  first try).

  The [notebooks directory](https://github.com/DougBurke/hvega/tree/master/notebooks)
  contains a poorly-curated set of examples and experiments with hvega.

  ## Differences to Elm Vega

  Elm Vega has changed significantly since I started `hvega`, and no-longer
  exposes data types directly but uses functions instead: for example,
  rather than `PName`, it uses a function like `pName`. It is an open
  question whether `hvega` will make the same switch. Over time
  the naming of certain operations or data types has diverged between
  `hevga` and Elm Vega.

  One of the more-obvious changes is that the output of `toVegaLite`
  is a separate type from the input values - that is `VegaLite`
  and `VLSpec` - since it makes it easier to display the output of
  `hvega` in `IHaskell`. The JSON specification is retrieved from
  this type with `fromVL`.
