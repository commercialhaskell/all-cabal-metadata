synopsis: Create Vega-Lite visualizations in Haskell.
changelog: |
  For the latest version of this document, please see
  [https://github.com/DougBurke/hvega/blob/master/hvega/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/DougBurke/hvega/blob/master/hvega/CHANGELOG.md).

  ## 0.2.1.0

  Added the `toHtml` and `toHtmlFile` functions which create the necessary
  HTML to view the  Vega-Lite visualization using
  [Vega Embed](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/usage/embed.html)
  (this is similar to how
  [ihaskell-hvega](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ihaskell-hvega)
  works).

  This functionality was provided by Gregory Schwartz; apologies for
  taking so long to get it released.

  ## 0.2.0.0

  The constructors for the LegendOrientation type have been renamed (by
  adding the prefix `LO`) which avoids the name clash with `Left` and `Right`
  seen in earlier releases. This is a breaking API change.

  Clarify how to use the library in the main `hvega` module.

  Thanks to contributions from Nicolas Mattia (nmattia) and Marco Zocca (ocramz).

  ## 0.1.0.3

  The only change is to the cabal file, where `cabal-version: >=1.18` has
  been changed to `cabal-version: 1.18`.

  ## 0.1.0.2

  Updated the upper bounds of `aeson` to really allow v1.4. This was not
  released on Hackage.

  ## 0.1.0.1

  Updated the upper bounds of `aeson` from v1.2 to v1.4.

  The cabal package now includes `stack.yaml` and `default.nix` (although
  the latter is *not* guaranteed to be correct), as well as a
  change log and an extra image.

  ## 0.1.0.0

  This is the initial version of `hvega`, which is based on
  version 2.2.1 of the
  [Elm Vega library](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/gicentre/elm-vega/2.2.1/VegaLite).

  # hvega

  Support the creation of [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) visualizations
  in Haskell. This code is released under the BSD3 license.

  It is an almost-direct copy of version 2.2.1 of the
  [Elm Vega library](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/gicentre/elm-vega/2.2.1/VegaLite),
  which is released under a BSD3 license by Jo Wood of the giCentre at the
  City University of London.

  ## Example

  ```Haskell
  let cars =  dataFromUrl "https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json" []

      enc = encoding
              . position X [ PName "Horsepower", PmType Quantitative ]
              . position Y [ PName "Miles_per_Gallon", PmType Quantitative ]
              . color [ MName "Origin", MmType Nominal ]

      bkg = background "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05)"

  in toVegaLite [ bkg, cars, mark Circle [], enc [] ]
  ```

  When viewed with a Vega-Lite aware viewer, the resultant plot is

  ![Simple scatterplot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DougBurke/hvega/master/hvega/images/intro.png "Simple scatterplot")

  ## Documentation

  The [Elm Vega documentation](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/gicentre/elm-vega/2.2.1)
  can be used as a guide to using this module. The
  [Vega-Lite Example Gallery](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/) has
  been converted to an
  [IHaskell notebook](https://github.com/DougBurke/hvega/blob/master/notebooks/VegaLiteGallery.ipynb)
  Uunfortunately the plots created by VegaEmbed **do not appear**
  in the notebook when viewed with either GitHub's viewer or
  [ipynb viewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/DougBurke/hvega/blob/master/notebooks/VegaLiteGallery.ipynb),
  but things seem much better when using Jupyter Lab (rather than
  notebook) to create the notebooks (since Vega is natively
  supported in this environment). The notebooks have been re-created
  using Jupyter Lab (thanks to Tweag I/O's
  [JupyterWith environment](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2019-02-28-jupyter-with.html)), which should make the plots appear on GitHub (you may need
  to reload the notebooks as I find they don't display on the
  first try).

  The [notebooks directory](https://github.com/DougBurke/hvega/tree/master/notebooks)
  contains a poorly-curated set of examples and experiments with hvega.

  ## Differences to Elm Vega

  The main changes to version 2.2.1 of
  [Elm Vega](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/gicentre/elm-vega/2.2.1)
  are:

  - Replace `Spec` by `VLSpec` (although both are synonyms for the underlying
    JSON representation).

  - Add a type for the output of `toVegaLite` (`VegaLite`) that is separate from
    `VLSpec`, which is usefull for integration with IHaskell. The JSON
    specification is retrieved with `fromVL`.

  - Take advantage of the lack of backwards compatibality requirements to remove or
    replace several symbols (such as add the `Utc` constructor to `TimeUnit`, remove the `bin`
    function, and use `Data` rather than `(VLProperty, VLSpec)` in function
    signatures).

  - In version 0.2.0.0, the constructors for the `LegendOrientation` type
    have gained a `LO` prefix, which avoids clashing with the Prelude's
    `Either` type.
