changelog: |
  **v0.1.0.0**

    * Initial release

  **v0.1.0.1**

    * Improve error messages when quasi-quoters are used in a
      non-expression context

  **v0.1.1.0**

    * Add functions for generating Template Haskell expressions
      to be spliced, as alternatives to using the quasi-quoters

  **v0.2.0.0**

    * Add Template Haskell splice patterns `d10Pat` and `d10ListPat`
    * Define `quotePat` for the quasi-quoters `d10` and `d10list`,
      so they can now be used with pattern matching
    * Add `Integral a` constraint to `d10` and `d10list` in the
      `Data.D10.Num` module, because this is needed for the
      definition of `quotePat`.

  **v0.2.0.1**

    * Add `CHANGELOG.md` to package distribution

  **v0.2.1.0**

    * Add functions mod-10 arithmetic functions: `(+)`, `(-)`, `(*)`

  **v0.2.1.2**

    * Support GHC 8.8

  **v0.2.1.4**

    * Support GHC 8.10

  **v0.2.1.6**

    * Support `doctest-0.17`

  **v0.3**

  In module `Data.D10.Char`:

    * Removed `isD10Str` (see `Data.D10.Predicate`)
    * Type of `d10Exp` changed
      from `Integral a => a -> Q Exp`
      to `Integer -> Q Exp`
    * Type of `d10Pat` changed
      from `D10 -> Q Pat`
      to `Integer -> Q Pat`
    * Type of `d10ListPat` changed
      from `[D10] -> Q Pat`
      to `String -> Q Pat`

  In module `Data.D10.Num`:

    * Removed `isD10Str` (see `Data.D10.Predicate`)
    * Type of `d10Exp` changed
      from `(Integral b, Lift a, Num a) => b -> Q Exp`
      to `Integer -> Q Exp`
    * Type of `d10ListExp` changed
      from `(Lift a, Num a) => String -> Q Exp`
      to `String -> Q Exp`
    * Type of `d10Pat` changed
      from `Integral a => D10 a -> Q Pat`
      to `Integer -> Q Pat`
    * Type of `d10ListPat` changed
      from `Integral a => [D10 a] -> Q Pat`
      to `String -> Q Pat`
    * Type of `d10` changed
      from `(Lift a, Integral a) => QuasiQuoter`
      to `QuasiQuoter`
    * Type of `d10list` changed
      from `(Lift a, Integral a) => QuasiQuoter`
      to `QuasiQuoter`
    * Although type variables no longer appear in the
      various Template Haskell functions, the expressions
      and patterns they generate are polymorphic.

  In module `Data.D10.Safe`:

    * The `D10` type now has instances of the `Data` and `Generic`.
    * Type of `d10ListPat` changed
      from `[D10] -> Q Pat`
      to `String -> Q Pat`
    * Removed `d10Exp`, `d10Pat`, and `d10`

  Other changes:

    * `doctest` test dependency has been removed, and
      `hedgehog` dependency has been added instead

  **v0.3.0.1**

    * Support GHC 9.0, base 4.15, template-haskell 2.17

  **v1**

  Removed the `Data` prefix from module names.

    * `Data.D10.Char` is now `D10.Char`
    * `Data.D10.Num` is now `D10.Num`
    * `Data.D10.Predicate` is now `D10.Predicate`
    * `Data.D10.Safe` is now `D10.Safe`

  Constructors for `D10` are no longer exported by the modules formerly
  known as `Data.D10.Char` and `Data.D10.Num`. They have moved to the
  new modules `D10.Char.Unsafe` and `D10.Num.Unsafe` respectively.

  Operators `(+)`, `(-)`, and `(*)` have been moved into their own
  separate modules, as the names conflict with `Prelude` functions.
  These new modules are:

    * `D10.Char.Arithmetic`
    * `D10.Num.Arithmetic`
    * `D10.Safe.Arithmetic`

  Other new modules:

    * `D10.Char.Conversions`
    * `D10.Char.Quotes`
    * `D10.Char.Splices`
    * `D10.Char.Type`
    * `D10.Num.Conversions`
    * `D10.Num.Quotes`
    * `D10.Num.Splices`
    * `D10.Num.Type`
    * `D10.Safe.Conversions`
    * `D10.Safe.Quotes`
    * `D10.Safe.Splices`
    * `D10.Safe.Type`

  All instances of the `Language.Haskell.TH.Syntax.Lift` class
  have been removed

  Added *Safe Haskell* language flags (`Safe`, `Trustworthy`, `Unsafe`)
  to indicate which modules permit constructing invalid values

  Required Cabal version required is raised from 2.2 to 3.0

  # d10

  Data types representing the digits zero through nine.

  ## Modules

  Each of the following modules defines a different type named `D10`, all of which are different representations of the same concept:

  * `D10.Char` - Defines a `D10` type as a newtype for `Char`, where the values are restricted to characters between `'0'` and `'9'`.
  * `D10.Num` - Defines a `D10` type as a newtype for any type with an instance of the `Num` class, where the values are restricted to numbers between `fromInteger 0` and `fromInteger 9`.
  * `D10.Safe` - Defines a `D10` type as `D0 | D1 | D2 | ... | D9`.

  ## Quasi-quoters

  Each module that defines a `D10` type also defines quasi-quoters for it. With the `QuasiQuotes` GHC extension enabled, a single digit like *7* can be written as `[d10|7|]`, and a list of digits like *[4,5,6]* can be written as `[d10|456|]`. For `D10.Char` and `D10.Num`, the quasi-quoters are an important feature, because the `D10` types defined in these modules have unsafe constructors, and the quasi-quoters provide compile-time assurance that we never construct a `D10` that represents a value outside the range *0* to *9*.
