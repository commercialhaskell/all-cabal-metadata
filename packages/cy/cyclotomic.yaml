description: |-
  The cyclotomic numbers are a subset of the
  complex numbers that are represented exactly, enabling exact
  computations and equality comparisons.  They
  contain the Gaussian rationals (complex numbers
  of the form p + q i with p and q rational), as well
  as all complex roots of unity.  The
  cyclotomic numbers contain the square roots of
  all rational numbers.  They contain the sine and
  cosine of all rational multiples of pi.
  The cyclotomic numbers form a field, being closed under
  addition, subtraction, mutiplication, and division.
