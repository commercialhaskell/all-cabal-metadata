description: |-
  A quasiquoter for raw string literals - that is, string literals that don't
  recognise the standard escape sequences (such as @\'\\n\'@). Basically, they
  make your code more readable by freeing you from the responsibility to
  escape backslashes. They are useful when working with regular expressions,
  DOS/Windows paths and markup languages (such as XML).

  See @examples/RawRegex.hs@ for a usage example.
