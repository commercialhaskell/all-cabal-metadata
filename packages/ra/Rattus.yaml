  0.5.0.1
  ---

  Compatibility with GHC 9.2.1

  0.5
  ---

  The typing rules for delay, functions, and guarded recursion have been
  simplified and generalised. Instead of just one tick, Rattus now
  allows an arbitrary number of ticks as well as function definitions in
  the scope of ticks. In practical terms, this means the following:

  - As before, delays can be nested arbitrarily and function definitions
    may occur under arbitrarily many delays.
  - But now the scope of a delay is no longer interrupted by a nested
    delay or function definition.

  0.4
  ---

  More general typing rules for delay, functions, and guarded recursion:

  - delay and function definitions may now occur under a delay.
  - Guarded recursive calls may occur at any time in the future -- not
    only exactly one time step into the future.
  - As before, adv and recursive calls may only occur directly in the
    scope of delay. The scope of a delay is interrupted by adv, box,
    guarded recursive definitions, and function definitions.

  Changes in the library:

  - Rename applicative-style operators to avoid clash with Haskell's <*>
    operator.
  - Rename types: Event -> Future; Events -> Event



  0.3.1
  -----

  Guarded recursive types Str and Event are now fully strict (i.e. in
  particular, they are strict in the component that is of a later type)
  as they should be.

  0.3
  ---

  Rattus code is now checked just after GHC's type checking phase
  (instead of after desugaring to Core). As a consequence, error
  messages for some corner cases are much improved and we don't need
  to use the -g2 compiler option anymore to get good error messages.

  0.2
  ---

  - the use of lazy data structures will now cause a warning (can be
    disabled by 'AllowLazyData' annotation); this check for lazy data is
    rather ad hoc and needs to be refined
  - allow functions under ticks (but with limitations, see paper)
  - strictness transformation is now similar to the 'Strict' language
    extension
  - optimisations using custom rewrite rules

  0.1.1.0
  -------

  - allow mutual guarded recursion
  - improve type error messages

description: |-
  This library implements the Rattus programming language as
  an embedded DSL. To this end the library provides a GHC
  plugin that performs the additional checks that are
  necessary for Rattus. What follows is a brief
  introduction to the language and its usage. A more
  detailed introduction can be found in this
  <src/docs/paper.pdf paper>.

  Rattus is a functional reactive programming (FRP) language
  that uses modal types to ensure operational properties
  that are crucial for reactive programs: productivity (in
  each computation step, the program makes progress),
  causality (output depends only on current and earlier
  input), and no implicit space leaks (programs do not
  implicitly retain memory over time).

  To ensure these properties, Rattus uses the type modality
  @O@ to express the concept of time at the type
  level. Intuitively speaking, a value of type @O a@
  represents a computation that will produce a value of type
  @a@ in the next time step. Additionally, the language also
  features the @Box@ type modality. A value of type @Box a@
  is a time-independent computation that can be executed at
  any time to produce a value of type @a@.

  For example, the type of streams is defined as

  > data Str a = a ::: (O (Str a))

  So the head of the stream is available now, but its tail
  is only available in the next time step. Writing a @map@
  function for this type of streams, requires us to use the
  @Box@ modality:

  > map :: Box (a -> b) -> Str a -> Str b
  > map f (x ::: xs) = unbox f x ::: delay (map f (adv xs))

  This makes sure that the function @f@ that we give to
  @map@ is available at any time in the future.

  The core of the language is defined in the module
  "Rattus.Primitives". Note that the operations on @O@ and
  @Box@ have non-standard typing rules. Therefore, this
  library provides a compiler plugin that checks these
  non-standard typing rules. To write Rattus programs, one
  must enable this plugin via the GHC option
  @-fplugin=Rattus.Plugin@, e.g. by including the following
  line in the source file:

  > {-# OPTIONS -fplugin=Rattus.Plugin #-}

  In addition, one must annotate the functions that are
  written in Rattus:

  > {-# ANN myFunction Rattus #-}

  Or annotate the whole module as a Rattus module:

  > {-# ANN module Rattus #-}

  Below is a minimal Rattus program using the
  "Rattus.Stream" module for programming with streams:

  > {-# OPTIONS -fplugin=Rattus.Plugin #-}
  >
  > import Rattus
  > import Rattus.Stream
  >
  > {-# ANN sums Rattus #-}
  > sums :: Str Int -> Str Int
  > sums = scan (box (+)) 0

  The
  <docs/src/Rattus.Stream.html source code of the Rattus.Stream module>
  provides more examples on how to program in Rattus.
