changelog: "# Change log for [raaz].\n\n## [0.2.3] - 25 April, 2021\n\nThis is a minor
  release just update package dependencies.\n\n* Get raaz to work with ghc-9.0\n\n##
  [0.2.2] - 13 December, 2020\n\nThis is a minor release just update package dependencies.\n\n*
  Get raaz to work with the latest ghcs.\n\n## [0.2.1] - 25 March, 2019\n\nThis is
  a minor release just to get the latest ghc.\n\n* Get raaz to work with latest ghcs.\n\n##
  [0.2.0] - 24 August, 2017\n\n* Some cpu detection builtin for GCC. Would come handy
  in future for\n  selection of primitives are runtime.\n* BLAKE2b, BLAKE2s added.\n*
  system entropy: Experimental support for linux getrandom call\n* removed depreciated
  `liftSubMT` from Memory.\n* Got rid of the class `MemoryMonad`, instead introduced
  a more specific\n  `MemoryThread`. This allows to treat monads like `RT mem` much
  like\n  `MT mem`, including possibility of running an action on a sub-memory.\n*
  combinator to randomise memory cells.\n* hardened the prg so that a compromise on
  the current prg state will\n  not expose previously generated data.\n* OpenBSD/NetBSD:
  fix incorrect arc4random call.\n* Basic Unix man-page for the raaz command.\n* Windows
  support is now included. The missing pieces were system\n  entropy and memory locking
  which is now available.\n\n## [0.1.1] - 2nd  March, 2017\n\n* Failing build on big
  endian machines (#306) fixed.\n\n## [0.1.0] - 28th February, 2017\n\n* Stream cipher
  chacha20 added.\n* Added a PRG that uses chacha20, seeded with system entropy\n*
  Sha1 highly depreciated in view of reported collision.\n* We now have super command
  `raaz` with subcommands\n  - `checksum`: as a replacement for the old checksum executable\n
  \ - `rand`: for generating random bytes.\n\nLow level changes\n\n* Reworked alignment
  considerations.\n\n  - New Alignment type\n\n  - Ways for implementations to demand
  that the input buffer be aligned\n\t(mainly to facilitate more efficient SIMD implementations).\n\n\n*
  Num instance from LengthUnit removed, Monoid instance added (See\n  issue:#247)\n\n\n##
  [0.0.2] - July 25, 2016.\n\nThis release comes with very little changes.\n\n* Encoding:
  translation between formats using the `translate`\n  combinator\n* Encoding formats:
  base64\n* Bug fix in base16 character verification (Commit: d6eca4c37b0b)\n* Dropped
  `isSuccessful` from export list of Equality.\n\n## [0.0.1] - June 21, 2016.\n\n*
  Basic cryptographic types.\n* Hashes: sha1, sha256, sha512, sha224, sha384 and their
  HMACs\n* Ciphers: AES-CBC with key-sizes 128, 192 and 256\n* Encoding formats: base16\n\n[0.0.1]:
  <http://github.com/raaz-crypto/raaz/releases/tag/v0.0.1>\n[0.0.2]: <http://github.com/raaz-crypto/raaz/releases/tag/v0.0.2>\n[0.1.0]:

  This is the repository of `raaz`, a Haskell library that implements
  some standard cryptographic primitives. This library is the basis on
  which we plan to build a cryptographic framework in Haskell. For
  example, there are plans to implement some common cryptographic
  protocols like `ssh`. Thus applications that require cryptographic
  security, in particular secure networking applications can be built
  out of this.

  Raaz is also an attempt to provide better security guarantees by
  making use of Haskell's strong typing. Besides, we put a lot of
  emphasis on better API design and good documentation which, we
  believe, makes the usage of the library secure.

  The word `Raaz` (&#x0930;&#x093E;&#x095B;) stands for secret in Hindi.

  Hacking and Discussion
  ----------------------

  * For hacking see our [github repository][repo].

  * For discussion see our [google groups][emailgroups] mailing list.

  * Hangout on irc.freenode.net (channel: #haskell-raaz).

  For details please refer to [our wiki][wiki].

  ## Releasing and reviewing.

  The repository also contains the file Releasing.md which contains
  checklist for releasing a new version of the library. Any crypto
  library should undergo through review by multiple people. In the file
  Reviewing.md, we collect some common pitfalls to look for while
  reviewing the code. It is good to actively look for some of the
  problems suggested there but of course one should also look for other
  problems.
