  !) to goal / to me\nw/W          Move designated player to left / right\ne/E          Move
  designated player forward / backward\na/A          Pass low / high (hold key for
  faster pass)\ns/S          Kick low / high (hold key for faster kick)\nd/D          Flip

  in (follow up to 37)\n48\tif controlled player throws in, then stop other player
  moving_to_throwin from grabbing the ball\n49\tBug: if team consists solely of non
  AI players, this line in ObjectBehaviour / player blows: let np = nearestNonAIPlayer
  myTeam vss pd\n51\tfor testing, it would be good to have an editor of some kind
  for game situations (player position,heading and speed, dito for ball)\n52\tGrid:
  If no best spot computable throws exception. Better to return „Maybe Spot“\n61\tBug:
  On throw in, player sometime comes to take the ball but then does not throw in\n67\tadd
