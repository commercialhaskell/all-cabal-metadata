description: ! 'Easy-to-use randomness for livecoding.


  The goal is to provide the simplest possible experience, e.g.


  > >>> import Rando


  > >>> pickOne ["lemon", "lime", "strawberry"]

  > "lime" :: IO String


  > >>> flipCoin

  > True


  > >>> shuffle [1..5]

  > [2,4,1,3,5]


  This library is in flux: names will change, types will change, functions

  will appear and disappear and move between modules!'
