changelog: ! "Change log\n==========\n\nv0.6.1.1 May 2016\n-----------------\n\n *
  Fix: GHC 8.0 bound fix\n\nv0.6.1 May 2015\n---------------\n\n * Fix: Correcting
  bytestring lower bounds\n\nv0.6 May 2015\n-------------\n\n * Adding: repeating
  background pattern texture.\n * Added: PDF output without images (for now)\n\nv0.5.2.1
  April 2015\n-------------------\n\n * Fixed: non-composability of cached elements\n
  * Fixed: Border size when drawing images was twice too large.\n\nv0.5.2 April 2015\n-----------------\n\n
  * Enhancement: Added a withGroupOpacity to render elements with\n   a global opacity.\n\nv0.5.1
  March 2015\n-----------------\n\n * Enhancement: Generalizing geometry description,
  with automatic\n   conversion, reducing the need of type constructor from Primitive,\n
  \  and directly filling Path.\n\nv0.5.0.3 February 2015\n----------------------\n\n
  * Fix: hackage documentation\n\nv0.5.0.2 February 2015\n----------------------\n
  * Removing test-suite as it's dependent of some repository-local files\n\nv0.5.0.1
  February 2015\n----------------------\n * Fix: adding missing Arbitrary file in
  the distribution.\n\nv0.5 February 2015\n------------------\n\n * Breaking Change:
  Font size is now a newtype in FontyFruity,\n   propagating the changes.\n * Allowing
  to specify DPI at the top level of the rendering\n   request.\n * Adding: an helper
  function to retrieve the distance to the\n * Changed: font size switched to float.\n\nv0.4.2
  February 2015\n--------------------\n * Fix: Cubic bezier clipping\n\nv0.4.1 January
  2015\n-------------------\n * Fix: GHC 7.10 compilation\n * Adding: Various lens
  to access some primitive informations.\n\nv0.4 December 2014\n------------------\n\n
  * Breaking change: Changed the original position scheme for\n   text, allowing to
  specify baseline or upper left corner\n\n * Tried: Fast forward differencing for
  cubic bezier, not worth\n   the hassle\n * Enhancement: Further optimized decomposition
  of all primitives,\n   less alocated memory.\n * Enhancement: After optimizing pixel
  writing, optimized pixel\n   reading, yielding non-negligeable speed improvements.\n
  * Added: an \"immediate\" module to avoid constructing\n   a scene tree.\n * Enhancement:
  Allowing both IO & (ST s) as drawing monads, enabling\n   interleaved drawing with
  io operations.\n * Added: a \"withPathOrientation\" function to orient primitives\n
  \  on a path (allow to draw curved text)\n * Added: toNewXBase transformation to
  create a new basis given\n   a X axis vector.\n * Added: a PathWalker module, to
  give access to the lower level\n   path orientation facility.\n * Added: some GHC
  rules for transformations\n * Added: a new text function: 'printTextRanges' to allow\n
  \  easier complex text rendering\n\nv0.3 June 2014\n--------------\n\n * Enhancement:
  Switching main free monad type to the church encoded one.\n * Enhancement: Optimized
  the bezier decomposition, strictness annotations\n   made wonders. May require forward
  differencing in the future.\n * Enhancement: Implementing specific decomposition
  for lines.\n * Enhancement: Reworked texture system, now allowing some specialized\n
  \  filler (hoping faster computation). For now only the\n   solid color has been
  optimized, and all the transformed\n   textures.\n * Enhancement: Fixing space leak
  in combineEdgeSamples, avoiding\n   many allocations.\n * Adding: bounding box calculation
  facility.\n * Adding: Exposing outline creation capability\n * Adding: a skewX &
  skewY transformation function.\n * Fixing: some numerical stability with the mitter
  join.\n\nv0.2.1 April 2014\n-----------------\n\n * Fixing: transparency in gradients.\n
  * Fixing: alpha composition on top of translucent\n   background.\n\nv0.2 April
  2014\n---------------\n\n * Adding: an ellipse helper.\n * Adding: a polyline helper.\n
  * Adding: a polygon helper.\n * Adding: monoid instance for Drawing.\n * Fixing:
  some stroking bug with cubic bezier curve.\n * Fixing: some documentation snippets.\n
  * Adding: a rounded rectangle helper.\n * Added: a even-odd filling rule.\n * Added:
  an offset for dashed stroking.\n * Added: a transformation module.\n * Change: Changed
  the Transformable typeclass, splitted\n   it in two.\n * Added: a dumping function
  for the constructed\n   drawing.\n * Adding: an image texture with bilinear filtering.\n
  * Adding: an image helper.\n * Enhancement: Some modest performance gain.\n\nv0.1
  February 2014\n------------------\n\n * Initial version.\n\n"

description: ! "Rasterific\n==========\n\n![Rasterific logo](https://raw.github.com/Twinside/Rasterific/master/img/logo.png)\n\n[![Build
  Status](https://travis-ci.org/Twinside/Rasterific.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Twinside/Rasterific)\n[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/Rasterific.svg)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Rasterific)\n\nRasterific
  is a Haskell rasterization engine (a vectorial renderer)\nimplemented on top of
  [JuicyPixels](https://github.com/Twinside/Juicy.Pixels).\nRasterific bases its text
  rendering on [FontyFruity](https://github.com/Twinside/FontyFruity).\n\nMain capability\n---------------\n\n
  * Draw vector graphics to an image.\n * Export graphics to PDF (since 0.6).\n\nDesign\n------\nThe
  renderer design is based on the\n[Nile](https://github.com/damelang/nile) /\n[Gezira](https://github.com/damelang/gezira)
  renderer from the STEP\nproject from the [VPRI](http://www.vpri.org/index.html)
  institute. The\ninteresting thing about this renderer is the conciseness of it's\nimplementation,
  providing antialiased rendering in the way.\n\n"
