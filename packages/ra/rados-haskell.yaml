description: |-
  These bindings do not cover the entire API, they support
  read, write, stat, creation, and unlinking with shared
  locks.

  You can perform these actions with combinations of sync,
  async, and atomic execution.

  The "System.Rados.Monadic" module is recommended for
  safety/ease of use.

  The "System.Rados.Base" module is possibly more flexible
  but requires you to clean up your own resources and track
  a lot of state.

  Note: To use atomic writes, you must build with the
  /atomic_writes/ build flag.

  Stability: These bindings are not as polished as they could be, but
  are in production use at Anchor Hosting as of Jan 2014.
