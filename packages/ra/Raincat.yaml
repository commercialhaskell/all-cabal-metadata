  # Raincat
  Game Creation Society - Fall 08

  https://www.gamecreation.org/

  ### Installation (Snap Store)
  Raincat is available in the Snap Store at: [![raincat](https://snapcraft.io/raincat/badge.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/raincat)

  It can be installed with:
  ```
  sudo snap install raincat
  ```

  After installation, Raincat can be launched from the Raincat desktop launcher, or with:
  ```
  snap run raincat
  ```

  ### Compilation
  You can compile locally with `runhaskell`:
  ```
  runhaskell Setup.lhs --user configure
  runhaskell Setup.lhs build
  runhaskell Setup.lhs install
  ```

  Compiling from Hackage with `cabal`:
  ```
  cabal install Raincat
  ```

  ### Starting the game (compiled)
  ```
  ./raincat
  ```

  ### Changelog
  ```
  Version 1.2:
      - Ported to SDL2
  Version 1.1:
      - Changed initial item placement from click to select, click to place
        to drag n' drop.
      - Replaced eraser tool with right click to erase an item
      - Now properly detecting mouse clicks after window resize
  Version 1.0:
      - Initial version
  ```

  ### Notes
  The Raincat executable was compiled with GHC 6.12.1 on Arch Linux i686
  and on Ubuntu 9.10. If you are having problems running the game, the
  win32 build runs under wine.

  Runtimes for the following libraries are assumed to be installed:
  * GLUT
  * OpenGL
  * SDL2
  * SDL2_image
  * SDL2_mixer

  ### Troubleshooting
  If you receive the error:
  ```
  user error (Mix_LoadMUS SDL message: Module format not recognized)
  ```
  when trying to run Raincat, this is because your SDL-mixer library
  was not compiled with mp3 support. You will need to recompile that
  with mp3 support or otherwise obtain a copy with mp3 support in order
  to run the game.
