  Raincat
  Game Creation Society - Fall 08
  www.gamecreation.org


  HOW TO START THE GAME:
  ----------------------
  ./raincat

  COMPILATION:
  ----------------------
  runhaskell Setup.lhs --user configure
  runhaskell Setup.lhs build
  runhaskell Setup.lhs install

  Alternative method: cabal install Raincat

  CHANGELOG:
  ----------
  Version 1.2:
      - Ported to SDL2
  Version 1.1:
      - Changed initial item placement from click to select, click to place
        to drag n' drop.
      - Replaced eraser tool with right click to erase an item
      - Now properly detecting mouse clicks after window resize
  Version 1.0:
      - Initial version


  NOTES:
  ------
  The Raincat executable was compiled with GHC 6.12.1 on Arch Linux i686
  and on Ubuntu 9.10. If you are having problems running the game, the
  win32 build runs under wine.

  Runtimes for the following libraries are assumed to be installed:
  GLUT
  OpenGL
  SDL2
  SDL2_image
  SDL2_mixer


  TROUBLESHOOTING:
  ----------------
  If you receive the error:
  "user error (Mix_LoadMUS SDL message: Module format not recognized)"
  when trying to run Raincat, this is because your SDL-mixer library
  was not compiled with mp3 support. You will need to recompile that
  with mp3 support or otherwise obtain a copy with mp3 support in order
  to run the game.
