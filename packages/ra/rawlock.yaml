  # RAWLock

  A writer-biased RAW lock.

  It allows for multiple readers to run concurrently with at most one appender, or
  a single writer running on isolation.

  The code is safe in the presence of async exceptions, meaning that each actor
  will cleanup after itself if an exception is received.
