description: "```\n                              __ \n.----.---.-.-----.----.---.-.|
  \ |\n|   _|  _  |__ --|  __|  _  ||  |\n|__| |___._|_____|____|___._||__|\n                                 \n```\n\n[![Build
  Status](https://travis-ci.org/soli/rascal.png)](https://travis-ci.org/soli/rascal)\n\nrascal
  is a command-line client for [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/).\n\nIt should work
  on any platform where Haskell runs (Linux, Mac OSX and Windows\nthrough MinGW),
  and aims at making available the whole reddit API (we're not\nthere yet…).\n\nIt
  sports colors, that should soon become configurable, and might not work\nunder Windows
  (based on ANSI escape sequences, through\n[ansi-terminal](https://github.com/batterseapower/ansi-terminal)).\n\nBy
  default it will open [/r/haskell](http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/new)\nsorted by
  \"new\", but you can provide another subreddit as argument on the\ncommand line\n\n```\n$
  rascal python\n```\n\nIt is also possible to define the default subreddit and the
  default sort\noption in an INI-style configuration file named `.rascalrc` in your
  HOME\ndirectory. For instance, it might contain the following (case-sensitive!):\n\n```\nsubreddit:
  programming\nlinkSort = controversial\ncommentSort: new\npageComments = True\n```\n\nHere
  is what rascal looks like when started, and when a _self_ link (marked\nwith a '♦')
  is chosen (`N` was pressed in this case). Non-self links and links\ndetected in
  posts will be opened in your default browser.\n\n![screenshot](https://github.com/soli/rascal/raw/master/screenshot.png)\n\nComments
  are shown threaded, with the order defined in the configuration file\n(defaulting
  to `new`), and one page at a time if `pageComments` is true\n(default). Comments,
  like posts, are formatted to avoid cutting words when\npossible.\n\n![threads](https://github.com/soli/rascal/raw/master/threads.png)\n\n###
  Notes\n\nIn case you wonder, my iTerm2 is using the dark\n[solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized)
  color scheme. The ASCII\ntitle was generated with `figlet -f chunky`. And the name
  comes from my own\npronunciation of `/r/haskell`.\n\n### Planned Features\n\n* Configuration
  for colors\n* OAuth2 login to reddit (subscribed/saved/etc.)\n* more tests\n\n##
  Disclaimer\n\nPlease note that rascal is my first Haskell project. As such, it is
  as much a\nfun experiment for me to discover the ecosystem and the idioms, than
  a really\nuseful project. TL;DR: YMMV.\n"
