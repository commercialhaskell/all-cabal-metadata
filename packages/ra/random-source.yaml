synopsis: Generic basis for random number generators
changelog: |
  * Changes in 0.3.0.11: Revert 0.3.0.10 changes (which accidentally removed the Random.Source.PureMT module and added an overlapping instance).

  * Changes in 0.3.0.8: Add MonadRandom instance for MWC generator and RWS transformer.

  * Changes in 0.3.0.6: Fixed overzealous fix in 0.3.0.5.  The people responsible for sacking the people who have been sacked, etc., have been sacked.

  * Changes in 0.3.0.5: Renamed some internal modules and accidentally some external ones too.  Whoops.  Please don't use this version, it will only end in tears.

  * Changes in 0.3.0.4: Fixed a typo that broke building with MTL-1

  * Changes in 0.3.0.3: Fixes for GHC's deprecation of Foreign.unsafePerformIO

  * Changes in 0.3.0.2: Fixes for GHC 7.2.*'s crazy Template Haskell changes.

description: |-
  Random number generation based on entropy sources
  able to produce a small but well-defined set of
  primitive variates.  Also includes facilities for
  \"completing\" partial implementations, making it
  easy to define new entropy sources in a way that
  is naturally forward-compatible.
