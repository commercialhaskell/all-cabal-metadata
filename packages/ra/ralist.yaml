  # 0.4.0.0

  * flipped the argument order for `Co.lookup` to be consistent between
  both flavors of RAList apis

  # 0.3.0.0
  * changed type from
    `lookupM :: forall (m :: * -> *) a. Monad m => Word64 -> Top a -> m a` to `lookupM :: forall a. Word64 -> Top a -> Either String a`
  * added `Data.RAList.Flip`, which flips the counting by having the zeroth index be the last element of the skew binary list,
  rather than the head element.

  # 0.2.1.0

  Random access list with a list compatible interface.
  Random access list have same complexity as lists with some exceptions,
  the notable one being that (!!) is O(log n) instead of O(n).
  RALists have to be finite.
