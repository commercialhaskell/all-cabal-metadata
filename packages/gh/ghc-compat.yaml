  This package contains a number of modules that are
  part of base in GHC.  The modules do not really belong
  in the MicroHs base library, but are used by some
  packages, e.g., os-string.

  The code comes from the GHC base library, but has been
  modified to compile with MicroHs.

  Do not use with GHC.

  To make a new version (ridiculously many steps):

   * increment version number in `ghc-compat.cabal`
   * create distribution: `cabal sdist`
   * upload to hackage: `cabal upload -p FILE`, where FILE was generated by the previous step
   * update the version number of `ghc-compat` in `MicroCabal/src/MicroCabal/Main.hs`
   * release a new MicroCabal
   * rebuild MicroHs/generated/mcabal.c
   * release a new MicroHs
