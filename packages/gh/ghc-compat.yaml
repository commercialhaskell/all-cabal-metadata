description: |
  This package contains a number of modules that are
  part of base in GHC.  The modules do not really belong
  in the MicroHs base library, but are used by some
  packages, e.g., os-string.

  The code comes from the GHC base library, but has been
  modified to compile with MicroHs.

  Do not use with GHC.
