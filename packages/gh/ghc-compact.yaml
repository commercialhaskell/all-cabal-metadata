description: ! 'This package provides minimal functionality for working with

  "compact regions", which hold a fully evaluated Haskell object graph.

  These regions maintain the invariant that no pointers live inside the struct

  that point outside it, which ensures efficient garbage collection without

  ever reading the structure contents (effectively, it works as a manually

  managed "oldest generation" which is never freed until the whole is

  released).


  Internally, the struct is stored a single contiguous block of memory,

  which allows efficient serialization and deserialization of structs

  for distributed computing.


  This package provides a low-level API; see also the </package/compact compact package>
  which provides a user-facing API.'
