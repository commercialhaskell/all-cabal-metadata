description: |-
  This package provides minimal functionality for working with
  "compact regions", which hold a fully evaluated Haskell object graph.
  These regions maintain the invariant that no pointers live inside the struct
  that point outside it, which ensures efficient garbage collection without
  ever reading the structure contents (effectively, it works as a manually
  managed "oldest generation" which is never freed until the whole is
  released).

  Internally, the struct is stored a single contiguous block of memory,
  which allows efficient serialization and deserialization of structs
  for distributed computing.

  This package provides a low-level API; see also the </package/compact compact package> which provides a user-facing API.
