  v0.6.1\n        * Support GHC 8.8 (alpha1)\n2019-03-01 v0.6\n        * Remove orphan
  MonadFail Identity instance\n\t* MonadFail TransformT instance is defined unconditionally\n\t*
  Generalise HasTransform (TransformT Identity) to\n\tMonad m => HasTransform (TransformT
  m)\n\t* Add hoistTransform function\n  The 0.6 changes are all thanks to @phadej\n2018-10-27
  v0.5.8.2\n\t* Support GHC 8.4.4 by selecting correct source directory\n2018-09-23
  v0.5.8.1\n\t* Sort out MonadFail usage for GHC 8.6.1\n2018-09-12 v0.5.8.0\n\t* Disable
  use of .ghc.env files when parsing. By @lspitzner\n2018-08-11 v0.5.7.0\n\t* Include
  support for GHC 8.6.1 beta 1\n2018-07-11 v0.5.7.0\n\t* Include support for GHC 8.6.1
  alpha 1\n2018-03-11 v0.5.6.1\n\t* Relax base constraints so tests can configure
  with GHC 8.4.1\n2018-01-27 v0.5.6.0\n\t* Support GHC 8.4 alpha2\n\t* Include test
  examples for GHC 8.2\n\t* Fix parseModuleFromString to correctly handle the sheband
  case (@lspitzner)\n2017-07-23 v0.5.5.0\n\t* Support GHC 8.2.1\n2017-05-17 v0.5.4.0\n\t*
  Support GHC 8.2 (rc2)\n2017-05-05 v0.5.3.1\n\t* Fix bug roundtripping optional semicolons
  on if statements.\n2017-02-07 v0.5.3.0\n\t* Support GHC 8.0.2\n\t* Correct the logic
  around RigidLayout to function as originally\n\tintended.\n\t* Introduce Pretty
  module to add default annotations to a bare AST\n\tfragment, so that it can be printed
  correctly via exactprint. In\n\tthis case, \"correct\" is defined as generating
  the same AST if\n\tparsed again, it may not be beautiful layout.\n\t* Expose some
  additional internal parsing options (@lspitzner)\n\n2016-07-24 v0.5.2.1\n\t* Remove
  additional files from release tarball\n\n2016-07-24 v0.5.2\n\t* Move annotations

  v0.5\n\t* Add new options to enable \"rigid\" layout rules. This makes the\n\tannotations
  more rigid in the sense that if you move AST fragments around\n\tit is more likely
  that their internal components will remain in the same\n\tposition relative to each
  other.\n\n\t* Fix a bug where files failed to parse if the file started with comments.\n\n\t*
  Fix a bug where \"[e||\" was turned into \"[||\"\n\n\n2015-11-15 v0.4.2\n\t* Fix
  round tripping of arrow notation using \">-\" and \">>-\".\n2015-09-28 v0.4.1\n\t*
  Revert removing cast from markLocated until further inspection in HaRe.\n2015-09-28
  v0.4.0.0\n\t* Rework HasDecls so that there are only instances for which it is\n\tidempotent.
  Provide functions for managing an LHsBind which is not\n\tidempotent, and performing
  general transformations on an AST\n\tincluding FunBinds.\n\t* Manage LHsDecl instances
  so that the Annotation always attaches\n\tto the wrapped item, so that they can
  be seamlessly used in a top\n\tlevel (wrapped) or local (unwrapped) context.\n\t*
  Tweak transformations based on HaRe integration.\n\t* This release supports the
  HaRe 8.0 release, which finally works\n\twith GHC 7.10.2\n\t* Rename `exactPrintWithAnns`
  to `exactPrint`. This will possibly\n\tbreak earlier client libraries, but is a
  simple rename.\n\t* Bring in semanticPrintM which allows wrapper functions to be\n\tprovided
  for the generated output, for use when emitting e.g. HTML\n\tmarked up source.\n\n2015-08-13
  v0.3.1.1\n\t* Add missing test files to sdist, closes #23\n\n2015-08-02 v0.3.1\n\n\t*
  Mark LHS at the beginning of HsCase and HsIf expressions\n\t* Mark trailing semi
  colons on ANN pragmas\n\t* Correctly mark trailing semi colons distinctly from internal
  semicolons\n\t* setPrecedingLinesDecl applies the setting to both the Decl and\n\t
  \ the item wrapped in the Decl.\n\n\n2015-07-20 v0.3\n\tSubstantial rework to manage
  changes introduced in GHC 7.10.2 rc2\n\tand beyond.\n\n\tSimplification of the core
  Annotation data type coupled with\n\tsimplification of the various phases, by @mpickering.\n\n\tIntroduction
  of initial Transform functions, driven by the needs\n\tof HaRe [1] and apply-refact
  [2] for applying hlint hints. Both of\n\tthese are currently works in progress,
  and this module is likely\n\tto change substantially in future releases.\n\n\tSupport
  for processing files making use of CPP.\n\n\tLinks\n\t[1] https://github.com/alanz/HaRe/tree/wip\n\t[2]
  https://github.com/mpickering/apply-refact\n\n2015-03-24 v0.2\n\tThis release contains
  a major rewrite of all internal modules.\n\n\tThe external interface has also changed
  significantly. A description is\n\tomitted.\n\n\t# Top-level changes\n\tThe most
  notable change is that the common structor of the modules known as\n\t`ExactPrint`
  and `Annotate` has been factored out into a common module\n\t(`Annotate`). The aforementioned
  modules are now known as `Delta` and\n\t`Print` and contain functions to interpret
  this common structure.\n\n\tThe top level module `ExactPrint` now just reexports
  a consistent interface\n\tfrom the base modules.\n\n\tIntroduced a new module `Lookup`
  which contains a mapping from AnnKeywordId\n\tto their String representation.\n\n\t#
  Internal Changes\n\n\t`Annotate` contains all the information about which annotations
  appear on\n\teach AST element. This is achieved by building up a syntax tree (using
  a\n\tfree monad) which can then be interpreted by programs requiring access to\n\tthis
  information.\n\n\t# Layout compensation\n\n\tThe method which compensates for layout
  rules has been clarified.\n\n\t\t1. When the Layout Flag is activated in `Annotate`,
  we mark\n\tthe current column as the start of the layout block.\n\n\t\t2. This is
  important when we move to a new line. We take the offset at\n\t\tthat current point
  to be the baseline and calculate the correct next\n\t\tposition based on this.\n\n\t\t3.
  This method is very general as one can think of a entire source file as\n\t\tobeying
  layout rules where the offset is equal to zero.\n\n\n2015-03-11 v0.1.1.0\n\tHandles
  indentation when the AST is edited\n\tMajor rework of internal monads by @mpickering\n2015-01-28
  v0.1.0.1\n\tUpdate cabal to prevent building with GHC 7.70,thanks @peti\n2015-01-24
  v0.1.0.0\n\tInitial release, for GHC 7.10 RC 2\n"

description: |-
  Using the API Annotations available from GHC 7.10.2, this
  library provides a means to round trip any code that can
  be compiled by GHC, currently excluding lhs files.

  It does this with a phased approach

  * Delta - converts GHC API Annotations into relative
  offsets, indexed by SrcSpan

  * Transform - functions to facilitate changes to
  the AST, adjusting the annotations generated in the
  Delta phase to suit the changes.

  * Print - converts an AST and its annotations to
  properly formatted source text.

  * Pretty - adds annotations to an AST (fragment) so that
  the output can be parsed back to the same AST.
