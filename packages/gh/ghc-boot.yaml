description: |-
  This library is shared between GHC, ghc-pkg, and other boot
  libraries.
  .
  A note about "GHC.Unit.Database": it only deals with the subset of
  the package database that the compiler cares about: modules
  paths etc and not package metadata like description, authors
  etc. It is thus not a library interface to ghc-pkg and is *not*
  suitable for modifying GHC package databases.
  .
  The package database format and this library are constructed in
  such a way that while ghc-pkg depends on Cabal, the GHC library
  and program do not have to depend on Cabal.
