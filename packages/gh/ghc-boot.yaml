description: ! 'This library is shared between GHC, @ghc-pkg@, and other boot

  libraries.


  A note about "GHC.PackageDb": it only deals with the subset of

  the package database that the compiler cares about: modules

  paths etc and not package metadata like description, authors

  etc. It is thus not a library interface to @ghc-pkg@ and is __not__

  suitable for modifying GHC package databases.


  The package database format and this library are constructed in

  such a way that while @ghc-pkg@ depends on @Cabal@, the GHC library

  and program do not have to depend on @Cabal@.'
