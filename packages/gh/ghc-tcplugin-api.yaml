synopsis: An API for type-checker plugins.
changelog: "\r\n# Version 0.3.0.0 (2021-08-04)\r\n\r\nAccount for changes in rewriting
  in GHC 9.4:\r\n\r\n  - rewriter plugins can no longer emit new Wanted constraints\r\n
  \   if they don't rewrite the type family application;\r\n  - coercions in the rewriter
  are now oriented left-to-right,\r\n    requiring `mkTyFamAppReduction` to be adapted.\r\n\r\n#
  Version 0.2.0.0 (2021-07-22)\r\n\r\nInitial release on Hackage.\r\n"

description: |-
  This library provides a streamlined monadic interface
  for writing GHC type-checking plugins.

  Each stage in a type-checking plugin (initialisation, solving, rewriting,
  shutdown) has a corresponding monad, preventing operations that are only
  allowed in some stages to be used in the other stages.
  Operations that work across multiple stages are overloaded across monads
  using MTL-like typeclasses.

  Some operations, like creating evidence for constraints or creating
  custom type error messages, are also simplified.

  Please refer to the <https://github.com/sheaf/ghc-tcplugin-api associated GitHub repository>
  for example usage.
