synopsis: An API for type-checker plugins.
changelog: "\r\n# Version 0.4.1.0 (2021-08-24)\r\n\r\n- Re-export a few GHC modules,
  such as GHC.Core.Make and GHC.Plugins.\r\n  These re-exports might be changed to
  be more selective in the future\r\n  to aid cross-version compatibility.\r\n\r\n#
  Version 0.4.0.0 (2021-08-24)\r\n\r\n- Adapt to GHC 9.4 changes in the `TcPluginSolveResult`
  datatype:\r\n  are now able to solve and emit constraints even when reporting\r\n
  \ a contradiction. This can help with error messages.\r\n  Unfortunately these extra
  constraints will be dropped in versions\r\n  of GHC prior to 9.4.\r\n\r\n- Add a
  utility module for name resolution using constrained traversals.\r\n\r\n- Add compatibility
  for GHC 8.10.\r\n\r\n# Version 0.3.1.0 (2021-08-09)\r\n\r\nEnsure that the coercions
  stored in `Reduction`s are always\r\noriented left-to-right, by making the internal
  rewriting compatibility layer\r\nalso use left-to-right coercions.\r\n\r\n# Version
  0.3.0.0 (2021-08-04)\r\n\r\nAccount for changes in rewriting in GHC 9.4:\r\n\r\n
  \ - rewriter plugins can no longer emit new Wanted constraints\r\n    if they don't
  rewrite the type family application;\r\n  - coercions in the rewriter are now oriented
  left-to-right,\r\n    requiring `mkTyFamAppReduction` to be adapted.\r\n\r\n# Version
  0.2.0.0 (2021-07-22)\r\n\r\nInitial release on Hackage.\r\n"

description: |-
  This library provides a streamlined monadic interface
  for writing GHC type-checking plugins.

  Each stage in a type-checking plugin (initialisation, solving, rewriting,
  shutdown) has a corresponding monad, preventing operations that are only
  allowed in some stages to be used in the other stages.
  Operations that work across multiple stages are overloaded across monads
  using MTL-like typeclasses.

  Some operations, like creating evidence for constraints or creating
  custom type error messages, are also simplified.

  Please refer to the <https://github.com/sheaf/ghc-tcplugin-api associated GitHub repository>
  for example usage.
