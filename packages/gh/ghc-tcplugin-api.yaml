description: |-
  This library provides a streamlined monadic interface
  for writing GHC type-checking plugins.

  Each stage in a type-checking plugin (initialisation, solving, rewriting,
  shutdown) has a corresponding monad, preventing operations that are only
  allowed in some stages to be used in the other stages.
  Operations that work across multiple stages are overloaded across monads
  using MTL-like typeclasses.

  Some operations, like creating evidence for constraints or creating
  custom type error messages, are also simplified.

  Please refer to the <https://github.com/sheaf/ghc-tcplugin-api associated GitHub repository>
  for example usage.
