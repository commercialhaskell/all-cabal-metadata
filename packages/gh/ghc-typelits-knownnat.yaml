  ## 0.2.3 *January 15th 2017*
  * Solve normalised literal constraints, i.e.:
    * `KnownNat (((addrSize + 1) - (addrSize - 1))) ~ KnownNat 2`

  ## 0.2.2 *September 29th 2016*
  * New features:
    * Derive smaller constraints from larger constraints when they differ by a single variable, i.e. `KnownNat (a + b), KnownNat b` implies `KnownNat a`.

  ## 0.2.1 *August 19th 2016*
  * Fixes bugs:
    * Source location of derived wanted constraints is, erroneously, always set to line 1, column 1

  ## 0.2 *August 17th 2016*
  * New features:
    * Handle `GHC.TypeLits.-`
    * Handle custom, user-defined, type-level operations
    * Thanks to Gabor Greif (@ggreif): derive smaller from larger constraints, i.e. `KnownNat (n+1)` implies `KnownNat n`

  ## 0.1.2
  * New features: Solve "complex" KnownNat constraints involving arbitrary type-functions, as long as there is a given KnownNat constraint for this type functions.

  ## 0.1.1 *August 11th 2016*
  * Fixes bug: panic on a non-given KnownNat constraint variable

  ## 0.1 *August 10th 2016*
  * Initial release

  # ghc-typelits-knownnat

  [![Build Status](https://github.com/clash-lang/ghc-typelits-knownnat/actions/workflows/haskell-ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/clash-lang/ghc-typelits-knownnat/actions)

  [![Hackage Dependencies](https://img.shields.io/hackage-deps/v/ghc-typelits-knownnat.svg?style=flat)](http://packdeps.haskellers.com/feed?needle=exact%3Aghc-typelits-knownnat)

  A type checker plugin for GHC that can derive "complex" `KnownNat`
  constraints from other simple/variable `KnownNat` constraints. i.e. without this
  plugin, you must have both a `KnownNat n` and a `KnownNat (n+2)` constraint in
  the type signature of the following function:

  ```haskell
  f :: forall n . (KnownNat n, KnownNat (n+2)) => Proxy n -> Integer
  f _ = natVal (Proxy :: Proxy n) + natVal (Proxy :: Proxy (n+2))
  ```

  Using the plugin you can omit the `KnownNat (n+2)` constraint:

  ```haskell
  f :: forall n . KnownNat n => Proxy n -> Integer
  f _ = natVal (Proxy :: Proxy n) + natVal (Proxy :: Proxy (n+2))
  ```

  The plugin can derive `KnownNat` constraints for types consisting of:

  * Type variables, when there is a corresponding `KnownNat` constraint
  * Type-level naturals
  * Applications of the arithmetic expression: `{+,-,*,^}`
  * Type functions, when there is either:
    * a matching given `KnownNat` constraint; or
    * a corresponding `KnownNat<N>` instance for the type function

  To elaborate the latter points, given the type family `Min`:

  ```haskell
  type family Min (a :: Nat) (b :: Nat) :: Nat where
    Min 0 b = 0
    Min a b = If (a <=? b) a b
  ```

  the plugin can derive a `KnownNat (Min x y + 1)` constraint given only a
  `KnownNat (Min x y)` constraint:

  ```haskell
  g :: forall x y . (KnownNat (Min x y)) => Proxy x -> Proxy y -> Integer
  g _ _ = natVal (Proxy :: Proxy (Min x y + 1))
  ```

  And, given the type family `Max`:

  ```haskell
  type family Max (a :: Nat) (b :: Nat) :: Nat where
    Max 0 b = b
    Max a b = If (a <=? b) b a
  ```

  and corresponding `KnownNat2` instance:

  ```haskell
  instance (KnownNat a, KnownNat b) => KnownNat2 "TestFunctions.Max" a b where
    natSing2 = let x = natVal (Proxy @a)
                   y = natVal (Proxy @b)
                   z = max x y
               in  SNatKn z
    {-# INLINE natSing2 #-}
  ```

  the plugin can derive a `KnownNat (Max x y + 1)` constraint given only a
  `KnownNat x` and `KnownNat y` constraint:

  ```haskell
  h :: forall x y . (KnownNat x, KnownNat y) => Proxy x -> Proxy y -> Integer
  h _ _ = natVal (Proxy :: Proxy (Max x y + 1))
  ```

  To use the plugin, add the

  ```
  OPTIONS_GHC -fplugin GHC.TypeLits.KnownNat.Solver
  ```

  Pragma to the header of your file.
