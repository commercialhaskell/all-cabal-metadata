  # ghc-tags

  [![Build Status](https://github.com/arybczak/ghc-tags/workflows/Haskell-CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/arybczak/ghc-tags/actions?query=branch%3Amaster)
  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/ghc-tags.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-tags)

  A command line tool that generates etags (Emacs) and ctags (Vim and other
  editors) for efficient code navigation (jump to definition).

  Main features:
  * Leverages GHC API to obtain accurate information.
  * Uses multiple CPU cores when processing source files.
  * Supports fast incremental updates.

  Supported file extensions:
  * `.hs`
  * `.hs-boot`
  * `.lhs`
  * `.x` (requires `alex`)
  * `.hsc` (requires `hsc2hs`)

  ## Usage

  For simple projects, i.e. the ones that don't use C pre-processor in non-trivial
  ways nor include any C sources it should be enough to execute `ghc-tags -e` (for
  etags) or `ghc-tags -c` (for ctags) in the root directory of the project.

  For more complicated projects you need to create the configuration file
  (`ghc-tags.yaml` by default). It can contain the following keys:

  * `source_paths` - a list of paths for `ghc-tags` to process. Directories are
    traversed recursively.
  * `exclude_paths` - a list of paths for `ghc-tags` to exclude from processing.
  * `language` - the flavour of Haskell, either `Haskell98` or `Haskell2010`.
  * `extensions` - a list of GHC language extensions to enable when parsing. Note
    that GHC needs much less extensions for parsing alone, so you should almost
    never need to override this.
  * `cpp_includes` - include paths for the C pre-processor.
  * `cpp_options` - other options for the C pre-processor, e.g. defines (usually
    undefined `MIN_VERSION_x` macros will go here).

  If any of these keys is not specified, an appropriate default value will be
  picked instead. You can inspect the defaults by executing `ghc-tags --default`.

  **Note:** it is possible to specify multiple project configurations in the
  configuration file by separating them with `---`. For example, here is a
  configuration for GHC on Linux (compiler, utils and base):

  ```yaml
  source_paths:
  - compiler

  cpp_includes:
  - _build/stage1/compiler/build
  - compiler
  - includes/dist-derivedconstants/header

  ```
