  [![Windows Build Status](https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/ndmitchell/ghcid.svg?label=Windows%20build)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ndmitchell/ghcid)\n\nEither
  \"GHCi as a daemon\" or \"GHC + a bit of an IDE\". To a first approximation, it
  opens `ghci` and runs `:reload` whenever your source code changes, formatting the
  output to fit a fixed height console. Unlike other Haskell development tools, `ghcid`
  is intended to be _incredibly simple_. In particular, it doesn't integrate with
  any editors, doesn't depend on GHC the library and doesn't start web servers.\n\n_Acknowledgements:_
  This project incorporates significant work from [JPMoresmau](https://github.com/JPMoresmau),
  who is listed as a co-author.\n\n### Using it\n\nRun `cabal update && cabal install
  ghcid` to install it as normal. Then run `ghcid --height=8 --topmost \"--command=ghci
  Main.hs\"`. The `height` is the number of lines you are going to resize your console
  window to (defaults to height of the console). The `topmost` is to make the window
  sit above all others, which only works on Windows. The `command` is how you start
  your project in `ghci`. If you omit `--command` then it will default to `stack ghci`
  if you have the `stack.yaml` file and `.stack-work` directory, default to `ghci`
  if you have a `.ghci` file in the current directory, and otherwise default to `cabal
  repl`.\n\nPersonally, I always create a `.ghci` file at the root of all my projects,
  which usually [reads something like](https://github.com/ndmitchell/ghcid/blob/master/.ghci):\n\n
  \   :set -fwarn-unused-binds -fwarn-unused-imports\n    :set -isrc\n    :load Main\n\nAfter
  that, resize your console and make it so you can see it while working in your editor.
  On Windows the console will automatically sit on top of all other windows. On Linux,
  you probably want to use your window manager to make it topmost or use a [tiling
  window manager](http://xmonad.org/).\n\n### What you get\n\nOn every save you'll
  see a list of the errors and warnings in your project. It uses `ghci` under the
  hood, so even relatively large projects should update their status pretty quickly.
  As an example:\n\n    Main.hs:23:10:\n        Not in scope: `verbosit'\n        Perhaps
  you meant `verbosity' (imported from System.Console.CmdArgs)\n    Util.hs:18:1:
  Warning: Defined but not used: `foo'\n\nOr, if everything is good, you see:\n\n
  \   All good\n\nPlease [report any bugs](https://github.com/ndmitchell/ghcid/issues)
  you find.\n\n### FAQ\n\n* _This isn't as good as full IDE._ I've gone for simplicity
  over features. It's a point in the design space, but not necessarily the best point
  in the design space for you. For \"real\" IDEs see [the Haskell wiki](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/IDEs).\n*
  _If I delete a file and put it back it gets stuck._ Yes, that's a [bug in GHCi](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/9648).
  If you see GHCi getting confused just kill `ghcid` and start it again.\n"
