  [![Windows Build Status](https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/ndmitchell/ghcid.svg?label=Windows%20build)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ndmitchell/ghcid)\n\nEither
  \"GHCi as a daemon\" or \"GHC + a bit of an IDE\". To a first approximation, it
  opens `ghci` and runs `:reload` whenever your source code changes, formatting the
  output to fit a fixed height console. Unlike other Haskell development tools, `ghcid`
  is intended to be _incredibly simple_. In particular, it doesn't integrate with
  any editors, doesn't depend on GHC the library and doesn't start web servers.\n\n_Acknowledgements:_
  This project incorporates significant work from [JPMoresmau](https://github.com/JPMoresmau),
  who is listed as a co-author.\n\n### Using it\n\nRun `cabal update && cabal install
  ghcid` to install it as normal. Then run `ghcid \"--command=ghci Main.hs\"`. The
  `command` is how you start your project in `ghci`. If you omit `--command` then
  it will default to `stack ghci` if you have the `stack.yaml` file and `.stack-work`
  directory, default to `ghci` if you have a `.ghci` file in the current directory,
  and otherwise default to `cabal repl`.\n\nPersonally, I always create a `.ghci`
  file at the root of all my projects, which usually [reads something like](https://github.com/ndmitchell/ghcid/blob/master/.ghci):\n\n
  \   :set -fwarn-unused-binds -fwarn-unused-imports\n    :set -isrc\n    :load Main\n\nAfter
  that, resize your console and make it so you can see it while working in your editor.
  On Windows you may wish to pass `--topmost` so the console will sit on top of all
  other windows. On Linux, you probably want to use your window manager to make it
  topmost or use a [tiling window manager](http://xmonad.org/).\n\n### What you get\n\nOn
  every save you'll see a list of the errors and warnings in your project. It uses
  `ghci` under the hood, so even relatively large projects should update their status
  pretty quickly. As an example:\n\n    Main.hs:23:10:\n        Not in scope: `verbosit'\n
  \       Perhaps you meant `verbosity' (imported from System.Console.CmdArgs)\n    Util.hs:18:1:
  Warning: Defined but not used: `foo'\n\nOr, if everything is good, you see:\n\n
  \   All good\n\nPlease [report any bugs](https://github.com/ndmitchell/ghcid/issues)
  you find.\n\n### Ghcid Integration\n\nThere are a few plugins that integrate Ghcid
  into editors, notably:\n\n* [VS Code](plugins/vscode/)\n* [nvim](plugins/nvim/)\n*
  [Emacs](plugins/emacs/)\n\nAnd a blog article on using it:\n\n* [Auto-reload threepenny-gui
  apps during development](https://binarin.ru/post/auto-reload-threepenny-gui/)\n\n###
  FAQ\n\n* _This isn't as good as full IDE._ I've gone for simplicity over features.
  It's a point in the design space, but not necessarily the best point in the design
  space for you. For \"real\" IDEs see [the Haskell wiki](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/IDEs).\n*
  _If I delete a file and put it back it gets stuck._ Yes, that's a [bug in GHCi](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/9648).
  If you see GHCi getting confused just kill `ghcid` and start it again.\n* _I want
  to run my tests when files change._ You can pass any `ghci` expression with the
  `--test` flag, e.g. `--test=:main`, which will be run whenever the code is warning
  free (or pass `--warnings` for when the code is merely error free).\n* _I want to
  run arbitrary commands when arbitrary files change._ This project reloads `ghci`
  when files loaded by `ghci` change. If you want a more general mechanism something
  like [Steel Overseer](https://github.com/schell/steeloverseer) or [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/)
  will probably work better.\n* _I want syntax highlighting in the error messages._
  One option is to use Neovim or Emacs and run the terminal in a buffer whose file
  type is set to Haskell. Another option is to pipe `ghcid` through [source-highlight](https://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/)
  (`ghcid | source-highlight -s haskell -f esc`).\n* _I'm not seeing pattern matching
  warnings._ Ghcid automatically appends `-fno-code` to the command line, which makes
  the reload cycle about twice as fast. Unfortunately GHC 8.0 suffers from [bug 10600](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/10600)
  which means `-fno-code` also disables pattern matching warnings. Until that GHC
  bug is fixed either accept no pattern match warnings or use `-c` to specify a command
  line to start `ghci` that doesn't include `-fno-code`.\n* _I get \"During interactive
  linking, GHCi couldn't find the following symbol\"._ This problem is a manifestation
  of [GHC bug 8025](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/8025), which is fixed
  in GHC 8.4 and above. Ghcid automatically appends `-fno-code` to the command line,
  but for older GHC's you can supress that with `--test \"return ()\"` (to add a fake
  test) or `-c \"ghci ...\"` to manually specify the command to run.\n* _I only see
  source-spans or error messages on errors/warnings after the first load._ Due to
  limitations in `ghci`, these flags are only set _after_ the first load. If you want
  them to apply from the start, pass them on the command line to `ghci` with something
  like `-c \"ghci -ferror-spans -fdiagnostics-color=always\".\n"
