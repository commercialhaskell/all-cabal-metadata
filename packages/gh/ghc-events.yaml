  ## 0.9.1 - 2019-09-03

  * Relax upper version bounds to support GHC 8.8.1 ([#49](https://github.com/haskell/ghc-events/pull/49) and [#51](https://github.com/haskell/ghc-events/pull/51))

  * Export HeapProfBreakdown, HeapProfFlags, and PID types ([#35](https://github.com/haskell/ghc-events/pull/35))

  ## 0.7.0 - 2017-10-04

  * Add support for heap profiling events ([#29](https://github.com/haskell/ghc-events/pull/29))

  ## 0.6.0 - 2017-05-31

  This contains breaking changes.

  * The deprecation notice on `readEventLogFromFile` has been retracted
  * The incremental API has been refactored

  The details are as follows:

  * Update bug tracker URL ([#10](https://github.com/haskell/ghc-events/pull/10))
  * New test for Eden events ([#11](https://github.com/haskell/ghc-events/pull/11))
  * Relax version bound for binary ([#15](https://github.com/haskell/ghc-events/pull/15))
  * Enable Travis CI ([#19](https://github.com/haskell/ghc-events/pull/19))
  * Refactor the incremental API which was introduced in 0.5.0.0 ([#22](https://github.com/haskell/ghc-events/pull/22))
  * Some speed/memory usage improvements ([#18](https://github.com/haskell/ghc-events/pull/18), [#22](https://github.com/haskell/ghc-events/pull/22))

  ## 0.5.0.0 - unreleased

  * Readme added :)
  * Old parser replaced with an incremental implementation
  * General overhaul of the codebase
  * Partial Haddock coverage

  The 0.5.* releases should be able to handle large event logs and logs that have been cut off abruptly, e.g. from executable runs that resulted in crashes.

  This release should be *mostly* backwards compatible, however the "old" way of reading event logs, namely the `readEventLogFromFile`  function is now **deprecated**.

  **NOTE:** Users parsing large logs may notice that this version of the library is noticably slower than the older versions. The incremental parser is at fault here - previous versions of the libray used a "trick" that would let them essentially skip the first step of the mergesort algorithm since `EventBlock`s were already sorted in time order. The new parser reads the file incrementally and cannot take the advantage of this. Apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused.

  # ghc-events
  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/haskell/ghc-events.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/haskell/ghc-events)
  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/ghc-events.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-events)
  [![Hackage-Deps](https://img.shields.io/hackage-deps/v/ghc-events.svg)](http://packdeps.haskellers.com/feed?needle=ghc-events)

  A Haskell library for parsing .eventlog files emitted by the GHC runtime system.
  The package also includes an executable, `ghc-events` that can be used to display the contents of .eventlog files

  ## TODO
  * Add example usage/tutorial of the new API to this readme

  ## Known Issues
  * Writing event logs back to file does not work. It is hard to say how long has this been broken or how difficult will it be to fix ([#14](https://github.com/haskell/ghc-events/issues/14))
