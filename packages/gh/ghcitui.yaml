  # Revision history for ghcitui

  ## 0.4.0.0 -- 2024-11-15

  ### New features

  - Interruptable expressions! This was a huge rework of the code. You can now press `Ctrl+c`
    and expression evaluation will be interrupted! Very handy for avoiding hanging.
    See [GitHub Issue #49](https://github.com/CrystalSplitter/ghcitui/issues/49) for details.

  ### API changes

  Large overhaul in general, as GHCiTUI has moved to an async daemon scheduling model.

  - **Ghcitui.Brick**
    - Introduction of the new `CustomAppEvent` to handle new event handling.
    - The `brickApp` now specifies a `CustomAppEvent`.
    - Moved event utils to `EventUtils.hs`
    - Separated out `Events.hs` into `InterpWindowEvents.hs` and `SourceWindowEvents.hs`.
    - Introduced the callback functions `handleSourceWindowPostCb` and `interpWindowPostCb`.
  - **Ghcitui.Core**
    - Removed the `run` command as it was misleading in an asynchronous context. Replaced with
      `threadUnsafeRun`.
    - Added the `schedule` and `scheduleWithCb` functions, which mostly replace the intent
      of `run`, but work with async.
    - Added `interruptDaemon` to call the interrupt signal.
    - `emptyInterpreterState` now must be run under `IO`, as it must set up the lock.
    - Added `readyToExec` to check if the `ghci` handle lock is taken.

  In general, lots of doc fixes.

  ### Bug fixes

  - Fixed a bug where the module display wouldn't reveal the source in the `Source Window`.
    when there was only one module. See [GitHub Issue #48](https://github.com/CrystalSplitter/ghcitui/issues/48)
    for details.

  ### Known issues

  See https://github.com/CrystalSplitter/ghcitui/issues for the latest issues.

  - Inability to suspend operation through `Ctrl+z`.

  ## 0.3.0.0 -- 2024-03-17

  ### API changes

  - **Ghcitui.Brick**
    - Large rework of SourceWindow's end calculation.
      - Removed `updateSrcWindowEnd`, replaced with `updateVerticalSpace`.
      - Added `srcWindowLineDiffCount`.

  ### Bug fixes

  - Can now parse functions with apostraphes in names. (Issue #38)
  - Switching between files when updating contexts now snaps to the stopped line (Issue #41)

  ### Known issues

  See https://github.com/CrystalSplitter/ghcitui/issues for the latest issues.

  - Unable to interrupt expressions (fixed in 0.4.0.0)
  - Inability to suspend operation through `Ctrl+z`.

  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2024-02-11

  ### New features

  - Rudimentary tab completion! (credit: https://github.com/bradrn)

  ### API changes

  - **Ghcitui.Brick**
    - Added functions to support tab completion.
  - **Ghcitui.Core**
    - Added `Ghcitui.Ghcid.ParseTabCompletions` module.
    - Added `Ghcitui.Ghcid.Daemon.tabComplete`.
    - Moved ParseError to its own module (`Ghcitui.Ghcid.ParseError`).
    - Removed lazy data fields in records in
      - `Ghcitui.Ghcid.Daemon.BreakpointArg`
      - `Ghcitui.Ghcid.Daemon.InterpState`
      - Possibly a few more
  - **Other**
    - Update version for `vty`.

  ### Bug fixes

  - Fix issue with CRLF line endings caused weird source viewer wrapping behaviour.

  ### Misc

  - Added help message on start up splash to mention '?' keybinding.
  - Increased the cabal `tested-with` range.

  ### Known issues

  See https://github.com/CrystalSplitter/ghcitui/issues for the latest issues.

  - Can't parse functions with apostrophes in names. (Issue #38) (fixed in 0.3.0.0)
  - Switching between files when updating contexts does not snap to the stopped line (Issue #41)
    (fixed in 0.3.0.0)
  - Unable to interrupt expressions (fixed in 0.4.0.0)
  - Inability to suspend operation through `Ctrl+z`.

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2024-01-21

  First release! This is a "public beta" release, which we try to get feedback for higher priority
  features.

  ### Features

  - The public Ghcitui library.
  - Ghcid connection set up.
  - Source code viewer.
  - GHCi REPL
  - Current Bindings.
  - Available Modules.
  - Tracing.
  - Debug console.

  ### Bug fixes

  - None--this is the first release.

  ### Known issues

  (See https://github.com/CrystalSplitter/ghcitui/issues for the latest issues.)

  - Occasionally we get a SEGV on start up. Uncertain why. Very infrequent--likely a race condition
    in Vty or GHCiD?
  - String variables which contain quotes are not parsed correctly.
  - Unable to interrupt expressions (fixed in 0.4.0.0)
  - Currently no remapping of keybindings or colours.
  - CRLF line endings don't work (fixed in 0.2.0.0)
  - Inability to suspend operation through `Ctrl+z`.

  ![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/CrystalSplitter/ghcitui/haskell.yaml) ![Hackage Version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/ghcitui)

  This is an experimental front-end terminal interface for
  `ghci`. It provides a source viewer, keybindings, an interactive
  interpreter, and a local context viewer.

  ## Installation

  You can install this project from Hackage using `cabal` or from source. See [INSTALLATION] for details.

  ## Basic Usage

  For full usage, please see the [manual].

  ### Starting the TUI

  GHCiTUI runs a repl in the current directory by default.

  ```bash
  $ cd your/cabal/project/root/directory
  $ ghcitui
  ```

  You can specify another directory with the `-C <DIR>` flag.

  ```bash
  $ ghcitui -C some/other/directory
  ```

  ### Quitting the TUI

  Press `<ESC>` or `q` while in the code viewport panel to quit. While not in the
  code viewport panel, you may press `<ESC>` to get to the viewport panel.
