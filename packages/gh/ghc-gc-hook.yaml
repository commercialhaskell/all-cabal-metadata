  # Revision history for ghc-gc-hook


  ## 0.2.1.0 -- 2022-06-03

  * Now allows the host program to use TemplateHaskell, but the GC hook cannot be
    used inside a splice. The issue is that the `rtsConfig` symbol is not
    available inside a TH splice, so we need to use weak symbols to make it work.


  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2022-04-25

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

description: |-
  GHC exposes an API for calling a user-defined C function after every garbage
  collection pass. This small library gives access to this source of
  information from Haskell in a bare-bones form; furthermore, it gives a small
  usability improvement for running your own function from C using the hook
  from this library.
