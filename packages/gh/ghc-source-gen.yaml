  # Changelog for haskell-syntax

  ## 0.2.0.1
  - Bump upper-bound to allow `QuickCheck-2.13`.

  ## 0.2
  - Improve overall documentation..
  - Move `patBind` to a new `HasPatBind` class so that it can be used
    with `let'` and `while'`.
  - Remove `GHC.SourceGen.Syntax` and export types from relevant modules
    (for example, `HsType'` from `GHC.SourceGen.Type`).
  - Refactor the treatment of names:
      - Rename the constructors of `RdrNameStr`.
      - Make some combinators take `OccNameStr` instead of `RdrNameStr`, and
        introduce the `BVar` class for patterns.
      - Add `Eq` and `Ord` instances.
  - Support more kinds of syntax:
      - Deriving clauses
      - Import/export lists
      - Record expressions and patterns
      - Type family instances
      - Pattern synonyms (currently, only the prefix form)
  - Refactor the names and types of `match` and related combinators,
    optimizing for the common case of a single expression on the RHS.
  - Fix edge cases when parsing qualified operators.
  - Add parentheses in some cases that were previously missing them.
  - Make `==>` have the same precedence as `-->` to make it easier to
    combine them.
  - Make `tyApp`'s precedence match `-XTypeApplications`.
  - Fix pretty-printing of rational literals.
  - Make `tyPromotedVar` pretty-print as `'Abc` not `Abc`.
  - Add `conP_` for pattern constructors with no arguments.

  # ghc-source-gen

  `ghc-source-gen` is a Haskell library for generating Haskell source files and
  code fragments.  It uses GHC's [library API] to support the latest syntax, and
  provides a simple, consistent interface across several major versions of GHC.

  To get started, take a look at the [example](#example) below, or check out the
  `GHC.SourceGen` module.

  This package is not an officially supported Google product.

  [library API]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc

  ## Example

  The following example creates a module that defines the
  `const` function:

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE NoMonomorphismRestriction #-}
  import GHC.SourceGen
  import GHC.Paths (libdir)

  constModule :: HsModule'
  constModule =
      module' (Just "Const") (Just [var "const"]) []
          [ typeSig "const" $ a --> b --> a
          , funBind "const" $ match [wildP, x] x
          ]
    where
      a = var "a"
      b = var "b"
      x = bvar "x"

  main = runGhc (Just libdir) $ putPpr constModule
  ```

  The output of that program is:

  ```
  module Const (
          const
      ) where
  const :: a -> b -> a
  const _ x = x
  ```

  ## Comparison with the GHC API

  The raw GHC API has several complexities that `ghc-source-gen` simplifies for the
  purpose of source code generation.

  ### Backwards-compatibility
  `ghc-source-gen` provides the same API across several versions of GHC.  Code written
  with `ghc-source-gen` should compile unchanged on each of those versions.

  Currently, this library supports GHC versions 8.2, 8.4, 8.6 and 8.8.

  One caveat: `ghc-source-gen` supports some forms of syntax
  which are not implemented by all of those GHC versions.  For example, the
  `DerivingVia` extension is only implemented in `ghc >= 8.6`.  When built on
  older versions of GHC, `ghc-source-gen` will omit functions for constructing
  that syntax (for example: `GHC.SourceGen.Decl.derivingVia`).  We will also tag
  any such function with a note in its Haddock documentation.

  ### Less verbose types and construction functions

  The datatypes that GHC uses to represent Haskell syntax change their
  representation at different stages of the compilation: for example, parsing,
  renaming, or type-checking.  That data transformation provides type safety and
  a uniform structure across the phases.  However, it also adds unnecessary
  complexity to the task of source code generation.

  `ghc-source-gen` aims to provide a simple interface by creating data types as
  GHC would represent them immediately after its *parsing* step.  For example,
  `ghc >= 8.4` uses a type parameter `p` in its syntax types: `HsExpr p` for
  expressions, `HsDecl p` for declarations, etc.  `ghc-source-gen` defines type
  synonyms for them:

  ```haskell
  type HsExpr' = HsExpr GhcPs
  type HsDecl' = HsDecl GhcPs
  type HsType' = HsType GhcPs
  -- etc.
  ```

  Furthermore, most constructors take an extra "extension" field which can
  contain different information in different stages, influenced by the parameter
  `p`.  In almost all cases, after the parsing step that field is the
  trivial type `data NoExt = NoExt`.  (For more details, see the [Trees that
  Grow] paper. GHC versions earlier than 8.4 used a similar `PlaceHolder` type.).
  This extra data makes code generation more verbose.

  `ghc-source-gen` automatically sets the `NoExt` value (or equivalent) for the
  terms that it generates, hiding that detail from its external API.  It also
  sets and hides other fields that are irrelevant to parsing or pretty-printing,
  such as simplifier ticks.

  ### Source Locations
  GHC carefully tracks the source location of (nearly) every node in the AST.
  That information is very useful for error reporting.  However, it would be too
  verbose to set it explicitly for each individual node during code generation.
  Furthermore, GHC doesn't use the source location when pretty-printing its
  output, which is `ghc-source-gen`'s main use case.

  Currently, `ghc-source-gen` gives to each node it generates a trivial location
  without an explicit line or column.

  ### Parentheses
  GHC represents parentheses explicitly in its syntax tree, so that it can print code
  exactly as it was parsed.  Unfortunately, this means that its pretty-printing code
  expects those parentheses to be present, and outputs incorrect
  source code if they are missing.  `ghc-source-gen`
  adds parentheses automatically in the code that it generates.

  For example, consider a simplified expression syntax:

  ```haskell
  data Expr
      = VarE String      -- ^ Variables
      | App Expr Expr    -- ^ Function application
      | Paren Expr Expr  -- ^ Parentheses
  ```

  Then GHC would pretty-print as `"f (g x)"` the tree

  ```haskell
  App (VarE "f") $ Paren $ App (VarE "g") (VarE "h")
  ```

  But without the explicit parenthesis, it would pretty-print as `"f g x"`:

  ```haskell
  App (VarE "f") $ App (VarE "g") (VarE "h")
  ```

  which misrepresents the precedence between the two function applications.

  `ghc-source-gen` resolves this issue by inserting parentheses automatically, and only when necessary.  In the expression

  ```haskell
  var "f" @@ (var "g" @@ var "h")
  ```

  it inserts a parenthesis automatically so that the result pretty-prints to `"f (g x)"` as expected.

  GHC uses a similar approach internally itself.  For more discussion, see tickets [14289](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/14289) and [15738](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/15738).
