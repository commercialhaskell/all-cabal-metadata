  'ghcopts' is a library that makes it easy to determine what
  GHC options are needed to compile a file. It was built
  by extracting the relevant code from 'hdevtools' which
  queries 'cabal' and 'stack' to determine the locations
  of various package databases, in order to pass them to
  GHC to process a target file. We have refactored this
  code into a separate package so that it can be used by
  other tools built on the GHC API.
