  ghc-justdoit: a GHC plugin to write the code for you
  =========================================

  This is a prototype of a code synthesis plugin for GHC, which uses LJT proof
  search to instantiate a type.

  Synopsis
  --------

      {-# OPTIONS_GHC -fplugin=GHC.JustDoIt.Plugin #-}
      module Test where

      import GHC.JustDoIt

      foo :: ((a -> r) -> r) -> (a -> ((b -> r) -> r)) -> ((b -> r) -> r)
      foo = (…)

  Missing bits
  ------------

   * The LJT might not be complete, due to insufficient backtracking.
   * The implementation is very much unoptimized.
   * It returns one solution, but not necessary the “best” one. But what is the “best” one?
   * It ignores any recursive type, so it cannot do anything with lists. It would be much more useful if it could do some best-effort thing here as well.
   * It ignores linear types, and will likely produce ill-typed expressions for them.

  If someone wants to pick it up from here, that’d be great!
