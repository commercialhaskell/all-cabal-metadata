description: |-
  @ghc-dump@ is a library, GHC plugin, and set of tools for recording and
  analysing GHC's Core representation. The plugin is compatible with GHC 7.10
  through 8.3, exporting a consistent (albeit somewhat lossy) representation
  across these versions. The AST is encoded as CBOR, which is small and easy to
  deserialise.
  .
  This package provides the AST and compiler plugin. See the @ghc-dump-util@
  package for a useful command-line tool for working with dumps produced by this
  plugin.
  .
  = Usage
  .
  "GhcDump.Plugin" provides a Core-to-Core plugin which dumps a representation
  of the Core AST to a file after every Core-to-Core pass. To use it, simply
  install this package and add @-fplugin GhcDump.Plugin@ to your GHC
  command-line. See the [README](https://github.com/bgamari/ghc-dump)
  for further analysis tips.
