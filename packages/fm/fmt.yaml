synopsis: A new formatting library
changelog: |
  # 0.6.1.2

  * Bumped the `hspec` upper bound.
  * Fixed doctests.

  # 0.6.1.1

  * Added `HasCallStack` to partial functions.

  # 0.6.1

  * Added `instance FromBuilder ByteString` (for both lazy and strict
    bytestrings) and `instance FromBuilder BS.Builder`. These instances
    generate UTF8-encoded bytestrings. This allows producing formatting
    strings for various HTTP libraries that are intent on using `ByteString`
    for text.

  * Added `pretty :: (Buildable a, FromBuilder b) => a -> b` for formatting
    anything as `Buildable`. There's also `prettyLn` for consistency with
    `fmt` and `fmtLn`.

  # 0.6

  * Switched to `Buildable` from `formatting` (since `text-format` is
    unmaintained).

  * Removed the `double-conversion` dependency (which was sometimes causing
    compilation issues). As the result, `exptF`, `fixedF` and `floatF` have
    become slower.

  * The `precF` formatter was removed completely because its semantics was too
    confusing. You can use `Numeric.showGFloat` to achieve a similar effect.

  * `floatF` now always prints a point, even if the number is integral.

  * `tupleLikeF` has been removed. `TupleF` now has an additional instance
    that lets `tupleF` be used to format lists.

  * The `base16-bytestring` dependency was removed.

  * Compatibility with GHC 7.6 and 7.8 was dropped.

  # 0.5.0.0

  * From this version on, `blockListF` never puts blank lines between items.
    If you want blank lines between items, I'm afraid that you'll have to add
    them manually (by e.g. adding a blank line to each item).

  * Now `blockListF'` can be used to create lists with custom bullets.

  * Added `unwordsF` and `unlinesF`.

  * Added the `F` suffix to `indent` and `indent'`.

  # 0.4.0.0

  * Renamed `#|` and `|#` to `+|` and `|+` because HLint can't handle `#|` and
    everyone uses HLint apparently.

  # 0.3.0.0

  * Added time formatters (see `Fmt.Time`).

  # 0.2.0.0

  * Changed `format` and `formatLn` to be polyvariadic.

  # 0.1.0.0

  * Added `genericF` for formatting arbitrary data.

  * Changed `%<` and `>%` to `#|` and `|#` because they turn out to be easier
    to type.

  * Added a migration guide from `formatting`.

  * Changed output of `eitherF`.

  * Added bechmarks.

  # 0.0.0.4

  * Added `format` from `text-format`, because in some cases it's nicer than
    brackets.

  * Renamed `padCenterF` to `padBothF`.

  * Modified `indent` and `indent'` to always add newlines.

  # 0.0.0.3

  * Wrote documentation.

  * Added some formatters:

      * `indent`
      * formatters for lists, maps and tuples (`listF`, etc)
      * `octF`, `binF`, `baseF` and floating-point formatters
      * `hexF` which works on both numbers and bytestrings
      * `ordinalF` and `commaizeF`
      * padding and trimming formatters
      * `base64F` and `base64UrlF`
      * conditionals (`whenF` and `unlessF`)

  * Merged `Fmt.IO` with `Fmt` because orphan instances are controversial.

  * Exported internal classes and functions from `Fmt.Internal`.

  * Added `fmt` and `fmtLn`.

  * Made all operators associate to the right (`Builder` documentation says
    it's faster than the opposite).

  * Reexported `Buildable` and `Builder`.

  # 0.0.0.2

  * Added `>%%<` so that it'd be possible to write `%<a>%%<b>%` instead of
    weird `%<a%<b>%`.

  * Added `%<< ... >>%`, which work work `Show` instead of `Buildable`. If you
    don't care about speed and just want to output something, use them.

  * Added an `IO ()` instance in `Fmt.IO`. If you import that module, raw
    formatted strings would print themselves.

  * Added tests.

  * Changed fixities of operators so that `%<n+1>%` would work.

  * Changed license to BSD3 since all our dependencies are BSD3 and we can't
    use MIT.

  # 0.0.0.1

  First (completely experimental) release.

description: |-
  A new formatting library that tries to be simple to understand while still
  being powerful and providing more convenience features than other libraries
  (like functions for pretty-printing maps and lists, or a function for
  printing arbitrary datatypes using generics).

  A comparison with other libraries:

  * @printf@ (from @Text.Printf@) takes a formatting string and uses some
  type tricks to accept the rest of the arguments polyvariadically. It's
  very concise, but there are some drawbacks – it can't produce @Text@
  (you'd have to @T.pack@ it every time) and it doesn't warn you at
  compile-time if you pass wrong arguments or not enough of them.

  * <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-format text-format> takes a
  formatting string with curly braces denoting places where arguments
  would be substituted (the arguments themselves are provided via a
  tuple). If you want to apply formatting to some of the arguments, you
  have to use one of the provided formatters. Like @printf@, it can fail at
  runtime, but at least the formatters are first-class (and you can add new
  ones).

  * <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/formatting formatting> takes a
  formatting template consisting of pieces of strings interleaved with
  formatters; this ensures that arguments always match their placeholders.
  @formatting@ provides lots of formatters and generally seems to be the
  most popular formatting library here. Unfortunately, at least in my
  experience writing new formatters can be awkward and people sometimes
  have troubles understanding how @formatting@ works.

  * <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fmt fmt> (i.e. this library)
  provides formatters that are ordinary functions, and a bunch of operators
  for concatenating formatted strings; those operators also do automatic
  conversion. There are some convenience formatters which aren't present in
  @formatting@ (like ones for formatting maps, lists, converting to base64,
  etc). Some find the operator syntax annoying, while others like it.
