synopsis: A new formatting library
changelog: ! "# 0.6\n\n* Switched to `Buildable` from `formatting` (since `text-format`
  is\n  unmaintained).\n\n* Removed the `double-conversion` dependency (which was
  sometimes causing\n  compilation issues). As the result, `exptF`, `fixedF` and `floatF`
  have\n  become slower.\n\n* The `precF` formatter was removed completely because
  its semantics was too\n  confusing. You can use `Numeric.showGFloat` to achieve
  a similar effect.\n\n* `floatF` now always prints a point, even if the number is
  integral.\n\n* `tupleLikeF` has been removed. `TupleF` now has an additional instance\n
  \ that lets `tupleF` be used to format lists.\n\n* The `base16-bytestring` dependency
  was removed.\n\n* Compatibility with GHC 7.6 and 7.8 was dropped.\n\n# 0.5.0.0\n\n*
  From this version on, `blockListF` never puts blank lines between items.\n  If you
  want blank lines between items, I'm afraid that you'll have to add\n  them manually
  (by e.g. adding a blank line to each item).\n\n* Now `blockListF'` can be used to
  create lists with custom bullets.\n\n* Added `unwordsF` and `unlinesF`.\n\n* Added
  the `F` suffix to `indent` and `indent'`.\n\n# 0.4.0.0\n\n* Renamed `#|` and `|#`
  to `+|` and `|+` because HLint can't handle `#|` and\n  everyone uses HLint apparently.\n\n#
  0.3.0.0\n\n* Added time formatters (see `Fmt.Time`).\n\n# 0.2.0.0\n\n* Changed `format`
  and `formatLn` to be polyvariadic.\n\n# 0.1.0.0\n\n* Added `genericF` for formatting
  arbitrary data.\n\n* Changed `%<` and `>%` to `#|` and `|#` because they turn out
  to be easier\n  to type.\n\n* Added a migration guide from `formatting`.\n\n* Changed
  output of `eitherF`.\n\n* Added bechmarks.\n\n# 0.0.0.4\n\n* Added `format` from
  `text-format`, because in some cases it's nicer than\n  brackets.\n\n* Renamed `padCenterF`
  to `padBothF`.\n\n* Modified `indent` and `indent'` to always add newlines.\n\n#
  0.0.0.3\n\n* Wrote documentation.\n\n* Added some formatters:\n\n    * `indent`\n
  \   * formatters for lists, maps and tuples (`listF`, etc)\n    * `octF`, `binF`,
  `baseF` and floating-point formatters\n    * `hexF` which works on both numbers
  and bytestrings\n    * `ordinalF` and `commaizeF`\n    * padding and trimming formatters\n
  \   * `base64F` and `base64UrlF`\n    * conditionals (`whenF` and `unlessF`)\n\n*
  Merged `Fmt.IO` with `Fmt` because orphan instances are controversial.\n\n* Exported
  internal classes and functions from `Fmt.Internal`.\n\n* Added `fmt` and `fmtLn`.\n\n*
  Made all operators associate to the right (`Builder` documentation says\n  it's
  faster than the opposite).\n\n* Reexported `Buildable` and `Builder`.\n\n# 0.0.0.2\n\n*
  Added `>%%<` so that it'd be possible to write `%<a>%%<b>%` instead of\n  weird
  `%<a%<b>%`.\n\n* Added `%<< ... >>%`, which work work `Show` instead of `Buildable`.
  If you\n  don't care about speed and just want to output something, use them.\n\n*
  Added an `IO ()` instance in `Fmt.IO`. If you import that module, raw\n  formatted
  strings would print themselves.\n\n* Added tests.\n\n* Changed fixities of operators
  so that `%<n+1>%` would work.\n\n* Changed license to BSD3 since all our dependencies
  are BSD3 and we can't\n  use MIT.\n\n# 0.0.0.1\n\nFirst (completely experimental)
  release.\n"

description: ! 'A new formatting library that tries to be simple to understand while
  still

  being powerful and providing more convenience features than other libraries

  (like functions for pretty-printing maps and lists, or a function for

  printing arbitrary datatypes using generics).


  A comparison with other libraries:


  * @printf@ (from @Text.Printf@) takes a formatting string and uses some

  type tricks to accept the rest of the arguments polyvariadically. It''s

  very concise, but there are some drawbacks – it can''t produce @Text@

  (you''d have to @T.pack@ it every time) and it doesn''t warn you at

  compile-time if you pass wrong arguments or not enough of them.


  * <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-format text-format> takes a

  formatting string with curly braces denoting places where arguments

  would be substituted (the arguments themselves are provided via a

  tuple). If you want to apply formatting to some of the arguments, you

  have to use one of the provided formatters. Like @printf@, it can fail at

  runtime, but at least the formatters are first-class (and you can add new

  ones).


  * <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/formatting formatting> takes a

  formatting template consisting of pieces of strings interleaved with

  formatters; this ensures that arguments always match their placeholders.

  @formatting@ provides lots of formatters and generally seems to be the

  most popular formatting library here. Unfortunately, at least in my

  experience writing new formatters can be awkward and people sometimes

  have troubles understanding how @formatting@ works.


  * <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fmt fmt> (i.e. this library)

  provides formatters that are ordinary functions, and a bunch of operators

  for concatenating formatted strings; those operators also do automatic

  conversion. There are some convenience formatters which aren''t present in

  @formatting@ (like ones for formatting maps, lists, converting to base64,

  etc). Some find the operator syntax annoying, while others like it.'
