  # dbus-app-launcher

  A simple service that allows executing a program via D-Bus.

  Note: Allowing D-Bus clients to execute arbitrary programs may pose a security
  risk. Use carefully.

  ## Installation

  To build the code, you will need Haskell and the `stack` command line utility.
  Get it [here](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/).

  To build and install, run `stack install`. This will build the code and copy the
  executable to `~/.local/bin`.

  Next, set up a D-Bus service description that will automatically launch the new
  service whenever it is accessed:

  `/usr/share/dbus-1/services/nl.dvdgiessen.dbusapplauncher.service`

  ```ini
  [D-BUS Service]
  Name=nl.dvdgiessen.dbusapplauncher
  Exec=/home/USERNAME/.local/bin/dbus-app-launcher
  ```

  ## Using the service

  The service currently exports one interface, `Exec`. Calling any of the methods
  of this interface will start the program using the `exec()` syscall.

  - Service name: `nl.dvdgiessen.dbusapplauncher`
  - Object path: `/nl/dvdgiessen/DBusAppLauncher`
  - Interface: `nl.dvdgiessen.dbusapplauncher.Exec`
  - Methods:
    - `Cmd(String cmd)`
    - `CmdArgs(String cmd, List<String> args)`
    - `CmdArgsEnv(String cmd, List<String> args, Map<String,String> env)`

  ## Issues and contributing

  This is my first Haskell program, so there's probably plenty that could be
  improved upon. Feel free to fork it or open pull requests if you find a bug.

  I might add more functionality in the future, for example for running programs
  and returning their exit code and stdout/stderr output. Currently my own use
  case for this program is for starting applications from KWin scripts (see
  [kwin-toggleterminal](https://github.com/DvdGiessen/kwin-toggleterminal) if
  you're interested in that sort of thing), so adding more functionality probably
  won't be a priority until I have a need for it myself.
