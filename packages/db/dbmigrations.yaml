  dbmigrations
  ------------

  This package contains a library for the creation, management, and
  installation of schema updates (called "migrations") for a relational
  database. In particular, this package lets the migration author express
  explicit dependencies between migrations. This library is accompanied
  by a number database-specific packages that contain the management
  tools to automatically install or revert migrations accordingly.

  This package operates on two logical entities:

   - The "backend": the relational database whose schema you want to
     manage.

   - The "migration store": the collection of schema changes you want to
     apply to the database. These migrations are expressed using plain
     text files collected together in a single directory, although the
     library is general enough to permit easy implementation of other
     storage representations for migrations.

  Getting started
  ---------------

  To get started, install the right database-specific dbmigrations package
  for your database. Current options are:

   * `dbmigrations-postgresql`
   * `dbmigrations-mysql`
   * `dbmigrations-sqlite`

  Each package provides a variant of the "moo" management program
  ("moo-postgresql", "moo-mysql", and "moo-sqlite" respectively) to be
  used to manage your database schema. See MOO.TXT for details on how to
  use these tools to manage your database migrations.

  Submitting patches
  ------------------

  I'll gladly consider accepting patches to this package; please do not
  hesitate to submit GitHub pull requests. I'll be more likely to accept
  a patch if you can follow these guidelines where appropriate:

    - Keep patches small; a single patch should make a single logical
      change with minimal scope.

    - If possible, include tests with your patch.

    - If possible, include haddock with your patch.
