  ## 0.12.1.1 -- December 2019

  * Bugfixes:
      - Fix layouting regression of record update for many/large fields
      - Fix whitespace regression on ExplicitForall notation
        (`foo :: forall  a . Show a => a -> a`, note the double space)
        introduced in 0.12. (#264)
      - Fix roundtripping of type equality constraint
        `f :: ((~) a b) => a -> b` (#267)
  * One experimental feature addition: Turning brace notation semicolons into
    newlines when formatting (see #270)

  ## 0.12.1.0 -- September 2019

  * Support ghc-8.8
  * Support for OverloadedLabels extension
    (thanks to Evan Rutledge Borden @eborden)
  * Support for Implicit Params extension (thanks to pepe iborra @pepeiborra)
  * Add flag `--no-user-config` to enable only using manually passed config
  * Disable the performance test suite by default to prevent spurious failures
    on certain CI setups. The github/travis brittany CI still has all tests
    enabled. See the `brittany-test-perf` flag in the cabal file.
  * Bugfixes:
      - Fix one wandering-comment bug for let-in expressions
      - Fix invalid result for prefix operator pattern matches
      - Fix lambda expression with laziness/strictness annotation
      - Fix parenthesis handling for infix pattern matches with 3+ arguments
  * Changes to layouting behaviour:
      - For pattern matching and data/instance definitions, the usage of
        parenthesis is now "normalized", i.e. superfluous parens are removed by
        brittany.

  ## 0.12.0.0 -- June 2019

  * Support for ghc-8.6 (basic support, not necessarily all new syntactic
    extensions)
  * Support -XExplicitNamespaces and -XPatternSynonyms
  * Allow a --dry-run sort of operation via flag "-c/--check-mode"
    (thanks to Doug Beardsley @mightybyte)
  * Include file name in errors about unsupported syntax nodes (thanks to @5outh)
  * Partially implement layouting class instances: Layouts children, but
    falls back on ghc-exactprint for the instance head
    (thanks to Rupert Horlick @ruhatch)
  * Implement layouting for type synonyms (thanks to Rupert Horlick @ruhatch)
  * Support -XMagicHash, -XUnboxedTuples (thanks to Sergey Vinokurov @sergv)
  * Support -XQuasiQuotes (no formatting applied to the splices; they are simply
    retained without causing the dreaded "Unknown construct: HsSpliceE{}")
      - `lconfig_allowHangingQuasiQuotes` controls whether multi-line
        QuasiQuotes are allowed to start at the end of the current line, or
        whether they are always placed in new lines.
  * Bugfixes:
      - Fix rare-case alignment bug with IndentPolicyMultiple (#144)
      - Make inline layout config apply to module header (#151)
      - Fix unaligned import-hiding layout (#150)
      - Fix idempotence violation for comments around if-then-else (#167)
      - Fix comments having an effect on far-away parent node's layout (#159)
      - Fix imports of type operators ("symbolic data types")
        (thanks to Phil Hazelden @ChickenProp)
      - Work around GHC and cabal-install misfeature ".ghc.environment files"
        that could break brittany in unexpected and hard-to-understand ways
      - Stop removing empty lines before `where` keyword in a couple of cases
      - Fix functions with mixing prefix/infix style causing error (#234)
  * Changes to layout:
      - Align usage of spaces for record update vs record construction (#126)
      - More indentation to import-hiding-paragraph (follow-up to #150 fix)
      - Record construction and update now are layouted in the same way
        (thanks to Evan Rutledge Borden @eborden)
      - Stop allowing single-line layout when there are comments between
        arguments (#214) (thanks to @matt-noonan)
  * Various build-instructions and editor integrations

  ## 0.11.0.0 -- May 2018

  * Support for ghc-8.4
  * Implement inline-config
      e.g. "-- brittany --indent=4"

      respects the following comment forms as input:

      ~~~~
      source comment                       affected target
      ======================================================
      "-- brittany CONFIG"                 whole module
      "-- brittany-next-binding CONFIG"    next binding
      "-- brittany-disable-next-binding"   next binding
      "-- brittany @ myExampleFunc CONFIG" `myExampleFunc`
      ~~~~

      multiline-comments are supported too, although
      the specification must still be a single line. E.g.

      > "{- brittany --columns 50 -}"

      CONFIG is either:

      1) one or more flags in the form of what brittany accepts
         on the commandline, e.g. "--columns 50", or
      2) one or more specifications in the form of what brittany
         accepts in its config files for the layouting config
         (a one-line yaml document), e.g. "{ lconfig_cols: 50 }"
  * Implement `IndentPolicyMultiple` (thanks to Bryan Richter @chreekat)
      Restrict indentation amounts to `n * indentAmount`
  * Implement `--obfuscate` that replaces non-keyword identifiers with random
    names
  * Do not write files unless there are changes (don't update modtime)
    (`--write-mode=inplace`) (#93)
  * Bugfixes:
      - Fix empty function constraints (`() => IO ()`) (#133)
      - Fix overflowing columns caused by aligning with surrounding lines
        for certain complex cases
      - Implement hacky workaround for `type instance`s (`-XTypeFamilies`) (#89)
  * Layouting changes:
      - On default settings, allow single-line module header
        `module MyModule where` when no exports
      - Fix one case of non-optimal layouting for if-then-else
      - Allow same-line let binding inside do-notation with
        `IndentPolicyLeft/Multiple` and `indentAmount>=4`

  ## 0.10.0.0 -- March 2018

  * Implement module/exports/imports layouting (thanks to sniperrifle2004)
  * Expose config paths/parsing functions (thanks to Alexey Raga)
  * Bugfixes:
      - Fix layouting of `NOINLINE` pragma
      - Fix ticked type operator (e.g. `':-`) losing tick (#125)
      - Fix alignment issue with cases involving operators (#65)
      - Fix comments in tuples being dropped (#37)
      - Fix comment placements with let-in (#110)
  * Layouting changes:
      - Align arguments only if it is the same function being called (#128)
      - Do not use single-line layout when infix operator expression contains
        comments (#111)
  * New layouting config items:
      - `lconfig_importColumn`/`--import-col`: column for import items
      - `lconfig_importAsColumn`/`--import-as-col`: column for the "as" name of
        a module
      - `lconfig_reformatModulePreamble`: controls module/export/import layouting
        (default True)
      - `lconfig_allowSingleLineExportList`: permit one-line module header, e.g.
        `module Main (main)` (default False)

  ## 0.9.0.1  -- February 2018

  * Support `TupleSections` (thanks to Matthew Piziak)
  * Bugfixes:
      - Fix Shebang handling with stdin input (#92)
      - Fix bug that effectively deleted strict/lazy matches (BangPatterns) (#116)
      - Fix infix operator whitespace bug (#101, #114)
      - Fix help command output and its layouting (#103)
      - Fix crash when config dir does not exist yet (#115)
  * Layouting changes:
      - no space after opening non-tuple parenthesis even for multi-line case
      - use spaces around infix operators (applies to sections and in pattern
        matches)
      - Let-in is layouted more flexibly in fewer lines, if possible
        (thanks to Evan Borden)

  ## 0.9.0.0  -- December 2017

  * Change default global config path (use XDG spec)
      Existing config should still be respected, so this should not break
      compatibility
  * Support per-project config
  * ! Slight rework of the commandline interface:
      - Support multiple inputs and outputs
      - Support inplace-transformation for multiple files via
        `--write-mode=inplace`
  * Implement `IndentPolicyLeft` - the indentation mode that never adds more
    than the base indentation for nested parts (no hanging indentation)

      (thanks to Evan Borden)
  * Fix bug that manifested in bad output for (top-level) template haskell splices
  * Extension support:
      - RecordWildCards
      - RecursiveDo (was only partially supported previously)
  * Layouting Bugfixes:
      - Properly reproduce parentheses around kind signatures
      - Fix issue around promoted lists
        (example good: `'[ 'True]` bad: `'['True]`)
      - Trim text from exactprint used as workaround for unknown nodes
        (unsupported extension workaround)
  * Layouting changes
      - Insert spaces around operator in sections

  ## 0.8.0.3  -- September 2017

  * Support for ghc-8.2.1
  * Bugfixes:
      - Fix quadratic performance issue
      - Fix special "where" indentation with indentAmount /= 2
      - Fix negative literals in patterns
      - Support type applications
  * Accept `-h` for `--help` and improve help layouting (via butcher-1.1.0.2)
  * Add continuous integration via travis (cabal, cabal-new, stack)
    (brittle due compilation time limit)
  * Reduce compilation memory usage a bit

  ## 0.8.0.2  -- August 2017

  * Add library interface, to be used by `haskell-ide-engine`.
  * Publish to hackage.

  ## 0.8.0.1  -- May 2017

  * Document the high-level design of the program
  * Improve layouting for many different cases, too many to list here. Brittany
    still does only reformat top-level type signatures and bindings.
  * Publish all dependencies on hackage; `ghc-exactprint ` adaptions got merged
    upstream as well.
  * Reduce the aggressiveness of horizontal alignment; this is configurable
    via the `lconfig_alignmentLimit` and `lconfig_alignmentBreakOnMultiline`
    values (config file only for now).
  * (!) Breaking change to the config file format: The keys previously contained
    underscore (e.g. `_econf_Werror`) but do not anymore (`econf_Werror`).
    Add config version; also
  * Move config value `conf_errorHandling.econf_CPPMode` to
    `conf_preprocessor.ppconf_CPPMode`.
  * Cope with unhandled syntactical constructs more gracefully by falling back
    on the ghc-exactprint output; Brittany simply won't touch certain
    subexpressions instead of aborting. This is further configurable via the
    `econf_omit_output_valid_check` config value.
  * Due to improvements to the `butcher` library: Accept `--key=value` on
    commandline (only `--key value` was supported previously).
  * Improve testsuite setup: The `tests.blt` file contains many different
    testcases that allow quick addition - feel free to report bugs directly
    by making PRs with additions to that file.
  * Release under the terms of the AGPLv3

  ## 0.7.1.0  -- 2016-09-06

  * Support stack
  * Fix --ghc-options handling
  * Add commandline param to allow shortcut `brittany Foo.hs`
    meaning `brittany -i Foo.hs`

  ## 0.7.0.0  -- 2016-09-04

  * First official alpha release
  * Fix commandline flag parsing
  * Implement/Improve horizontal aligning
  * Various minor fixes and layouting improvements

  ## 0.6.0.0  -- 2016-08-12

  * Add check that output is syntactically valid
  * (!) Change config format, breaking previous configs
  * Various layouting additions/imporements
  * Various minor fixes

  ## 0.5.0.0  -- 2016-08-08

  * Support --ghc-options
  * Support user and local config files: Local config file is not mandatory
    anymore.

  ## 0.4.0.0  -- 2016-08-06

  * Make comment handling a bit more clever
  * Various layouting additions/imporements

  ## 0.3.0.0  -- 2016-08-04

  * Various layouting additions/imporements

  ## 0.2.0.0  -- 2016-07-30

  * Basic and partial implementation for
    expression/decl/statement/pattern layouting
  * Prevent exponential behaviour using manual stablenames

  ## 0.1.0.0  -- 2016-06-05

  * First working code for type signature layouting

  # brittany [![Hackage version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/brittany.svg?label=Hackage)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/brittany) [![Stackage version](https://www.stackage.org/package/brittany/badge/lts?label=Stackage)](https://www.stackage.org/package/brittany) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/lspitzner/brittany.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/lspitzner/brittany)
  haskell source code formatter

  ![Output sample](https://github.com/lspitzner/brittany/raw/master/brittany-sample.gif)

  (see [more examples and comparisons](/doc/showcases))

  This project's goals roughly are to:

  - Always retain the semantics of the source being transformed;
  - Be idempotent;
  - Support the full GHC-haskell syntax including syntactic extensions
    (but excluding `-XCPP` which is too hard);
  - Retain newlines and comments unmodified;
  - Be clever about using the available horizontal space while not overflowing
    the column maximum unless it cannot be avoided;
  - Be clever about aligning things horizontally (this can be turned off
    completely however);
  - Have linear complexity in the size of the input.

  In theory, the core algorithm inside brittany reaches these goals. It is rather
  clever about making use of horizontal space while still being linear in the
  size of the input (although the constant factor is not small). See
  [these examples of clever layouting](/doc/showcases/Layout_Interactions.md).

  But brittany is not finished yet, and there are some open issues that yet
  require fixing:

  - **only the module header (imports/exports), type-signatures and
    function/value bindings** are processed;
    other module elements (data-decls, classes, instances, etc.)
    are not transformed in any way; this extends to e.g. **bindings inside class
    instance definitions** - they **won't be touched** (yet).
  - By using `ghc-exactprint` as the parser, brittany supports full GHC
    including extensions, but **some of the less common syntactic elements
    (even of 2010 haskell) are not handled**.
  - **There are some known issues regarding handling of in-source comments.**
    There are cases where comments are not copied to the output (this will
    be detected and the user will get an error); there are other cases where
    comments are moved slightly; there are also cases where comments result in
    wonky newline insertion (although this should be a purely aesthetic issue.)

  ## Try without Installing

  You can [paste haskell code over here](https://hexagoxel.de/brittany/)
  to test how it gets formatted by brittany. (Rg. privacy: the server does
  log the size of the input, but _not_ the full input/output of requests.)

  # Other usage notes

  - Supports GHC versions `8.6`, `8.8`, `8.10`.
  - included in stackage with lts>=10.0 (or nightlies dating to >=2017-11-15)
  - config (file) documentation is lacking.
  - some config values can not be configured via commandline yet.
  - uses/creates user config file in `~/.config/brittany/config.yaml`;
    also reads (the first) `brittany.yaml` found in current or parent
    directories.

  # Installation

  - via `stack`

      ~~~~.sh
      stack install brittany # --resolver lts-10.0
      ~~~~

      If you use an lts that includes brittany this should just work; otherwise
      you may want to clone the repo and try again (there are several stack.yamls
      included).

  - via `nix`:
      ~~~.sh
      nix build
      nix-env -i ./result
      ~~~

  - via `cabal`

      Due to constant changes to the cabal UI, I have given up on making sure
      these instructions work before releases. Please do not expect these
      instructions to be up-to-date; they may produce incomprehensible error
      messages, they may be broken otherwise, they may work now but break with
      the next cabal release. Thanks for your understanding, and feel free to
      open issues for any problems you encounter. -- lennart

      If you are using cabal-3.0, using
      `cabal install brittany --installdir=$HOME/.cabal/bin`
      might work. Keep in mind that cabal merely puts a symlink to the "store"
      into the installdir, so you have to re-install if you ever clean your
      store. On cabal-2.4, try `cabal v2-install brittany`. On cabal-2.2 or
      earlier you might be succesful using
      ```cabal new-build exe:brittany; cp `find dist-newstyle/ -name brittany -type f | xargs -x ls -t | head -n1` $HOME/.cabal/bin/```.
      Alternatively, you can also use the v1-approach with sandboxes as
      `cabal v1-sandbox init; cabal v1-install brittany --bindir=$HOME/.cabal/bin`.

      (TODO: These instructions are more confusing than helpful. I am inclined
      to just remove them.)

  - on ArchLinux:
      ~~~~.sh
      pacman -S haskell-brittany
      ~~~~

  # Development tips

  ## Run a hoogle server

  To host a local Hoogle server with all of Brittany's dependencies run:

  ```sh
  echo brittany.cabal |
    $(nix-build '<nixpkgs>' --no-link -A entr)/bin/entr -r -- \
      sh -c "nix-shell --run 'hoogle server --local'"
  ```

  This will watch `brittany.cabal` for changes and restart the server when new dependencies are added there.

  # Editor Integration

  #### Sublime text
    [In this gist](https://gist.github.com/lspitzner/097c33177248a65e7657f0c6d0d12075)
    I have described a haskell setup that includes a shortcut to run brittany formatting.
  #### VSCode
    [This extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MaxGabriel.brittany)
    connects commandline `brittany` to VSCode formatting API. Thanks to @MaxGabriel.
  #### Via HIE
    [haskell-ide-engine](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine)
    includes a `brittany` plugin that directly uses the brittany library.
    Relevant for any editors that properly support the language-server-protocol.
  #### Neovim / Vim 8
    The [Neoformat](https://github.com/sbdchd/neoformat) plugin comes with support for
    brittany built in.
  #### Atom
    [Atom Beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify) supports brittany as a formatter for Haskell. Since the default formatter is set to hindent, you will need to change this setting to brittany, after installing the extension.
  #### Emacs
    [format-all](https://github.com/lassik/emacs-format-all-the-code) support brittany as the default formatter for Haskell.

  # Usage

  - Default mode of operation: Transform a single module, from `stdin` to `stdout`.
    Can pass one or multiple files as input, and there is a flag to override them
    in place instead of using `stdout` (since 0.9.0.0). So:

      ~~~~ .sh
      brittany                           # stdin -> stdout
      brittany mysource.hs               # ./mysource.hs -> stdout
      brittany --write-mode=inplace *.hs # apply formatting to all ./*.hs inplace
      ~~~~

  - For stdin/stdout usage it makes sense to enable certain syntactic extensions
    by default, i.e. to add something like this to your
    `~/.config/brittany/config.yaml` (execute `brittany` once to create default):

      ~~~~

  # Feature Requests, Contribution, Documentation

  For a long time this project has had a single maintainer, and as a consequence
  there have been some mildly large delays for reacting to feature requests
  and even PRs.

  Sorry about that.

  The good news is that this project is getting sponsored by PRODA LTD, and two
  previous contributors, Evan Borden and Taylor Fausak, have agreed on helping
  with organisational aspects. Thanks!

  Still, this project has a long queue of very sensible feature requests, so it
  may take some time until new ones get our attention. But with the help of
  the co-maintainers, at least the reaction-times on PRs and the frequency
  of releases should improve significantly.

  If you are interested in making your own contributions, there is
  a good amount of high-level documentation at

  [the documentation index](doc/implementation/index.md)
