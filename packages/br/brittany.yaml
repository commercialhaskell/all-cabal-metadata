changelog: ! "# Revision history for brittany\n\n## 0.9.0.1  -- February 2018\n\n*
  Support `TupleSections` (thanks to Matthew Piziak)\n* Bugfixes:\n    - Fix Shebang
  handling with stdin input (#92)\n    - Fix bug that effectively deleted strict/lazy
  matches (BangPatterns) (#116)\n    - Fix infix operator whitespace bug (#101, #114)\n
  \   - Fix help command output and its layouting (#103)\n    - Fix crash when config
  dir does not exist yet (#115)\n* Layouting changes:\n    - no space after opening
  non-tuple parenthesis even for multi-line case\n    - use spaces around infix operators
  (applies to sections and in pattern\n      matches)\n    - Let-in is layouted more
  flexibly in fewer lines, if possible\n      (thanks to Evan Borden)\n\n## 0.9.0.0
  \ -- December 2017\n\n* Change default global config path (use XDG spec)\n    Existing
  config should still be respected, so this should not break\n    compatibility\n*
  Support per-project config\n* ! Slight rework of the commandline interface:\n    -
  Support multiple inputs and outputs\n    - Support inplace-transformation for multiple
  files via\n      `--write-mode=inplace`\n* Implement `IndentPolicyLeft` - the indentation
  mode that never adds more\n  than the base indentation for nested parts (no hanging
  indentation)\n\n    (thanks to Evan Borden)\n* Fix bug that manifested in bad output
  for (top-level) template haskell splices\n* Extension support:\n    - RecordWildCards\n
  \   - RecursiveDo (was only partially supported previously)\n* Layouting Bugfixes:\n
  \   - Properly reproduce parentheses around kind signatures\n    - Fix issue around
  promoted lists\n      (example good: `'[ 'True]` bad: `'['True]`)\n    - Trim text
  from exactprint used as workaround for unknown nodes\n      (unsupported extension
  workaround)\n* Layouting changes\n    - Insert spaces around operator in sections\n\n##
  0.8.0.3  -- September 2017\n\n* Support for ghc-8.2.1\n* Bugfixes:\n    - Fix quadratic
  performance issue\n    - Fix special \"where\" indentation with indentAmount /=
  2\n    - Fix negative literals in patterns\n    - Support type applications\n* Accept
  `-h` for `--help` and improve help layouting (via butcher-1.1.0.2)\n* Add continuous
  integration via travis (cabal, cabal-new, stack)\n  (brittle due compilation time
  limit)\n* Reduce compilation memory usage a bit\n\n## 0.8.0.2  -- August 2017\n\n*
  Add library interface, to be used by `haskell-ide-engine`.\n* Publish to hackage.\n\n##
  0.8.0.1  -- May 2017\n\n* Document the high-level design of the program\n* Improve
  layouting for many different cases, too many to list here. Brittany\n  still does
  only reformat top-level type signatures and bindings.\n* Publish all dependencies
  on hackage; `ghc-exactprint ` adaptions got merged\n  upstream as well.\n* Reduce
  the aggressiveness of horizontal alignment; this is configurable\n  via the `lconfig_alignmentLimit`
  and `lconfig_alignmentBreakOnMultiline`\n  values (config file only for now).\n*
  (!) Breaking change to the config file format: The keys previously contained\n  underscore
  (e.g. `_econf_Werror`) but do not anymore (`econf_Werror`).\n  Add config version;
  also\n* Move config value `conf_errorHandling.econf_CPPMode` to\n  `conf_preprocessor.ppconf_CPPMode`.\n*
  Cope with unhandled syntactical constructs more gracefully by falling back\n  on
  the ghc-exactprint output; Brittany simply won't touch certain\n  subexpressions
  instead of aborting. This is further configurable via the\n  `econf_omit_output_valid_check`
  config value.\n* Due to improvements to the `butcher` library: Accept `--key=value`
  on\n  commandline (only `--key value` was supported previously).\n* Improve testsuite
  setup: The `tests.blt` file contains many different\n  testcases that allow quick
  addition - feel free to report bugs directly\n  by making PRs with additions to
  that file.\n* Release under the terms of the AGPLv3\n\n## 0.7.1.0  -- 2016-09-06\n\n*
  Support stack\n* Fix --ghc-options handling\n* Add commandline param to allow shortcut
  `brittany Foo.hs`\n  meaning `brittany -i Foo.hs`\n\n## 0.7.0.0  -- 2016-09-04\n\n*
  First official alpha release\n* Fix commandline flag parsing\n* Implement/Improve
  horizontal aligning\n* Various minor fixes and layouting improvements\n\n## 0.6.0.0
  \ -- 2016-08-12\n\n* Add check that output is syntactically valid\n* (!) Change
  config format, breaking previous configs\n* Various layouting additions/imporements\n*
  Various minor fixes\n\n## 0.5.0.0  -- 2016-08-08\n\n* Support --ghc-options\n* Support
  user and local config files: Local config file is not mandatory\n  anymore.\n\n##
  0.4.0.0  -- 2016-08-06\n\n* Make comment handling a bit more clever\n* Various layouting
  additions/imporements\n\n## 0.3.0.0  -- 2016-08-04\n\n* Various layouting additions/imporements\n\n##
  0.2.0.0  -- 2016-07-30\n\n* Basic and partial implementation for\n  expression/decl/statement/pattern
  layouting\n* Prevent exponential behaviour using manual stablenames\n\n## 0.1.0.0
  \ -- 2016-06-05\n\n* First working code for type signature layouting\n"

description: ! "# brittany [![Hackage version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/brittany.svg?label=Hackage)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/brittany)
  [![Stackage version](https://www.stackage.org/package/brittany/badge/lts?label=Stackage)](https://www.stackage.org/package/brittany)
  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/lspitzner/brittany.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/lspitzner/brittany)
  \nhaskell source code formatter\n\n![Output sample](https://github.com/lspitzner/brittany/raw/master/brittany-sample.gif)\n\n(see
  [more examples and comparisons](/doc/showcases))\n\nThis project's goals roughly
  are to:\n\n- Always retain the semantics of the source being transformed;\n- Be
  idempotent (this also directly ensures that only valid haskell is\n  produced);\n-
  Support the full GHC-haskell syntax including syntactic extensions\n  (but excluding
  `-XCPP` which is too hard);\n- Retain newlines and comments unmodified;\n- Be clever
  about using the available horizontal space while not overflowing\n  it if it cannot
  be avoided;\n- Be clever about aligning things horizontally (this can be turned
  off\n  completely however);\n- Have linear complexity in the size of the input.\n\nIn
  theory, the core algorithm inside brittany reaches these goals. It is rather\nclever
  about making use of horizontal space while still being linear in the\nsize of the
  input (although the constant factor is not small). See\n[these examples of clever
  layouting](/doc/showcases/Layout_Interactions.md).\n\nBut brittany is not finished
  yet, and there are some open issues that yet\nrequire fixing:\n\n- **only type-signatures
  and function/value bindings** are processed;\n  other module elements (data-decls,
  classes, instances, imports/exports etc.)\n  are not transformed in any way; this
  extends to e.g. **bindings inside class\n  instance definitions** - they **won't
  be touched** (yet).\n- By using `ghc-exactprint` as the parser, brittany supports
  full GHC \n  including extensions, but **some of the less common syntactic elements\n
  \ (even of 2010 haskell) are not handled**.\n- **There are some known issues regarding
  handling of in-source comments.**\n  There are cases where comments are not copied
  to the output (this will\n  be detected and the user will get an error); there are
  other cases where\n  comments are moved slightly; there are also cases where comments
  result in\n  wonky newline insertion (although this should be a purely aesthetic
  issue.)\n- ~~There is an **open performance issue on large inputs** (due to an\n
  \ accidentally quadratic sub-algorithm); noticable for inputs with >1k loc.~~\n
  \ (fixed in `0.8.0.3`)\n\n## Try without Installing\n\nYou can [paste haskell code
  over here](https://hexagoxel.de/brittany/)\nto test how it gets formatted by brittany.
  (Rg. privacy: the server does\nlog the size of the input, but _not_ the full requests.)\n\n#
  Other usage notes\n\n- Supports GHC versions `8.0.*` and `8.2.*`.\n- included in
  stackage with lts>=10.0 (or nightlies dating to >=2017-11-15)\n- config (file) documentation
  is lacking.\n- some config values can not be configured via commandline yet.\n-
  uses/creates user config file in `~/.config/brittany/config.yaml`;\n  also reads
  (the first) `brittany.yaml` found in current or parent\n  directories.\n\n# Installation\n\n-
  via `cabal` \"old-build\"\n\n    ~~~~.sh\n    # optionally:\n    # mkdir brittany\n
  \   # cd brittany\n    # cabal sandbox init\n    cabal install brittany --bindir=$HOME/.cabal/bin
  # -w $PATH_TO_GHC_8_0\n    ~~~~\n\n- via `cabal new-build`\n\n    ~~~~.sh\n    cabal
  unpack brittany\n    cd brittany-0.8.0.2\n    # cabal new-configure -w $PATH_TO_GHC_8_0\n
  \   cabal new-build exe:brittany\n    # and it should be safe to just copy the executable,
  e.g.\n    cp `./find dist-newstyle/build/ -type f -name brittany` $HOME/.cabal/bin/\n
  \   ~~~~\n\n- via `stack` using a sufficiently recent stackage snapshot (dated to
  >= 2017-11-15)\n\n    ~~~~.sh\n    stack install brittany # --resolver lts-10.0\n
  \   ~~~~\n\n    (earlier ltss did not include `brittany` yet, but the repo should
  contain a\n    `stack.yaml` that works with ghc-8.0.)\n\n- on ArchLinux via [the
  britanny AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/brittany/)\n  using `aura`:\n
  \   ~~~~.sh\n    aura -A brittany\n    ~~~~\n\n# Editor Integration\n\n#### Sublime
  text\n  [In this gist](https://gist.github.com/lspitzner/097c33177248a65e7657f0c6d0d12075)\n
  \ I have described a haskell setup that includes a shortcut to run brittany formatting.\n####
  VSCode\n  [This extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MaxGabriel.brittany)\n
  \ connects commandline `brittany` to VSCode formatting API. Thanks to @MaxGarbriel.\n####
  Via HIE\n  [haskell-ide-engine](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine)\n
  \ includes a `brittany` plugin that directly uses the brittany library.\n  Relevant
  for any editors that properly support the language-server-protocol.\n#### Neovim
  / Vim 8\n  The [Neoformat](https://github.com/sbdchd/neoformat) plugin comes with
  support for\n  brittany built in.\n\n# Usage\n\n- Default mode of operation: Transform
  a single module, from `stdin` to `stdout`.\n  Can pass one or multiple files as
  input, and there is a flag to override them\n  in place instead of using `stdout`
  (since 0.9.0.0). So:\n  \n    ~~~~ .sh\n    brittany                           #
  stdin -> stdout\n    brittany mysource.hs               # ./mysource.hs -> stdout\n
  \   brittany --write-mode=inplace *.hs # apply formatting to all ./*.hs inplace\n
  \   ~~~~\n    \n- For stdin/stdout usage it makes sense to enable certain syntactic
  extensions\n  by default, i.e. to add something like this to your\n  `~/.config/brittany/config.yaml`
  (execute `brittany` once to create default):\n\n    ~~~~\n    conf_forward:\n      options_ghc:\n
  \     - -XLambdaCase\n      - -XMultiWayIf\n      - -XGADTs\n      - -XPatternGuards\n
  \     - -XViewPatterns\n      - -XRecursiveDo\n      - -XTupleSections\n      -
  -XExplicitForAll\n      - -XImplicitParams\n      - -XQuasiQuotes\n      - -XTemplateHaskell\n
  \     - -XBangPatterns\n    ~~~~\n\n# Feature Requests, Contribution, Documentation\n\nThis
  currently is a one-person project in the sense that 90% of the code is\nwritten
  by one person. And (unfortunately) it is not my job to keep improving\nthis project.
  Please forgive that as a consequence my time to invest on new\nfeatures is rather
  limited.\n\nNonetheless I consider it \"in active development\" :)\n\nOne way of
  speeding things up is to make your own contributions. There is\na good amount of
  high-level documentation at\n\n[the documentation index](doc/implementation/index.md)\n\nNote
  that most development happens on the `dev` branch of this repository!\n\n# License\n\nCopyright
