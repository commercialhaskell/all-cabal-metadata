  # Breakpoint

  The ability to set breakpoints in a program can provide valuable insights when
  debugging. While GHCi has built-in support for setting breakpoints, it is not
  actively maintained and suffers from several critical limitations:
  - It's prohibitively buggy when used with concurrent programs, such as web servers.
  - Breakpoints can only be set in interpreted code.
  - Occasionally it simply doesn't work at all.

  The `breakpoint` library solves these problems by implementing breakpoints as
  a GHC plugin.

  ### Usage

  Add `breakpoint` as a dependency to your project then enable breakpoints in a
  module by adding `{-# OPTIONS_GHC -fplugin Debug.Breakpoint #-}` to the top of
  the file and importing the `Debug.Breakpoint` module. You can then use the
  `breakpoint`, `breakpointIO`, or `breakpointM` functions as appropriate to set
  a breakpoint.

  - `breakpoint :: a -> a` is for use in pure code. Apart from the side-effect of
    setting a breakpoint, it is the identity function. The value passed to `breakpoint`
    will appear as a variable called `*result` in the output.
  - `breakpointIO :: MonadIO m => m ()` is for monadic code that can perform IO.
  - `breakpointM :: Applicative f => f ()` is for arbitrary `Applicative`
    contexts.

  `breakpoint` and `breakpointM` both use `unsafePerformIO` which means they are
  at the mercy of the simplifier and all the other pitfalls of lazy IO. For this
  reason, it's generally preferable to use `breakpointIO` in contexts that
  support it.

  Here's an example module:
  ```haskell
  {-# OPTIONS_GHC -fplugin Debug.Breakpoint #-}

  import Debug.Breakpoint

  main :: IO ()
  main = do
    x <- getLine
    let y = 2 :: Int
        z = id :: Bool -> Bool
    breakpointIO
    pure ()
  ```

  When the breakpoint expression gets evaluated, you will see terminal output such
  as
  ```
  ### Breakpoint Hit ###
  (app/Main.hs:24:3-6)
  x =
    "input"

  y =
    2

  z =
    <Bool -> Bool>

  Press enter to continue
  ```
  showing the location of the breakpoint and the free variables that are visible
  from the callsite, this includes function arguments, let bindings, where binds,
  monadic binds, pattern binds, etc.

  If the type of a value has a `Show` instance then that will be used to generate
  the printed value, otherwise the output will contain the type of the value
  within angle brackets.

  Execution of the program effectively halts on waiting for user input. In
  concurrent programs, all threads will be stopped, not just the one executing
  the breakpoint.

  ### Querying variables

  In contrast to the standard breakpoint functions which print out the values for
  all current variables, the `queryVars`, `queryVarsM`, and `queryVarsIO`
  functions first print the variables names and then initiate a prompt where you
  can enter a specific variable name to have its value printed.

  This is useful if you are only interested in certain values or if printing one
  or more values would result in a non-terminating process (an infinite data
  structure for example).

  You can tab-complete variable names at the query prompt. Only the current
  thread is blocked while the prompt is active. To resume execution, press enter
  with a blank line.

  ### Caveats
  - Currently supports GHC version 9.2.x - 9.8.x
  - Printing values may cause thunks to be evaluated earlier than they otherwise
    would which could be problematic for programs that rely heavily on laziness.
  - `ApplicativeDo` can sometimes cause variables that are in scope to not be traced.
  - Implicit params are not currently supported
  - `RecursiveDo` binds aren't visible before they are bound, despite being in scope.
  - If there is anything buffered in `stdin` then that will interfere with the
    blocking mechanism.
  - On Windows or when using the non-threaded runtime, calls to
    `threadDelay` are not suspended by breakpoints in the sense that time
    continues to elapse, however they won't unblock until the breakpoint
    finishes.
  - Variables being traced cannot have a type that contains type variables with
    class constraints, otherwise you get a compiler error. This happens most
    commonly with a where clause binding that lacks a type signature. You can
    deal with this by using `excludeVars` or giving a type signature to the
    binding that doesn't introduce such type variables.
