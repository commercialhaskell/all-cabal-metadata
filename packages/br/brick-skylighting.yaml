  # Revision history for brick-skylighting

  1.0
  ===

   * Updated to work with `brick` 1.0.

  0.3
  ===

   * Increased Vty lower bound to 5.23.1 to support italics.
   * Skylighting token styles that used italics now translate to the Vty
     italics style rather than the standout style.

  0.2
  ===

  API changes:
   * Added `Brick.Widgets.Skylighting.highlightFromMap` to highlight text by
     looking up syntax names in a Skylighting `SyntaxMap.
   * Removed `Brick.Widgets.Skylighting.simpleHighlight` because we no
     longer have access to the bundled `SyntaxMap` of default entries in
     the `skylighting` package.

  Package changes:
   * This now depends on `skylighting-core` (BSD), not `skylighting`
     (GPL), to avoid inadvertent compilation of a GPL depdendency:

     To ensure that users of this library do not inadvertently pull in a
     dependency on a GPL'd library (skylighting), this package uses and
     depends only on the new skylighting-core package, a BSD-compatible
     subset of the skylighting functionality. The main thing we give
     up in doing this is generated Haskell modules that provide syntax
     definitions embedded in the program. Consequently users of this
     library must load the syntax definitions themselves and provide them
     to this library's functions. (skylighting could be used for that
     if desired, but we no longer force users to do so.) Please see the
     README for notes on how to deal with this.

  brick-skylighting
  =================

  ![](images/demo.png)

  This package extends the [brick](https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick)
  library with syntax highlighting support using the
  [Skylighting](https://github.com/jgm/skylighting) library.

  See the Haddock documentation for `Brick.Widgets.Skylighting` for API
  details, and see the demonstration program in `programs` for a complete
  working example.

  Note: this library requires its users to provide syntax highlighting
  definitions. For that, there are two choices:

   * Obtain XML specifications from e.g. the `skylighting-core` sources,
     then bundle these with your program files. Those files are
     GPL-licensed, so this option is preferable when you want to ship
     these GPL-licensed files with your program without the GPL infecting
     the license of your application.

   * Use the compiled-in syntax specifications in the `skylighting`
     package. This option is preferable if you are okay with a
     GPL-licensed dependency (i.e. if your application is also GPL'd) and
     you especially want to avoid having to bundle the XML files with your
     application or avoid the runtime loading of such files.
