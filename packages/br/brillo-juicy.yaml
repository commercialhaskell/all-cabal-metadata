description: |-
  Lets you convert any image supported by Juicy.Pixels in a brillo application
  by converting to brillo' Bitmap representation.
  Version 0.1.2 just enabled caching (from a frame to the next, and so on)
  of the images you load, so that they are not recomputed for each frame.
  Credits go to Jonathan Daugherty for the patch.
