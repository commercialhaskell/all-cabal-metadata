  <http://brotli.org Brotli> (<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7932 RFC7932>) is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm suitable for <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_compression HTTP compression> that compresses data using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling.

  This package provides a pure interface for compressing and
  decompressing Brotli streams of data represented as lazy @ByteString@s. A
  monadic incremental interface is provided as well. This package
  relies on Google's C implementation.

  The following packages are based on this package and provide
  API support for popular streaming frameworks:

  * </package/brotli-streams brotli-streams> (for </package/io-streams io-streams>)

  * </package/pipes-brotli pipes-brotli> (for </package/pipes pipes>)

  * </package/brotli-conduit brotli-conduit> (for </package/conduit conduit>)
