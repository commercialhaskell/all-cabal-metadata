changelog: ! "\nBrick changelog\n---------------\n\n0.37\n----\n\nBehavior changes:\n
  * `listMoveBy` now automatically moves to the first or last position\n   in the
  list if called when the list is non-empty but has no selected\n   element (thanks
  Philip Kamenarsky)\n\nAPI changes:\n * Added `Brick.Widgets.List.renderListWithIndex`
  that passes\n   the index of each element to the item rendering function (thanks\n
  \  liam@magicseaweed.com)\n\n0.36.3\n------\n\nBug fixes:\n * Fixed a bug where
  mouse-up events in viewports were not translated\n   into the global coordinate
  space, unlike mouse-down events (#173)\n\n0.36.2\n------\n\nAPI changes:\n * The
  Forms API got two new functions, `setFormConcat` and\n   `setFieldConcat`, used
  for controlling the previously hard-coded\n   concatenation behavior of form fields.
  These are optional and both\n   concatentation settings default to their former
  hard-coded values,\n   `vBox` (#172).\n\n0.36.1\n------\n\nPackage changes:\n *
  Raiseed upper bound to support GHC 8.4.2 (#171)\n\nOther changes:\n * Improved List
  accessor documentation (thanks liam <liam@magicseaweed.com>)\n * Brick.Main now
  uses a Set instead a list to track invalidation\n   requests to avoid duplicates.\n\n0.36\n----\n\nNew
  features:\n * Dynamic border support: adjacent widgets that use borders can make\n
  \  those borders seamlessly connect to each other! Thanks\n   so much to Daniel
  Wagner for this feature! Please see\n   `programs/DynamicBorderDemo.hs` for a demonstraton.
  Also see the\n   \"Joinable Borders\" section of the User Guide.\n\n0.35.1\n------\n\n
  * Conditionally depend on semigroups for GHC before 8\n\n0.35\n----\n\n * Added
  support for GHC 8.4.\n * Updated travis build to test on all 8.x releases (thanks
  Peter\n   Simons)\n\n0.34.1\n------\n\nBug fixes:\n * Fixed a bug where the \"reverseVideo\"
  style could not be parsed in a\n   theme customization when it was all lowercase
  (thanks Yuriy Lazarev)\n\nDocumentation changes:\n * Guide: added more complete
  example of creating a default theme\n   (thanks Mark Wales)\n * Guide: added offset
  to Extent pattern matching (thanks Mark Wales)\n\n0.34\n----\n\nAPI changes:\n *
  Core: vLimit and hLimit now *bound* sizes rather than setting them.\n   This was
  the original intention of these combinators. The change in\n   behavior means that
  now `vLimit N` means that *at most* `N` rows will\n   be available; if the context
  has less, then the smaller constraint in\n   the context is used instead. Programs
  affected by this behavior will\n   be those that assume that `vLimit` doesn't do
  this, but that should\n   be very few or zero.\n\nOther changes:\n * Dialog: now
  arrow keys no longer wrap around available buttons but\n   stop at rightmost or
  leftmost button to avoid confusion when\n   attempting to tell which button is selected
  in two-button dialogs\n   (thanks to Karl Ostmo for this change)\n\nDocumentation
  changes:\n * Updated Haddocks for str/txt in Core to mention tab character\n   considerations\n\n0.33\n----\n\nAPI
  changes:\n * Forms: added support for external validation of form fields using\n
  \  `setFieldValid`. See the Haddock, User Guide, and FormDemo.hs for\n   details.\n
  * Borders: removed all attribute names except `borderAttr` to simplify\n   border
  attribute assignment.\n\n0.32.1\n------\n\nBug fixes:\n * Core: make all text wrap
  widgets Greedy horizontally\n\nMiscellaneous:\n * Dialog: clarify purpose in documentation
  (w.r.t. #149)\n\n0.32\n----\n\nAPI changes:\n * This release adds the new `Brick.Forms`
  module, which provides an API\n   for type-safe input forms with automatic rendering,
  event handling,\n   and state management! See the Haddock and the \"Input Forms\"
  section\n   of the Brick User Guide for information on this killer feature! Many\n
  \  thanks to Kevin Quick for feedback on this new functionality.\n\n0.31\n----\n\nBehavior
  changes:\n * `viewport` now implicitly causes generation of mouse events for the\n
  \  viewport when mouse mode is enabled. The mouse events are expressed\n   in the
  coordinate system of the contents of the viewport. The\n   consequence and intention
  of this change is to enable mouse event\n   reporting for editors when clicks occur
  outside the known text area.\n\n0.30\n----\n\nAPI changes:\n * `Brick.Focus`: added
  `focusSetCurrent` to make it easy to set the\n    focus of a focus ring\n * `Brick.Main`:
  added a simple polymorphic `App` value, `simpleApp`\n\n0.29.1\n------\n\nBug fixes:\n
  * Mixed-case color names like \"brightBlue\" can now be parsed in theme\n   customization
  files.\n\n0.29\n----\n\nAPI changes:\n * Added Ord instances for `Location` and
  `BrickEvent` (thanks Tom\n   Sydney Kerckhove)\n * `Brick.AttrMap`: attribute name
  components are now exposed via the\n   `attrNameComponents` function. Also added
  a Read instance for\n   AttrName.\n\nNew features:\n * This release adds user-customizable
  theme support. Please see the\n   \"Attribute Themes\" section of the User Guide
  for an introduction; see\n   the Haddock documentation for `Brick.Themes` for full
  details. Also,\n   see the new `programs/ThemeDemo.hs` for a working demonstration.\n\n0.28\n----\n\nAPI
  changes:\n * Brick.AttrMap.setDefault was renamed to setDefaultAttr.\n * Added Brick.AttrMap.getDefaultAttr:
  get the default attribute from an\n   attribute map.\n * Added Brick.Widgets.Core.modifyDefAttr
  to modify the default\n   attribute of the rendering context.\n\nOther changes:\n
  * Updated AttrDemo to show usage of modifyDefAttr.\n\n0.27\n----\n\nAPI changes:\n
  * Brick.Widgets.Core: added `hyperlink` combinator (thanks Getty Ritter\n   for
  hyperlinking support)\n\nOther changes:\n * Updated AttrDemo to show how to use
  hyperlinking\n * README: Added `herms` to featured projects\n\n0.26.1\n------\n\n
  * Fixed haddock for listHandleEventVi.\n\n0.26\n----\n\nAPI changes:\n * Added Brick.Widgets.List.handleListEventVi
  to add support for\n   vi-style movements to lists (thanks Richard Alex Hofer)\n\nOther
  changes:\n * Added ListViDemo.hs to demonstrate the Vi-style handler for lists\n
  \  (thanks Richard Alex Hofer)\n\n0.25\n----\n\nAPI changes:\n * List: added page
  movement functions `listMoveByPages`,\n   `listMovePageUp`, and `listMovePageDown`
  (thanks Richard Alex Hofer)\n\nMiscellaneous:\n * Fixed a spelling mistake in the
  AttrMap haddock (thanks Edward Betts)\n\n0.24.2\n------\n\nMiscellaneous:\n * Minor
  documentation updates including a clarification for #135\n\n0.24.1\n------\n\nBug
  fixes:\n * vBox/hBox: when there is leftover space and all elements are greedy,\n
  \  spread it amongst the elements as evenly as possible instead of\n   assigning
  it all to the first element (fixes #133)\n\nPackage changes:\n * Include Sam Tay's
  brick tutorial files in extra-doc-files\n\n0.24\n----\n\nAPI changes:\n * Added
  Brick.Widgets.Core.setAvailableSize to control rendering\n   context size in cases
  where the screen size is too constraining (e.g.\n   for a floating layer that might
  be bigger than the screen).\n\nDocumentation changes:\n * Samuel Tay has contributed
  his wonderful Brick tutorial to this\n   package in docs/samtay-tutorial.md. Thank
  you!\n\n0.23\n----\n\nAPI changes:\n * getVtyHandle: always return a Vty handle
  rather than Maybe\n   (Previously, in appStartEvent you'd get Nothing because Vty
  had\n   not been initialized yet. This made various use cases impossible\n   to
  satisfy because appStartEvent is a natural place to get initial\n   terminal state
  from Vty. This change makes it so that a Vty handle is\n   always available, even
  in appStartEvent.)\n * txtWrapWith: added missing haddock\n\n0.22\n----\n\nAPI changes:\n
  * Core: added txtWrapWith and strWrapWith functions to provide control\n   over
  wrapping behavior by specifying custom wrapping settings.\n\nOther changes:\n *
  Updated TextWrapDemo.hs to demonstrate customizing wrapping settings.\n\n0.21\n----\n\nPackage
  changes:\n * Upgrade to word-wrap 0.2\n\nOther changes:\n * Brick.Types.Internal:
  improve mouse constructor haddock\n * Add a basic fill demonstration program (FillDemo.hs)\n\n0.20.1\n------\n\nBug
  fixes:\n * str: fixed an IsString constraint confusion on GHC 7.10.1\n\n0.20\n----\n\nPackage
  changes:\n * Added a dependency on \"word-wrap\" for text-wrapping.\n * Added a
  new TextWrapDemo demo program to illustrate text wrapping\n   support\n\nAPI changes:\n
  * Brick.Widgets.Core: added new functions txtWrap and strWrap to do\n   wrapping
  of long lines of text.\n\nMiscellaneous:\n * Guide: fixed event type (#126)\n\n0.19\n----\n\nAPI
  changes:\n * The editor content drawing function is now passed to renderEditor,\n
  \  not the constructor, to improve separation of presentation and\n   representation
  concerns. The corresponding Editor drawing function\n   lens and accessor were removed.\n\n0.18\n----\n\nPackage
  changes:\n * Added a dependency on data-clist.\n\nAPI changes:\n * Brick.Focus:
  removed the Functor instance for FocusRing.\n * Brick.Focus: re-implemented FocusRing
  in terms of the circular list\n   data structure from data-clist. In addition, this
  change introduced\n   \"focusRingModify\", which permits the user to use the data-clist
  API\n   to directly manipulate the FocusRing's internals. This way brick\n   doesn't
  have to re-invent the wheel on the focus ring behavior.\n\n0.17.2\n------\n\nPackage
  changes:\n * Added programs/ReadmeDemo.hs and featured its output and code in the\n
  \  README to provide an early demonstration\n\nLibrary changes:\n * centerAbout
  now right- and bottom-pads its operand to behave\n   consistently with h/vCenter\n\n0.17.1\n------\n\nPackage
  changes:\n * Use Extra-Doc-Files instead of Data-Files for documentation files\n\nBug
  fixes:\n * List: correctly update selected index in listInsert\n * Update example
  program in brick.cabal (thanks @timbod7)\n\n0.17\n----\n\nPackage changes:\n* Updated
  to depend on Vty 5.15.\n* Updated to remove dependency on data-default.\n* Discontinued
  support for GHC versions prior to 7.10.1.\n\nAPI changes:\n* Removed Data.Default
  instances for AttrName, AttrMap, Result, and\n  BorderStyle (use Monoid instances
  instead where possible).\n* Added defaultBorderStyle :: BorderStyle.\n* Added emptyResult
  :: Result n.\n\n0.16\n----\n\nThis release includes a breaking API change:\n* Brick
  now uses bounded channels (Brick.BChan.BChan) for event\n  communication rather
  than Control.Concurrent.Chan's unbounded channels\n  to improve memory consumption
  for programs with runaway event\n  production (thanks Joshua Chia)\n\nOther API
  changes:\n* Brick.List got a new function, listModify, for modifying the selected\n
  \ element (thanks @diegospd)\n\nPerformance improvements:\n* hBox and vBox now use
  the more efficient DList data structure when\n  rendering to improve performance
  for boxes with many elements (thanks\n  Mitsutoshi Aoe)\n\n0.15.2\n------\n\nBug
  fixes:\n* viewport: do not cull cursor locations on empty viewport contents\n  (fixes
  #105)\n* User guide CounterEvent type fix (thanks @diegospd)\n\n0.15.1\n------\n\nBug
  fixes:\n* List: fixed empty list validation in listReplace (thanks Joshua Chia)\n\n0.15\n----\n\nDemo
  changes:\n* MouseDemo: add an editor and use mouse events to move the cursor\n*
  MouseDemo: Enhance MouseDemo to show interaction between 'clickable'\n  and viewports
  (thanks Kevin Quick)\n\nNew features:\n* Editors now report mouse click events\n\nAPI
  changes:\n* Rename TerminalLocation row/column fields to avoid commonplace name\n
  \ clashes; rename row/column to locationRow/locationColumn (fixes #96)\n\nBug fixes:\n*
  Core: make cropToContext also crop extents (fixes #101)\n* viewport: if the sub-widget
  is not rendered, also cull all extents and\n  cursor locations\n\nDocumentation
  changes:\n* User Guide updates: minor fixes, updates to content on custom widgets,\n
  \ wide character support, and examples (thanks skapazzo@inventati.org,\n  Kevin
  Quick)\n\n0.14\n----\n\nThis release added support for wide characters. In particular,
  wide\ncharacters can now be entered into the text editor widget and used in\n'str'
  and 'txt' widgets.\n\n0.13\n----\n\nAPI changes:\n * Mouse mode is no longer enabled
  by default.\n * customMain's event channel parameter is now optional\n * FocusRing
  now provides a Functor instance (thanks Ian Jeffries)\n\n0.12\n----\n\nThis release
  primarily adds support for mouse interaction. For details,\nsee the Mouse Support
  section of the User Guide. This release also\nincludes breaking API changes for
  the App type. Here's a migration\nguide:\n\n * Event handlers now take \"BrickEvent
  n e\" instead of \"e\", where \"e\"\n   was the custom event type used before this
  change. To recover your\n   own custom events, pattern-match on \"AppEvent\"; to
  recover Vty input\n   events, pattern-match on \"VtyEvent\".\n * appLiftVtyEvent
  went away and can just be removed from your App\n   record constructor.\n * If you
  aren't using the custom event type or were just using Vty's\n   \"Event\" type as
  your App's event type, you can set your event type to\n   just \"e\" because you'll
  now be able to get Vty events regardless of\n   whether you use a custom event type.\n\nAPI
  changes:\n * Added the Widget combinator \"clickable\" to indicate that a widget\n
  \  should generate mouse click events\n * Added the Extent data type and the \"reportExtent\"
  widget combinator\n   to report the positions and sizes of widgets\n * Rendering
  \"Result\" values now include reported extents and update\n   their offsets (adds
  \"extents\" field and \"extentsL\" lens)\n * Added \"lookupExtent\", \"findClickedExtents\",
  and \"clickedExtent\" in\n   EventM to find extents and check them for mouse clicks\n
  * Removed appLiftVtyEvent. Instead of wrapping Vty's events in your own\n   type,
  you now get a \"BrickEvent\" that always contains Vty events but\n   has the ability
  to embed *your* custom events. See the User Guide for\n   details.\n * Added demo
  program MouseDemo.hs\n * Added demo program ProgressBarDemo.hs (thanks Kevin Quick)\n
  * Added mapAttrname, mapAttrNames, and overrideAttr functions (thanks\n   Kevin
  Quick)\n * Make handleEventLensed polymorphic over event type to allow use with\n
  \  custom events (thanks Kevin Quick)\n * Added Ord constraint to some library startup
  functions\n\nBug fixes:\n * Added Show instance for Editor, List (fixes #63)\n\nDocumentation
  changes:\n * Updated documentation to use new \"resource name\" terminology to\n
  \  reduce confusion and better explain the purpose of names.\n * Updated user guide
  with sections on mouse support, the rendering\n   cache, resource names, paste mode,
  and extents\n\nPackage changes:\n * Depend on Vty 5.11.3 to get mouse mode support\n\n0.11\n----\n\nAPI
  changes:\n * Added getVtyHandle in EventM for obtaining the current Vty context.\n
  \  It returns Nothing when calling the appStartEvent handler but after\n   that
  a context is always available.\n\n0.10\n----\n\nNew features:\n * Added a rendering
  cache. To use the rendering cache, use the 'cached'\n   widget combinator. This
  causes drawings of the specified widget to\n   re-use a cached rendering until the
  rendering cache is invalidated\n   with 'invalidateCacheEntry' or 'invalidateCache'.
  This change also\n   includes programs/CacheDemo.hs. This change introduced an Ord\n
  \  constraint on the name type variable 'n'.\n * Added setTop and setLeft for setting
  viewport offsets directly in\n   EventM.\n * Dialog event handlers now support left
  and right arrow keys (thanks\n   Grégoire Charvet)\n\nLibrary changes:\n * On resizes
  brick now draws the application twice before handling the\n   resize event. This
  change makes it possible for event handlers to\n   get the latest viewport states
  on a resize rather than getting the\n   most recent (but stale) versions as before,
  at the cost of a second\n   redraw.\n\nBug fixes:\n * We now use the most recent
  rendering state when setting up event handler\n   viewport data. This mostly won't
  matter to anyone except in cases\n   where a viewport name was expected to be in
  the viewport map but\n   wasn't due to using stale rendering state to set up EventM.\n\n0.9\n---\n\nPackage
  changes:\n * Depend on text-zipper 0.7.1\n\nAPI changes:\n * The editor widget state
  value is now polymorphic over the type of\n   \"string\" value that can be edited,
  so you can now create editors over\n   Text values as well as Strings. This is a
  breaking change but it only\n   requires the addition of the string type variable
  to any uses of\n   Editor. (thanks Jason Dagit and Getty Ritter)\n * Added some
  missing Eq and Show instances (thanks Grégoire Charvet)\n\nNew features:\n * The
  editor now binds Control-U to delete to beginning of line (thanks\n   Hans-Peter
  Deifel)\n\nBug fixes:\n * List: avoid runtime exception by ensuring item height
  is always at\n   least 1\n\n0.8\n---\n\nAPI changes:\n * Center: added layer-friendly
  centering functions centerLayer,\n   hCenterLayer, and vCenterLayer.\n\nFunctionality
  changes:\n * Dialog now uses new layer-friendly centering functions. This makes
  it\n   possible to overlay a Dialog on top of your UI when you use a Dialog\n   rendering
  as a separate layer.\n * Updated the LayerDemo to demonstrate a centered layer.\n
  * The renderer now uses a default Vty Picture background\n   of spaces with the
  default attribute, rather than using\n   ClearBackground (the Vty default). This
  is to compensate for an\n   unexpected attribute behavior in Vty when ClearBackgrounds
  (see\n   https://github.com/coreyoconnor/vty/issues/95)\n\n0.7\n---\n\nNOTE: this
  release includes many API changes. Please see the \"Widget\nNames\" section of the
  Brick User Guide for details on the fundamentals!\n\nAPI changes:\n * The \"Name\"
  type was removed. In its place we now have a name type\n   variable (\"n\") attached
  to many types (including EventM,\n   CursorLocation, App, Editor, List, and FocusRing).
  This change makes\n   it possible to:\n   * Avoid runtime errors due to name typos\n
  \  * Achieve compile-time guarantees about name matching and usage\n   * Force widget
  functions to be name-agnostic by being polymorphic\n     in their name type\n   *
  Clean up focus handling by making it possible to pattern-match\n     on cursor location
  names\n * The EditDemo demonstration program was updated to use a FocusRing.\n *
  Added the \"Named\" type class to Brick.Widgets.Core for types that\n   store names.
  This type class is used to streamline the Focus\n   interface; see Brick.Focus.withFocusRing
  and EditDemo.hs.\n * The List and Editor types are now parameterized on names.\n
  * The List widget is now focus-aware; its rendering function now takes\n   a boolean
  indicating whether it should be rendered with focus. The\n   List uses the following
  attributes now:\n   * When not focused, the cursor is rendered with listSelectedAttr.\n
  \  * When focused, the cursor is rendered with listSelectedFocusedAttr.\n * The
  Editor widget is now focus-aware; its rendering function now\n   takes a boolean
  indicating whether it should be rendered with focus.\n   The Editor uses the following
  attributes now:\n   * When not focused, the widget is rendered with editAttr.\n
  \  * When focused, the widget is rendered with editFocusedAttr.\n * The Dialog's
  name constructor parameter and lens were removed.\n * The 'viewport' function was
  modified to raise a runtime exception if\n   the widget name it receives is used
  more than once during the\n   rendering of a single frame.\n\nMiscellaneous:\n *
  Many modules now use conditional imports to silence redundancy\n   warnings on GHCs
  with newer Preludes (e.g. including Monoid,\n   Foldable, Traversable, Applicative,
  etc.)\n\n0.6.4\n-----\n\nBug fixes:\n * Add missing Functor instance for Next type
  (thanks Markus Hauck)\n\n0.6.3\n-----\n\nBug fixes:\n * List: the list now properly
  renders when the available height is not\n   a multiple of the item height. Previously
  the list size would\n   decrease relative to the available height. Now the list
  renders\n   enough items to fill the space even if the top-most or bottom-most\n
  \  item is partially visible, which is the expected behavior.\n\n0.6.2\n-----\n\nBug
  fixes:\n * Editor: the 'editor' initial content parameter is now correctly split\n
  \  on newlines to ensure that the underlying editor zipper is\n   initialized properly.
  (fixes #56; thanks @listx)\n\n0.6.1\n-----\n\nPackage changes:\n * Added lower bound
  for microlens >= 0.3.0.0 to fix build failure due\n   to Field1 not being defined
  (thanks Markus Hauck)\n\nDocumentation changes:\n * Updated user guide and README
  to link to and mention microlens\n   instead of lens\n\nMisc:\n * Fixed a qualified
  import in the List demo to avoid ambiguity (thanks\n   Alan Gilbert)\n\n0.6\n---\n\nAPI
  changes:\n * Brick now uses the microlens family of packages instead of lens. This\n
  \  version of brick also depends on vty 5.5.0, which was modified to use\n   microlens
  instead of lens. This change shouldn't impact functionality\n   but will greatly
  reduce build times.\n\n0.5.1\n-----\n\nBug fixes:\n * Fix negative cropping in hCenter,
  vCenter, and cropResultToContext\n   (fixes #52)\n * Remove unnecessary Eq constraint
  from listReplace (fixes #48; thanks\n   sifmelcara)\n * Mention Google Group in
  README\n\n0.5\n---\n\nFunctionality changes:\n * Markup: make markup support multi-line
  strings (fixes #41)\n * brick-edit-demo: support shift-tab to switch editors\n *
  Core: improve box layout algorithm (when rendering boxes, track\n   remaining space
  while rendering high-priority children to use\n   successively more constrained
  primary dimensions)\n * Core: make fixed padding take precedence over padded widgets
  (fixes #42)\n   Prior to this commit, padding a widget meant that if there was room\n
  \  after rendering the widget, the specified amount of padding would be\n   added.
  This meant that under tight layout constraints padding would\n   disappear before
  a padded widget would. This is often a desirable\n   outcome but it also led to
  unexpected behavior when adding padding\n   to a widget that grows greedily: fixed
  padding would never show up\n   because it was placed in a box adjacent to the widget
  in question,\n   and boxes always render greedy children before fixed ones. As a\n
  \  result fixed padding would disappear under these conditions. Instead,\n   in
  the case of fixed padding, since we often intend to *guarantee*\n   that padding
  is present, all of the padding combinators have been\n   modified so that when the
  padded widget is rendered with fixed\n   padding in the amount V, the widget is
  given V fewer rows/columns\n   when it is rendered so that the padding always has
  room.\n\n0.4.1\n-----\n\nBug fixes:\n* Fixed a bug in the 'visible' combinator:
  If the size of the visibility\n  request was larger than the available space, then
  the rendering of a\n  viewport was toggling between two states, one with aligning
  on the\n  end of the visibility request, and another one aligning on the start.\n
  \ This commit fixes it so that a visibility request is always aligned\n  on the
  start if not enough space is available. (thanks Thomas Strobel\n  <ts468@cam.ac.uk>)\n\nBehavior
  changes:\n* Honor multiple 'visible' markers in a single viewport with preference\n
  \ on the innermost request (thanks Thomas Strobel <ts468@cam.ac.uk>)\n\n0.4\n---\n\nAPI
  changes:\n* Added Brick.Widgets.Core.unsafeLookupViewport to make certain kinds\n
  \ of custom widget implementations easier when viewport states are needed\n  (thanks
  Markus Hauck <markus1189@gmail.com>)\n* List: added listClear and listReverse functions
  (thanks Markus Hauck)\n* List: Derive instances for Functor, Foldable, Traversable
  (thanks\n  Markus Hauck)\n\nDocumentation changes:\n* Hyperlink \"Data.Text.Markup\"
  inside Brick.Markup haddock (thanks\n  Markus Hauck)\n* Fix typo in 'Attribute Management'
  section of user guide (thanks\n  Markus Hauck)\n\n0.3.1\n-----\n\nBug fixes:\n*
  EventM newtype again instances MonadIO (thanks Andrew Rademacher)\n\n0.3\n---\n\nAPI
  changes:\n* Made EventM a newtype instead of a type alias\n* List: listReplace now
  takes the new selected index and no longer does\nelement diffing\n\nPackage changes:\n*
  Removed the dependency on the Diff package\n\nMisc:\n* Applied some hlint hints
  (thanks Markus Hauck <markus1189@gmail.com>)\n* Fixed a typo in the README (thanks
  Markus Hauck <markus1189@gmail.com>)\n* Improved the renderList documentation (thanks
  Profpatsch <mail@profpatsch.de>)\n* Types: added an explicit import of Applicative
  for older GHCs\n\n0.2.3\n-----\n\nBug fixes:\n* Fixed viewport behavior when the
  image in a viewport reduces its size\n  enough to render the viewport offsets invalid.
  Before, this behavior\n  caused a crash during image croppin in vty; now the behavior
  is\n  handled sanely (fixes #22; reported by Hans-Peter Deifel)\n\n0.2.2\n-----\n\nDemo
  changes:\n* Improved the list demo by using characters instead of integers in the\n
  \ demo list and cleaned up item-adding code (thanks Jøhannes Lippmann\n  <code@schauderbasis.de>)\n\n0.2.1\n-----\n\nBug
  fixes:\n* List:\n  * Fixed size policy of lists so that rather than being Fixed/Fixed,\n
  \   they are Greedy/Greedy. This resolves issues that arise when the box\n    layout
  widget renders a list widget alongside a Fixed/Fixed one.\n    (Closes issue #17,
  thanks Karl Voelker)\n* Scrolling:\n  * vScrollPage actually scrolls vertically
  now rather than horizontally\n    (Thanks Hans-Peter Deifel <hpd@hpdeifel.de>)\n\n0.2\n---\n\nAPI
  changes:\n* Added top-level `Brick` module that re-exports the most important\n
  \ modules in the library.\n* List:\n  * Now instead of passing the item-drawing
  function to the `list` state\n    constructor, it is passed to `renderList`\n  *
  `renderList` now takes the row height of the list's item widgets.\n    The list
  item-drawing function must respect this in order for\n    scrolling to work properly.
  This change made it possible to optimize\n    the list so that it only draws widgets
  visible in the viewport\n    rather than rendering all of the list's items (even
  the ones\n    off-screen). But to do this we must be able to tell in advance\n    how
  high each one is, so we require this parameter. In addition\n    this change means
  that lists no longer support items of different\n    heights.\n  * The list now
  uses Data.Vector instead of [a] to store items; this\n    permits efficient slicing
  so we can do the optimized rendering\n    described above.\n* The `HandleEvent`
  type class `handleEvent` method now runs in\n  `EventM`. This permits event-handling
  code implemented in terms of\n  `HandleEvent` to do get access to viewport state
  and to run IO code,\n  making it just as powerful as code in the top-level `EventM`
  handler.\n* Many types were moved from `Brick.Widgets.Core` and `Brick.Main` to\n
  \ `Brick.Types`, making the former module merely a home for `Widget`\n  constructors
  and combinators.\n* The `IsString` instance for `Widget` was removed; this might
  be\n  reinstated later, but this package provides enough `IsString`\n  instances
  that things can get confusing.\n* `EventM` is now reader monad over the most recent
  rendering pass's\n  viewport state, in addition to being a state monad over viewport\n
  \ requests for the renderer. Added the `lookupViewport` function to\n  provide access
  to the most recent viewport state. Exported the\n  `Viewport` type and lenses.\n*
  Now that `handleEvent` is now an `EventM` action, composition with\n  `continue`
  et al got a little messier when using lenses to\n  update the application state.
  To help with this, there is now\n  `handleEventLensed`.\n\nBugfixes:\n* Lists now
  perform well with 10 items or a million (see above; fixes\n  #7, thanks Simon Michael)\n*
  Added more haddock notes to `Brick.Widgets.Core` about growth\n  policies.\n* Forced
  evaluation of render states to address a space leak in the\n  renderer (fixes #14,
  thanks Sebastian Reuße <seb@wirrsal.net>)\n* str: only reference string content
  that can be shown (eliminates a\n  space leak, fixes #14, thanks Sebastian Reuße
  <seb@wirrsal.net>)\n\nMisc:\n* Added a makefile for the user guide.\n* List: added
  support for Home and End keys (thanks Simon Michael)\n* Viewports: when rendering
  viewports, scroll requests from `EventM` are\n  processed before visibility requests
  from the rendering process; this\n  reverses this previous order of operations but
  permits user-supplied\n  event handlers to reset viewports when desired.\n\nPackage
  changes:\n* Added `deepseq` dependency\n\n0.1\n---\n\nInitial release\n"

description: ! "![](logo/brick-final-clearbg-with-text.svg)\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jtdaugherty/brick.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jtdaugherty/brick)\n\n`brick`
  is a Haskell terminal user interface programming library in the\nstyle of [gloss](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss).
  This means\nyou write a function that describes how your user interface should look,\nbut
  the library takes care of a lot of the book-keeping that so commonly\ngoes into
  writing such programs.\n\n`brick` exposes a declarative API. Unlike most GUI toolkits
  which\nrequire you to write a long and tedious sequence of \"create a widget,\nnow
  bind an event handler\", `brick` just requires you to describe your\ninterface using
  a set of declarative combinators. Then you provide a\nfunction to transform your
  application state when input or other kinds\nof events arrive.\n\nUnder the hood,
  this library builds upon\n[vty](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/vty), so some
  knowledge of Vty\nwill be helpful in using this library.\n\nRelease Announcements

  Google Group / e-mail list is a place to discuss\nlibrary changes, give feedback,
  and ask questions. You can subscribe at:\n\n[https://groups.google.com/group/brick-users](https://groups.google.com/group/brick-users)\n\nStatus\n------\n\nThere
  are some places were I have deliberately chosen to worry about\nperformance later
  for the sake of spending more time on the design\n(and to wait on performance issues
  to arise first). `brick` is also\nsomething of an experimental project of mine and
  some aspects of the\ndesign involve trade-offs that might not be right for your
  application.\nBrick is not intended to be all things to all people; rather, I want
  it\nto provide a good foundation for building complex terminal interfaces\nin a
  declarative style to take away specific headaches of building,\nmodifying, and working
  with such interfaces, all while seeing how far we\ncan get with a pure function
  to specify the interface.\n\n`brick` exports an extension API that makes it possible
  to make your own\npackages and widgets. If you use that, you'll also be helping
  to test\nwhether the exported interface is usable and complete!\n\nReporting bugs\n--------------\n\nPlease
  file bug reports as GitHub issues.  For best results:\n\n - Include the versions
  of relevant software packages: your terminal\n   emulator, `brick`, `ghc`, and `vty`
  will be the most important\n   ones.\n\n - Clearly describe the behavior you expected
  ...\n\n - ... and include a minimal demonstration program that exhibits the\n   behavior
  you actually observed.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nIf you decide to contribute,
  that's great! Here are some guidelines you\nshould consider to make submitting patches
  easier for all concerned:\n\n - If you want to take on big things, talk to me first;
  let's have a\n   design/vision discussion before you start coding. Create a GitHub\n
  \  issue and we can use that as the place to hash things out.\n - Please make changes
  consistent with the conventions I've used in the\n   codebase.\n - Please adjust
  or provide Haddock and/or user guide documentation\n   relevant to any changes you
  make.\n - New commits should be `-Wall` clean.\n - Please do NOT include package
  version changes in your patches.\n   Package version changes are only done at release
  time when the full\n   scope of a release's changes can be evaluated to determine
  the\n   appropriate version change.\n"
