  ## v0.1.1

  - Rewrote executables with a client/server architecture for better Windows support.

  - Web interface greatly improved using WebAssembly
  - Allow synchronising scroll positions in GUI between input and output textboxes
  - Add timeout to desktop GUI to abort long-running computations
  - Allow category backreferencing with `@n` before category
  - Allow forcing nondeterminism with `@?` before category
  - Add ‘input→output’ format for output words
  - Change default output format for MDF input to wordlist in CLI
  - Add ‘or environments’ with syntax ‘target / replacement / env1 / env2 / env3 / …’.
    Former rule exceptions with similar syntax have been changed to syntax ‘target / replacement / env // exception’.

  # Brassica

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/brassica.svg?logo=haskell)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/brassica)

  Brassica is a new sound change applier.
  Its features include:

  - Can be used interactively both [online](http://bradrn.com/brassica/index.html) and as a desktop application, or non-interactively in batch mode on the command-line or as a [Haskell library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/brassica)
  - Natively supports the MDF dictionary format, also used by tools including [SIL Toolbox](https://software.sil.org/toolbox/) and [Lexique Pro](https://software.sil.org/lexiquepro/)
  - First-class support for multigraphs
  - Easy control over rule application: apply sound changes sporadically, right-to-left, between words, and in many more ways
  - Live preview and control over output highlighting let you try out sound changes quickly and easily
  - Highlight and visualise results in numerous ways
  - Category operations allow phonetic rules to be written in both featural and character-based ways
  - Support for ‘features’ lets rules easily manipulate stress, tone and other suprasegmentals
  - Comes with a paradigm builder for quickly investigating inflectional and other patterns
  - Rich syntax for specifying phonetic rules, including wildcards, optional elements and more

  And many more!

  See the [documentation](./Documentation.md) for details on Brassica usage.

  Download Brassica from the [releases page](https://github.com/bradrn/brassica/releases/latest).
  Alternately, try it online at http://bradrn.com/brassica.
  As of the time of writing prebuilt binaries exist for Windows and Linux.
  Instructions for building from source are available at [`BUILDING.md`](./BUILDING.md).
