  # Brassica

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/brassica.svg?logo=haskell)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/brassica)

  Brassica is a new sound change applier.
  Its features include:

  - Can be used interactively both [online](http://bradrn.com/brassica/index.html) and as a desktop application, or non-interactively in batch mode on the command-line or as a [Haskell library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/brassica)
  - Natively supports the MDF dictionary format, also used by tools including [SIL Toolbox](https://software.sil.org/toolbox/) and [Lexique Pro](https://software.sil.org/lexiquepro/)
  - First-class support for multigraphs
  - Easy control over rule application: apply sound changes sporadically, right-to-left, and in many more ways
  - Live preview and control over output highlighting allows fast iteration through rules
  - Category operations allow phonetic rules to be written in both featural and character-based ways
  - Support for ‘features’ lets rules easily manipulate stress, tone and other suprasegmentals
  - Comes with a paradigm builder for quickly investigating inflectional and other patterns
  - Rich syntax for specifying phonetic rules, including wildcards, optional elements and more

  And many more!

  See the [documentation](./Documentation.md) for details on Brassica usage.

  Download Brassica from the [releases page](https://github.com/bradrn/brassica/releases/latest).
  Alternately, try it online at http://bradrn.com/brassica.
  As of the time of writing prebuilt binaries exist for Windows and Linux.
  Instructions for building from source are available at [`BUILDING.md`](./BUILDING.md).
