  # Changelog for squeather

  ## Version 0.8.0.0, May 7, 2021

  * Updated SQLite library to version 3.35.5.

  * Removed references and links to Github.

  ## Version 0.6.0.0, December 29, 2020

  * Added SQLite compile-time option to disable double-quoted string literals

  ## Version 0.4.2.0, December 27, 2020

  * Updated SQLite library to version 3.34

  ## Version 0.4.0.0, February 22, 2020

  * Changed Database and Statement types so they clean
  up after themselves, so there is no need to (and, indeed,
  then cannot be) closed or finalized as they do it themselves.

  * Changed OpenFlags and associated types to make
  API self-documenting

  * Added compile-time option for threaded mode into package.yaml
  (though this is the default, so nothing should change from the
  user's persepctive)

  * open function now calls sqlite3_initialize (this should
  not result in any user-visible changes)

description: |-
  This library allows you to use databases with the version 3 series
  of the [SQLite](https://sqlite.org) C library.  The biggest difference
  between this library and others available on Hackage is that it uses the
  extended error descriptions that SQLite makes available.  It also cleans up
  resources such as database and statement handles in an automatic, though
  non-deterministic, fashion.
