  # ical

  iCalendar parser.

  Also usable as a command-line tool called `ical-org` to generate
  org-mode agenda files.

  ## Usage

      $ ical-org
      ical-org: expected <input.ics> <output.org> [--base=YYYY-MM-DD (default: 1970-01-01)]

  ## Install

      $ stack install ical

  ## Dev

      $ git clone https://github.com/chrisdone/ical.git
      $ cd ical
      $ stack build
      $ stack exec -- ical-org input.ics output.org

  ## Typical use

  I've setup on my server a crontab that will run this command every 5
  minutes.

  Here is my crontab entry:

      */5 * * * * sh /home/chris/gc-update

  Here is my `gc-update` script:

  ``` sh
  mkdir -p /tmp/ical
  cd /tmp/ical

  wget https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/chrisdone%40gmail.com/private-<my code here>/basic.ics
  /home/chris/.local/bin/ical-org basic.ics basic.org --base=2015-06-01

  cp basic.org /home/chris/Dropbox/Org/gc.org

  rm -r /tmp/ical
  ```

  My org-mode files are stored in Dropbox, so this update is replicated
  to my Dropbox which then my desktop computer will download only if
  there is any change.

  Open the file e.g. `gc.org` into an Emacs buffer and enable `M-x
  auto-revert-mode`.

  ## Known issues

  I can't be bothered to resolve time zones yet. There is some work
  involved in reading them in, involving daylight savings time. For now
  everything is assumed to be UTC, but given that the main use-case,
  outputting org-mode files, only outputs dates, this is not a huge
  problem.
