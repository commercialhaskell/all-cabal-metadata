description: |-
  This package has been renamed from bdelta to bytestring-delta, to avoid
  conflicting with an existing project by the same name:

  * <http://bdelta.org>

  Compute a patch between two ByteStrings which can later be applied to the
  first to produce the second.  This can be used to save bandwidth and disk
  space when many strings differing by a small number of bytes need to be
  transmitted or stored.

  The underlying implementation is written in C, and can also be found at
  <http://ccan.ozlabs.org/info/bdelta.html>.

  Currently, a patch does not save any space when two strings differ by
  more than 1000 bytes.  This arbitrary limit serves to keep applications
  from spiking in memory and CPU usage, as the algorithm uses quadratic
  space and time with respect to the length of the patch.  A better
  algorithm may be introduced in a future version of bdelta.
