description: "Kulitta: a Library for Automated Music Composition\r\n(c) Donya Quick
  2014-2017\r\nVersion: 2.2.1\r\n\r\nKulitta is a framework for automated composition
  that \r\ncan also be configured to run as a standalone AI for \r\ngenerating music
  in a particular style. \r\n\r\nThis library is not intended for commercial use.\r\n\r\nFor
  more information on Kulitta, go to:\r\nhttp://www.donyaquick.com/kulitta\r\n\r\nNote:
  Kulitta's graphical interface is now provided\r\nas an example use of the larger
  Kulitta library. It\r\nis located in the Examples\\GUI folder in GUI.lhs. \r\n\r\n\r\n======================\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION
  INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nTo use Kulitta, you will need Haskell Platform. \r\nPlease use
  Haskell Platform 2014 or 7.10.13. Note \r\nthat Kulitta's GUI may not work on Macs
  running \r\n7.10.3 but should work with Haskell Platform 2014.\r\n\r\nThis version
  of the code uses Euterpea 2.0 from \r\nGitHub. If you want to use Kulitta's GUI,
  you will \r\nalso need the HSoM library. See euterpea.com for \r\ninformation on
  installing these libraries.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed these, run \"cabal install\"
  \r\nfrom within the library folder (where kulitta.cabal \r\nis located). You can
  then use Kulitta by importing\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\nKulitta\r\n    Contains the
  PTGG, ChordSpaces, PostProcessing,\r\n    Search, and Constraints modules. These
  can also \r\n    be imported individually if desired.\r\n    \r\nKulitta.Grammars.MusicGrammars\r\n
  \   Some musical grammars derived from music theory\r\n    and recent publications
  on the topic.\r\n    \r\nKulitta.Foregrounds\r\n    All of Kulitta's foreground
  modules. This includes\r\n    ClassicalFG, JazzFG, and SimplePianoFG. These can\r\n
  \   also be imported individually if desired.\r\n    \r\nKulitta.Learning.Learning\r\n
  \   Kulitta's learning module, intended to be compiled\r\n    and run separately
  as in LearningMain.lhs. \r\n    \r\nPlease consult individual lhs files within the
  library\r\nfor documentation on the functions within.\r\n\r\n"
