synopsis: Configurable Knuth-Liang hyphenation
changelog: |
  0.8.2 [2021.06.28]
  ------------------
  * `Embed` flag is now `True` by default to resolve unexpected issues with standalone applications [#18](https://github.com/ekmett/hyphenation/issues/18)

  0.8.1 [2021.02.17]
  ------------------
  * The build-type has been changed from `Custom` to `Simple`.
    To achieve this, the `doctests` test suite has been removed in favor of using
    [`cabal-docspec`](https://github.com/phadej/cabal-extras/tree/master/cabal-docspec)
    to run the doctests.

  0.8 [2019.05.18]
  ----------------
  * Per-language default hyphenation minimums
  * Correct handling of UTF-8 language definitions, such as Russian.
  * `loadHyphenator` now takes a `Language` rather than the string for its affix.
  * Updated language files.
  * Added Armenian, Assamese, and Occitan.

  0.7.1 [2018.01.18]
  ------------------
  * Add `Semigroup` instances for `Exceptions` and `Patterns`.
  * Fix the build with `-fembed`.

  0.7
  ---
  * Updated Spanish and Thai hyphenation patterns.
  * Removed Lao patterns until higher quality patterns are available.
  * Updated the licenses associated with many patterns
  * Revamp `Setup.hs` to use `cabal-doctest`. This makes it build
    with `Cabal-2.0`, and makes the `doctest`s work with `cabal new-build` and
    sandboxes.

  0.6
  ---
  * Applied `gzip` to the internal data files. This shrinks the resulting library and any statically linked executable by about a meg and a half.

  0.5
  -----
  * Added support for classic Latin and Georgian. Updated language patterns to match `hyph-utf8` version #687 2014-10-13.

  0.4.2.1
  -------
  * `filepath` 1.4 support

  0.4.2
  -----
  * Fixed a typo in .cabal which prevented the `Embed` flag from working properly.

  0.4.1
  -----
  * Added support for embedding all of the pattern files into the library as resources by using `cabal install hyphenation -fembed`. This is not the default as it inflates the library size by ~3MB and forces all users to pay for all the hyphenation patterns, but it can be useful for users who aim to build standalone applications.

  0.4
  ---
  * Removed Farsi. We had no pattern files.

  0.3
  ---
  * Added Friulan, Piedmontese, Romansh and Thai language hyphenations.

  0.2.2
  -----
  * Flagged `Text.Hyphenation.Language` as `Trustworthy`. It has benign side-effects that cause it to read hyphenation files lazily from the installed `data-dir` but nothing else.

  hyphenation
  ===========

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/hyphenation.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hyphenation) [![Build Status](https://github.com/ekmett/hyphenation/workflows/Haskell-CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ekmett/hyphenation/actions?query=workflow%3AHaskell-CI)

  Configurable Knuth-Liang hyphenation using the UTF8 encoded hyphenation patterns provided by [hyph-utf8](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/language/hyph-utf8)

  Usage:

  ```haskell
  >>> hyphenate english_US "supercalifragilisticexpialadocious"
  ["su","per","cal","ifrag","ilis","tic","ex","pi","al","ado","cious"]
  ```

  ```haskell
  >>> hyphenate english_US "hyphenation"
  ["hy","phen","ation"]
  ```

  ```haskell
  >>> hyphenate icelandic "va\240lahei\240avegavinnuverkf\230rageymslusk\250r"
  ["va\240la","hei\240a","vega","vinnu","verk","f\230ra","geymslu","sk\250r"]
  ```
