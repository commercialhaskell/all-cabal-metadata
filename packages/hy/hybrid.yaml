description: |-
  We have made an implementation of the language Lambda-H,
  described in the paper "Hybrid Type Checking" by Cormac Flanagan, which uses a
  hybrid type checking system.
  We have tried to keep our implementation as close as possible to the language
  defined in Flanagan's paper. The result should be seen as a proof-of-concept,
  and an exercise in implementing a hybrid type checker for a language with
  advanced type specifications.
