  Bindings to the Sixense SDK for the Razer Hydra.
  To get started, get the SDK from Sixense (http://sixense.com/developers), install it, then install hydra.hs.
  The install script that comes with the SDK might not always work.
  To build hydra-hs, you need both sixense.h and libsixense.dylib in a location where they can be found (such as /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib).
