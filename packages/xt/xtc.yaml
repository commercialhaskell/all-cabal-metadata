description: |-
  The XTC library provides a typed interface to several wxHaskell controls.

  * radio view (typed radio box)

  * single-selection list view (typed single-selection list box)

  * muliple-selection list view (typed multiple-selection list box)

  * choice view (typed choice box)

  * value entry (typed text entry)

  XTC controls keep track of typed values and items, rather than being string based. Selections in XTC controls consist of actual values instead of indices.
