  0.5.0.0
  =======

  * Addressed a security issue that would have allowed a malicious third
    party to upload a 'unknown-vty-build-platform' package to Hackage to
    introduce malicious code on platforms where 'vty-crossplatform' isn't
    supported. Now, instead of failing to build against a fake package for
    build error readability purposes, 'buildable' is set to 'False' to
    fail the build more directly.
  * Updated to work with `vty-windows` 0.2.0.1.

  0.4.0.0
  =======

  * Updated to work with `vty-windows` 0.2.0.0.

  0.3.0.0
  =======

  Package changes:
  * Updated `vty` lower bound to 6.1. Updated testing code to build with
    6.1.

  0.2.0.0
  =======

  Package changes:
  * Added build-time selection of `vty-unix` on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD,
    Solaris, AIX, HPUX, IRIX, Hurd, and DragonflyBSD.

  0.1.0.0
  =======

  * First version.
