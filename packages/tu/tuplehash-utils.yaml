  TupleHash and ParallelHash.

  Note that this does not implement TupleHash itself, though it could be used
  to implement TupleHash given an implementation of Keccak/SHA-3.  This only
  implements the data-encoding portions of TupleHash, and does not directly
  implement any kind of cryptographic state machine.
