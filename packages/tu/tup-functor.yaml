description: |-
  Homogeneous tuples (also known as vectors), with various instances, most notably 'Functor' and 'Applicative'.
  The primary goal of the library is to help functor-oriented programming
  (for low-dimensional linear algebra, there are more specific packages, eg. @vect@).
  A small preprocessor for a tuple syntax is also included. We provide 4 different implementations,
  with a unified type class interface.
