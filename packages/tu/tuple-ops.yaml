description: |-
  Some operations on n-ary tuples, including 'uncons', 'cons', etc. This package distinguish itself from other packages
  on tuple mainly on the the implementation under the cover. It converts Generic datatype into the its representation
  form, and carries out the operations on there.  The other point is that this package tends to treat non-tuples directly as
  1-ary, without need of 'OneTuple' or similar intermediate wrapper.
