description: |-
  turing-music interprets 42 built-in Turing machines with 5 states and 2 symbols.
  In every 0.1 second, a motion is done and the contents of the tape is printed.
  At the same time, a sound is played. The pitch of the sound depends on the position of the last change
  on the tape.

  The built-in machines are busy beaver candidates.
  A busy beaver is a Turing machine which, when given an empty tape, does a lot of work, then halts.
  Currently it is not known whether these simple machines halt or not.
