description: "supernova\n=========\n\n[![CI Status](https://github.com/cr-org/supernova/workflows/Haskell%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cr-org/supernova/actions)\n\n⚠️
  \ **it is still very much under development \U0001F6A7 so use it at your own risk**
  ⚠️\n\nA *supernova* is a powerful and luminous stellar explosion. This transient
  astronomical event occurs during the last evolutionary stages of a massive star
  or when a white dwarf is triggered into runaway nuclear fusion. The original object,
  called the progenitor, either collapses to a [neutron](https://github.com/cr-org/neutron)
  star or black hole, or is completely destroyed. The peak optical luminosity of a
  supernova can be comparable to that of an entire galaxy before fading over several
  weeks or months.\n\n[![supernova](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/images/largesize/PIA22352_hires.jpg
  \"Kepler Beyond Planets: Finding Exploding Stars (Type Ia Supernova from a White
  Dwarf Stealing Matter)\")](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA22352)\n\n###
  Quick Start\n\nThe example located in `test/Main.hs` showcases a consumer & producer
  running concurrently (needs the `async` library).\n\n```haskell\nmain :: IO ()\nmain
  = runPulsar conn $ do\n  c <- newConsumer topic sub\n  p <- newProducer topic\n
  \ liftIO $ program c p\n\nconn :: PulsarConnection\nconn = connect defaultConnectData\n\ntopic
  :: Topic\ntopic = defaultTopic \"app\"\n\nsub :: Subscription\nsub = Subscription
  Exclusive \"test-sub\"\n\nprogram :: Consumer IO -> Producer IO -> IO ()\nprogram
  Consumer {..} Producer {..} =\n  let c = fetch >>= \\(Message i m) -> msgDecoder
  m >> ack i >> c\n      p = sleep 3 >> traverse_ send messages >> p\n  in  concurrently_
  c p\n```\n\nA `Message` contains a `MessageID` you need for `ack`ing and a payload
  defined as a lazy `ByteString`.\n\n> Note that we wait a few seconds before publishing
  a message to make sure the consumer is already subscribed. Otherwise, it might miss
  some messages.\n\nRun it with the following command:\n\n```shell\ncabal new-run
  supernova-tests\n```\n\nBy default, it logs to the standard output in DEBUG level.
  You can change it by suppling `LogOptions` to the alternative function `runPulsar'`.\n\n```haskell\nrunPulsar'
  :: LogOptions -> PulsarConnection -> Pulsar a -> IO ()\n```\n\n### Streaming\n\nSince
  both consumers and producers operate on any `MonadIO m`, we could leverage some
  streaming libraries. Here's the same example using [streamly](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streamly).\n\n```haskell\nimport
  \          Streamly\nimport qualified Streamly.Prelude              as S\n\nprogram
  :: Consumer IO -> Producer IO -> IO ()\nprogram Consumer {..} Producer {..} =\n
  \ let c = fetch >>= \\(Message i m) -> msgDecoder m >> ack i >> c\n      p = sleep
  3 >> traverse_ send messages >> p\n  in  S.drain . asyncly . maxThreads 10 $ S.yieldM
  c <> S.yieldM p\n```\n\n### Development\n\nIt is recommended to use [Cachix](https://app.cachix.org/cache/hpulsar)
  to reduce the compilation time.\n\n```shell\nnix-build\n```\n\nOr within a Nix shell
  (run `nix-shell` at the project's root).\n\n```shell\ncabal new-build\n```\n\n####
  Generate Hackage tarball\n\n```shell\ncabal new-sdist\n```\n\n#### Upload documentation\n\n```shell\ncabal
  new-haddock --haddock-for-hackage --enable-doc\ncabal upload -d dist-newstyle/supernova-0.0.2-docs.tar.gz
  --publish\n```\n"
