description: |-
  A supervisor monad that explore the execution tree of an internal monad and define extra behaviours thanks to flexible instance definitions for each particular purpose.
  It can inject new behaviours for backtracking, trace generation, testing, transaction rollbacks etc

  The supervisor monad is used in the package MFlow to control the routing, state management, back button management and navigation in general.

  Currently only the generation of an execution trace on case of error is developped. See @Control.Monad.Supervisor.Trace@ and the example at @Demos/TraceExample.hs@
