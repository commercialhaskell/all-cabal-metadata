  ## The interface

  `Next` is a [supply-chain] interface for possibly-finite enumeration. It is
  defined in `Next.Interface.Type` as follows:

  ```haskell
  data Next item result =
      (result ~ Step item) => Next
  ```

  ```haskell
  data Step item = Item item | End
  ```

  It is envisioned some of the utilities in this package may usefully extend to
  more complex supply-chain interfaces, in which "next" appears as one of many
  operations in a larger interface. The utilities we provide are therefore
  polymorphic where possible. The class that permits this polymorphism, defined
  in `Next.Interface.Class`, is called `TerminableStream`.

  ```haskell
  class TerminableStream item interface | interface -> item where
      next :: interface (Step item)
  ```


  ## Type aliases

  A *producer* is a vendor whose downward-facing interface is a stream; it
  provides items. A *consumer* is a job whose upward-facing interface is a stream;
  it consumes items. A *pipe* is a vendor whose up and down interfaces are both
  streams, possibly of differing item types; it both consumes and provides items.

  ```haskell
  type Producer action item         = Vendor (Const Void) (Next item)  action
  type Pipe     action item1 item2  = Vendor (Next item1) (Next item2) action
  type Consumer action item product = Job    (Next item) action product
  ```

  The "plus" variants of these aliases are more general in their upstream
  interfaces and have an additional parameter to describe exactly what the
  upstream interface is.

  ```haskell
  type ProducerPlus up action item         =                              Vendor up (Next item)  action
  type PipePlus     up action item1 item2  = TerminableStream item1 up => Vendor up (Next item2) action
  type ConsumerPlus up action item product = TerminableStream item  up => Job    up action product
  ```


  ## The Stream type

  `Stream` is a bonus feature, simply a newtype for `Producer`. This can help
  abstract away from the `supply-chain` library to simplify compiler feedback,
  and it may be easier to use if you do not need the full generality of the
  `supply-chain` library.

  ```haskell
  newtype Stream action item =
      Stream{ producer :: Producer action item }
  ```

  `Stream` has some class instances, but otherwise this library offers no
  utilities for working with `Stream`. Instead, work with the `Producer` type
  and wrap/unwrap the `Stream` constructor as needed.


  ## Other libraries

  `supply-next` is one contribution to the [supply-chain] library ecosystem.

  A consumer can be constructed from an `EffectfulFold`; this type is from the
  [gambler] library, which contains a number of common ways to construct folds.

  See also [foldl], whose `FoldM` type is the same as `EffectfulFold`, for more
  ideas about what kinds of things you can express as folds.

  The terms *producer*, *pipe*, and *consumer* are borrowed from [pipes]. The
  `Stream` type is also inspired by the inclusion of the `ListT` bonus type in
  pipes.

  If you are only using `Stream` and do not need the general facilities of
  [supply-chain] at all, the `ListT` type in [list-transformer] may be a more
  appropriate choice. Consider also that a type as simple as `IO (Maybe item)`
  can also suffice to represent an effectful stream.
