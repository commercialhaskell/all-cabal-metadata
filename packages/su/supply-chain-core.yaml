  ## Story

  The initial idea for this library stemmed from the [pipes] library. The
  interfaces of a pipes [Proxy] are given by four types: What the proxy sends
  upstream, receives from upstream, sends downstream, and receives from
  downstream. A value of type `Proxy a' a b' b m r` is depicted in the pipes
  documentation as follows:

  ```
  Upstream | Downstream
      +---------+
      |         |
  a' <==       <== b'
      |         |
  a  ==>       ==> b
      |    |    |
      +----|----+
           v
           r
  ```

  A pipes server (focusing on downstream side) can accept exactly one of request
  (`b'`) and issue exactly one type of response (`b`). The response type cannot
  vary based on what type of request it is responding to.

  When interfaces are described by a *type constructor* rather than a pair of
  types, then we can pair types of requests with appropriate responses. I first
  saw this approach in the [haxl] library. The [Facebook example] in haxl's
  documentation gives this example of what it calls a "data source API":

  ```haskell
  data FacebookReq response =
       (response ~ Object)   => GetObject Id
     | (response ~ User)     => GetUser UserId
     | (response ~ [Friend]) => GetUserFriends UserId
  ```

  The kind of `FacebookReq` is `Type -> Type`. The phantom type variable
  `response` here indicates what type of response a data source must give in
  response to a `FacebookReq response`. For example, the `GetUser` constructor
  produces a request of type `FacebookReq User`, and so the data source returns a
  value of type `User`.

  This pattern can also be found in the [effectful] library, where a similar sort
  of type constructor is called a "dynamic effect". To take just one example of a
  dynamic effect that the library offers, its [dynamic State effect] (analogous to
  [StateT] of the [transformers] library) is defined as follows:

  ```haskell
  data State s m response =
        (response ~ s)  => Get
      | (response ~ ()) => Put s
      | (response ~ a)  => State (s -> (a, s))
      | (response ~ a)  => StateM (s -> m (a, s))
  ```

  The kind of `State s m` is, again, `Type -> Type`, and a constraint on each
  constructor specifies what type of corresponding response is expected.

  Let us return our attention to the pipes [Proxy] type. When we attempt to alter
  `Proxy` to employ the type constructor interface style as discussed in the
  previous two examples, it becomes apparent that much of the generality and
  symmetry that the pipes library enjoys must be sacrificed. Our library has only
  "pull" streams, in which a vendor's action is always a response to a downstream
  request. Pipes discusses "push" streams, in which upstream actors may take
  initiative, and we offer nothing of the sort.

  Also unlike pipes, we have separate `Vendor` and `Job` types, whereas pipes
  unifies upstream and downstream ideas into a single type called `Proxy`, of
  which `Producer` and `Consumer` are merely aliases with a few of the type
  parameters fixed. Although we have opted not to to so, it would be possible for
  supply-chain to mimic the pipes design, observing that `loop` and `once`
  demonstrate an isomorphism between `Vendor up (Unit product) action` and
  `Job up action product` and that would permit unifying `Vendor` and `Job` in
  the pipes style.

  ```haskell
  loop :: Job up action product -> Vendor up (Unit product) action
  once :: Vendor up (Unit product) action -> Job up action product
  ```

  This approach is tempting chiefly because it permits a single connection
  operator (which pipes calls `>->`) where supply-chain has two (`>->` and `>-`).
  But in our library, this unification appears to cause more problems than it
  solves, and type aliases in general tend to result in poor developer
  experiences.

  I also explored the possibility of defining a pipes-like unified `>->` operator
  as a multi-parameter typeclass method, with one instance for vendor-to-vendor
  connection and another for vendor-to-job connection. This can be made to work,
  and with the help of [functional dependencies] can even lend itself to
  sufficient type inference despite a large number of type parameters involved. In
  practice, however, the complication that the polymorphism introduces to type
  errors and typed hole feedback outweighs the benefit of an overloaded connection
  operator.

  Another difference between supply-chain and pipes is that `Vendor` cannot
  return. The ability of a `Producer` or `Pipe` to return is a point of difficulty
  for me as a pipes user, because in a pipes chain `a >-> b >-> c` very rarely is
  there any reason why `a` or `b` would ever return and "shut the pipeline down
  early". The advantage of this approach in pipes is that it allows `Producer`
  (being simply an alias for `Proxy`) to be monad, whereas to define a `Vendor`
  one must take the additional step of applying the `Vendor` constructor to a
  function whose actual monadic context is `Job`. The advantage of the
  supply-chain approach is that the type signatures for vendors are not burdened
  with an irrelevant type parameter representing the return type of something that
  will never actually return.

  The influence of the [effectful] library, in spirit if not manifest in any
  concrete technique, deserves remark. A job's upstream interface and action
  context correspond to what the effectful library calls "dynamic effects" and
  "static effects" respectively. Our `(>-)` function corresponds roughly to what
  effectful describes as "reinterpeting" the job's upstream interface.

  What effectful has that supply-chain lacks is its mechanism for combining
  multiple interfaces (which they call "effects") via the type-level list which
  parameterizes the [Eff] type.

  ```haskell
  data Eff (es :: [Effect]) a

  type Effect = (Type -> Type) -> Type -> Type
  ```

  I have left this feature out because I do not currently have any pressing need
  for it, I find it too difficult to use, and I am not convinced that it needs to
  be built into this library. It is possible to express the combination of two
  supply-chain interfaces as:

  ```haskell
  data Either interface1 interface2 response =
      Left (interface1 response) | Right (interface2 response)
  ```

  `Either` may be nested to produce interface combinations larger than two.
  Although this approach is cumbersome, it does suggest that more clever
  conveniences could be designed.
