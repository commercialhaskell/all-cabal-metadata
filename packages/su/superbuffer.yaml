  # Haskell SuperBuffer

  The `superbuffer` packages was designed to efficiently build up bytestrings from `IO` actions producing
  smaller chunks. The goal was to reduce memory overhead as much as possible while still being as fast as possible.
  In our use case, it reduced total memory usage of the program from `350 MB` (`bytestring` builder) to `50 MB` (`superbuffer`).
  For speed see benchmarks below. Note that the speed heavily depends on a good choice of the initial buffer size. `superbuffer` outperforms or performs similar to the `bytestring` alternatives consistently. `superbuffer` outperforms `buffer-builder`.

  ## Usage

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
  module Example where

  import Data.ByteString.SuperBuffer
  import qualified Data.ByteString as BS

  myBS :: IO BS.ByteString
  myBS =
      -- note: performance of superbuffer heavily depends on a
      -- smart choice of the initial buffer size. Benchmark to
      -- find what suits your needs.
      withBuffer 1024 $ \buf ->
      do appendBuffer buf "Hello "
         appendBuffer buf "World!"
  ```
