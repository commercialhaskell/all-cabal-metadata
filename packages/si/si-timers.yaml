  # [SI] Timers

  The `si-timers` package provides delays & timeouts which are safe on 32-bit
  systems; cancellable timeouts (see `registerDelayCancellable`); a refined
  interface for monotonic `Time`.  `Time` is given with left monoid action of
  `DiffTime` (which encodes the notion of time differences).  The
  `MonadMonotonicTime`, `MonadDelay` type classes & `MonadTimers` (type synonym)
  API provide a consistent interface for working with delays and timeouts.

  `si-timers` package also defined a low level `MonadTimout` type class.  On
  system with a native timer manager (e.g. `Linux`, `MacOS`, `FreeBSD`), it's
  very efficient but for other platforms (e.g.  `Windows`), it might not be the
  right API for low latency timeouts needed for example for low level networking
  code, because it relies on `GHC`'s `RTS` thread scheduling.

  `si-timers` are compatible with `io-sim`.

  The `SI` comes from the [International System of Units][SI].
