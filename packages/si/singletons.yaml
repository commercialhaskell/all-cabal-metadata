synopsis: A framework for generating singleton types
changelog: ! "Changelog for singletons project\n================================\n\n2.2\n---\n*
  With `TypeInType`, we no longer kind `KProxy`. @int-index has very helpfully\nremoved
  the use of `KProxy` from `singletons`.\n\n* Drop support for GHC 7.x.\n\n* Remove
  `bugInGHC`. That function was intended to work around GHC's difficulty\nin detecting
  exhaustiveness of GADT pattern matches. GHC 8 comes with a much\nbetter exhaustiveness
  checker, and so this function is no longer necessary.\n\n2.1\n---\n* Require `th-desugar`
  >= 1.6\n\n* Work with GHC 8. GHC 8 gives the opportunity to simplify some pieces
  of\nsingletons, but these opportunities are not yet fully realized. For example,\ninjective
  type families means that we no longer need `Sing` to be a data\nfamily; it could
  be a type family. This might drastically simplify the way\nfunctions are singletonized.
  But not yet!\n\n* `singletons` now outputs a few more type/kind annotations to help
  GHC do\ntype inference. There may be a few more programs accepted than before.\n(This
  is the fix for #136.)\n\n2.0.1\n-----\n * Lots more functions in `Data.Singletons.Prelude.List`:\n
  \  `filter`, `find`, `elemIndex`, `elemIndices`, `findIndex`, `findIndices`,\n   `intersect`,
  `intersectBy`, `takeWhile`, `dropWhile`, `dropWhileEnd`,\n   `span`, `break`, `take`,
  `drop`, `splitAt`, `group`, `maximum`,\n   `minimum`, `insert`, `sort`, `groupBy`,
  `lookup`, `partition`,\n   `sum`, `product`, `length`, `replicate`, `transpose`,
  `(!!)`,\n   `nub`, `nubBy`, `unionBy`, `union`, `genericLength`\n\n2.0.0.2\n-------\n
  * Fix fixity of `*`.\n\n2.0.0.1\n-------\n * Make haddock work.\n\n2.0\n---\n\n*
  Instance promotion now works properly -- it was quite buggy in 1.0.\n\n* Classes
  and instances can now be singletonized.\n\n* Limited support for functional dependencies.\n\n*
  We now have promoted and singletonized versions of `Enum`, as well as `Bounded`.\n\n*
  Deriving `Enum` is also now supported.\n\n* Ditto for `Num`, which includes an instance
  for `Nat`, naturally.\n\n* Promoting a literal number now uses overloaded literals
  at the type level,\nusing a type-level `FromInteger` in the type-level `Num` class.\n\n*
  Better support for dealing with constraints. Some previously-unsingletonizable\nfunctions
  that have constrained parameters now work.\n\n* No more orphan `Quasi` instances!\n\n*
  Support for functions of arity 8 (instead of the old limit, 7).\n\n* Full support
  for fixity declarations.\n\n* A raft of bugfixes.\n\n* Drop support for GHC 7.8.
  You must have GHC 7.10.2.\n\n1.1.2.1\n-------\n\nFix bug #116, thus allowing locally-declared
  symbols to be used in GHC 7.10.\n\n1.1.2\n-----\n\n* No more GHC 7.8.2 support --
  you must have GHC 7.8.3.\n\n1.1.1\n-----\n\nUpdate testsuite to work with th-desugar-1.5.2.
  No functional changes.\n\n1.1\n---\n\nThis is a maintenance release to support building
  (but *not* testing, due to\nGHC bug #10058) with 7.10. This release also targets
  th-desugar-1.5. Some\ntypes changed (using th-desugar's new `DsMonad` instead of
  `Quasi`), but\nclients generally won't need to make any changes, unless they, too,
  generalize\nover `Quasi`.\n\n1.0\n---\n\nThis is a complete rewrite of the package.\n\n*
  A much wider array of surface syntax is now accepted for promotion\nand singletonization,
  including `let`, `case`, partially-applied functions,\nand anonymous functions,
  `where`, sections, among others.\n\n* Classes and instances can be promoted (but
  not singletonized).\n\n* Derivation of promoted instances for `Ord` and `Bounded`.\n\nThis
  release can be seen as a \"technology preview\". More features are coming\nsoon.\n\nThis
  version drops GHC 7.6 support.\n\n0.10.0\n------\n\nTemplate Haskell names are now
  more hygienic. In other words, `singletons`\nwon't try to gobble up something happened
  to be named `Sing` in your project.\n(Note that the Template Haskell names are not
  *completely* hygienic; names\ngenerated during singleton generation can still cause
  conflicts.)\n\nIf a function to be promoted or singletonized is missing a type signature,\nthat
  is now an *error*, not a warning.\n\nAdded a new external module Data.Singletons.TypeLits,
  which contain the\nsingletons for GHC.TypeLits. Some convenience functions are also
  provided.\n\nThe extension `EmptyCase` is no longer needed. This caused pain when
  trying\nto support both GHC 7.6.3 and 7.8.\n\n0.9.3\n-----\n\nFix export list of
  Data.Singletons.TH, again again.\n\nAdd `SEq` instances for `Nat` and `Symbol`.\n\n0.9.2\n-----\n\nFix
  export list of Data.Singletons.TH, again.\n\n0.9.1\n-----\n\nFix export list of
  Data.Singletons.TH.\n\n0.9.0\n-----\n\nMake compatible with GHC HEAD, but HEAD reports
  core lint errors sometimes.\n\nChange module structure significantly. If you want
  to derive your own\nsingletons, you should import `Data.Singletons.TH`. The module\n`Data.Singletons`
  now exports functions only for the *use* of singletons.\n\nNew modules `Data.Singletons.Bool`,
  `...Maybe`, `...Either`, and `...List`\nare just like their equivalents from `Data.`,
  except for `List`, which is\nquite lacking in features.\n\nFor singleton equality,
  use `Data.Singletons.Eq`.\n\nFor propositional singleton equality, use `Data.Singletons.Decide`.\n\nNew
  module `Data.Singletons.Prelude` is meant to mirror the Haskell Prelude,\nbut with
  singleton definitions.\n\nStreamline representation of singletons, resulting in
  *exponential* speedup\nat execution. (This has not been rigorously measured, but
  the data structures\nare now *exponentially* smaller.)\n\nAdd internal support for
  TypeLits, because the TypeLits module no longer\nexports singleton definitions.\n\nAdd
  support for existential singletons, through the `toSing` method of\n`SingKind`.\n\nRemove
  the `SingE` class, bundling its functionality into `SingKind`.\nThus, the `SingRep`
  synonym has also been removed.\n\nName change: `KindIs` becomes `KProxy`.\n\nAdd
  support for singletonizing calls to `error`.\n\nAdd support for singletonizing empty
  data definitions.\n\n0.8.6\n-----\n\nMake compatible with GHC HEAD, but HEAD reports
  core lint errors sometimes.\n\n0.8.5\n-----\n\nBug fix to make singletons compatible
  with GHC 7.6.1.\n\nAdded git info to cabal file.\n\n0.8.4\n-----\n\nUpdate to work
  with latest version of GHC (7.7.20130114).\n\nNow use branched type family instances
  to allow for promotion of functions\nwith overlapping patterns.\n\nPermit promotion
  of functions with constraints by omitting constraints.\n\n0.8.3\n-----\n\nUpdate
  to work with latest version of GHC (7.7.20121031).\n\nRemoved use of Any to simulate
  kind classes; now using KindOf and OfKind\nfrom GHC.TypeLits.\n\nMade compatible
  with GHC.TypeLits.\n\n0.8.2\n-----\n\nAdded this changelog\n\nUpdate to work with
  latest version of GHC (7.6.1). (There was a change to\nTemplate Haskell).\n\nMoved
  library into Data.Singletons.\n\n0.8.1\n-----\n\nUpdate to work with latest version
  of GHC. (There was a change to\nTemplate Haskell).\n\nUpdated dependencies in cabal
  to include the newer version of TH.\n\n0.8\n---\n\nInitial public release\n"

description: ! "singletons 2.2\n==============\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/goldfirere/singletons.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/goldfirere/singletons)\n\nThis
  is the README file for the singletons library. This file contains all the\ndocumentation
  for the definitions and functions in the library.\n\nThe singletons library was
  written by Richard Eisenberg, eir@cis.upenn.edu, and\nwith significant contributions
  by Jan Stolarek, jan.stolarek@p.lodz.pl.  There\nare two papers that describe the
  library. Original one, _Dependently typed\nprogramming with singletons_, is available\n[here](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~eir/papers/2012/singletons/paper.pdf)
  and will\nbe referenced in this documentation as the \"singletons paper\". A follow-up\npaper,
  _Promoting Functions to Type Families in Haskell_, is available\n[here](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~eir/papers/2014/promotion/promotion.pdf)\nand
  will be referenced in this documentation as the\n\"promotion paper\".\n\nPurpose
  of the singletons library\n---------------------------------\n\nThe library contains
  a definition of _singleton types_, which allow programmers\nto use dependently typed
  techniques to enforce rich constraints among the types\nin their programs. See the
  singletons paper for a more thorough introduction.\n\nThe package also allows _promotion_
  of term-level functions to type-level\nequivalents. Accordingly, it exports a Prelude
  of promoted and singletonized\nfunctions, mirroring functions and datatypes found
  in Prelude, `Data.Bool`,\n`Data.Maybe`, `Data.Either`, `Data.Tuple` and `Data.List`.
  See the promotion\npaper for a more thorough introduction.\n\nCompatibility\n-------------\n\nThe
  singletons library requires GHC 8.0.1 or greater. Any code that uses the\nsingleton
  generation primitives needs to enable a long list of GHC\nextensions. This list
  includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the\nfollowing:\n\n* `ScopedTypeVariables`\n*
  `TemplateHaskell`\n* `TypeFamilies`\n* `GADTs`\n* `KindSignatures`\n* `TypeOperators`\n*
  `FlexibleContexts`\n* `RankNTypes`\n* `UndecidableInstances`\n* `FlexibleInstances`\n*
  `InstanceSigs`\n* `DefaultSignatures`\n* `TypeInType`\n\nYou may also want\n\n*
  `-Wno-redundant-constraints`\n\nas the code that `singletons` generates uses redundant
  constraints, and there\nseems to be no way, without a large library redesign, to
  avoid this.\n\nModules for singleton types\n---------------------------\n\n`Data.Singletons`
  exports all the basic singletons definitions. Import this\nmodule if you are not
  using Template Haskell and wish only to define your\nown singletons.\n\n`Data.Singletons.TH`
  exports all the definitions needed to use the Template\nHaskell code to generate
  new singletons.\n\n`Data.Singletons.Prelude` re-exports `Data.Singletons` along
  with singleton\ndefinitions for various Prelude types. This module provides a singletonized\nequivalent
  of the real `Prelude`. Note that not all functions from original\n`Prelude` could
  be turned into singletons.\n\n`Data.Singletons.Prelude.*` modules provide singletonized
  equivalents of\ndefinitions found in the following `base` library modules: `Data.Bool`,\n`Data.Maybe`,
  `Data.Either`, `Data.List`, `Data.Tuple` and `GHC.Base`. We also\nprovide singletonized
  `Eq` and `Ord` typeclasses\n\n`Data.Singletons.Decide` exports type classes for
  propositional equality.\n\n`Data.Singletons.TypeLits` exports definitions for working
  with `GHC.TypeLits`.\n\n`Data.Singletons.Void` exports a `Void` type, shamelessly
  copied from\nEdward Kmett's `void` package, but without the great many package dependencies\nin
  `void`.\n\nModules for function promotion\n------------------------------\n\nModules
  in `Data.Promotion` namespace provide functionality required for\nfunction promotion.
  They mostly re-export a subset of definitions from\nrespective `Data.Singletons`
  modules.\n\n`Data.Promotion.TH` exports all the definitions needed to use the Template\nHaskell
  code to generate promoted definitions.\n\n`Data.Promotion.Prelude` and `Data.Promotion.Prelude.*`
  modules re-export all\npromoted definitions from respective `Data.Singletons.Prelude`\nmodules.
  `Data.Promotion.Prelude.List` adds a significant amount of functions\nthat couldn't
  be singletonized but can be promoted. Some functions still don't\npromote - these
  are documented in the source code of the module. There is also\n`Data.Promotion.Prelude.Bounded`
  module that provides promoted `PBounded`\ntypeclass.\n\nFunctions to generate singletons\n--------------------------------\n\nThe
  top-level functions used to generate singletons are documented in the\n`Data.Singletons.TH`
  module. The most common case is just calling `singletons`,\nwhich I'll describe
  here:\n\n    singletons :: Q [Dec] -> Q [Dec]\n\nGenerates singletons from the definitions
  given. Because singleton generation\nrequires promotion, this also promotes all
  of the definitions given to the\ntype level.\n\nUsage example:\n\n```haskell\n$(singletons
  [d|\n  data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat\n  pred :: Nat -> Nat\n  pred Zero = Zero\n  pred
  (Succ n) = n\n  |])\n```\n\nDefinitions used to support singletons\n--------------------------------------\n\nPlease
  refer to the singletons paper for a more in-depth explanation of these\ndefinitions.
  Many of the definitions were developed in tandem with Iavor Diatchki.\n\n    data
  family Sing (a :: k)\n\nThe data family of singleton types. A new instance of this
  data family is\ngenerated for every new singleton type.\n\n    class SingI (a ::
  k) where\n      sing :: Sing a\n\nA class used to pass singleton values implicitly.
  The `sing` method produces\nan explicit singleton value.\n\n    data SomeSing (kproxy
  :: KProxy k) where\n      SomeSing :: Sing (a :: k) -> SomeSing ('KProxy :: KProxy
  k)\n\nThe `SomeSing` type wraps up an _existentially-quantified_ singleton. Note
  that\nthe type parameter `a` does not appear in the `SomeSing` type. Thus, this
  type\ncan be used when you have a singleton, but you don't know at compile time
  what\nit will be. `SomeSing ('KProxy :: KProxy Thing)` is isomorphic to `Thing`.\n\n
  \   class (kparam ~ 'KProxy) => SingKind (kparam :: KProxy k) where\n      type
  DemoteRep kparam :: *\n      fromSing :: Sing (a :: k) -> DemoteRep kparam\n      toSing
  \  :: DemoteRep kparam -> SomeSing kparam\n\nThis class is used to convert a singleton
  value back to a value in the\noriginal, unrefined ADT. The `fromSing` method converts,
  say, a\nsingleton `Nat` back to an ordinary `Nat`. The `toSing` method produces\nan
  existentially-quantified singleton, wrapped up in a `SomeSing`.\nThe `DemoteRep`
  associated\nkind-indexed type family maps a proxy of the kind `Nat`\nback to the
  type `Nat`.\n\n    data SingInstance (a :: k) where\n      SingInstance :: SingI
  a => SingInstance a\n    singInstance :: Sing a -> SingInstance a\n\nSometimes you
  have an explicit singleton (a `Sing`) where you need an implicit\none (a dictionary
  for `SingI`). The `SingInstance` type simply wraps a `SingI`\ndictionary, and the
  `singInstance` function produces this dictionary from an\nexplicit singleton. The
  `singInstance` function runs in constant time, using\na little magic.\n\n\nEquality
  classes\n----------------\n\nThere are two different notions of equality applicable
  to singletons: Boolean\nequality and propositional equality.\n\n* Boolean equality
  is implemented in the type family `(:==)` (which is actually\na synonym for the
  type family `(==)` from `Data.Type.Equality`) and the class\n`SEq`. See the `Data.Singletons.Prelude.Eq`
  module for more information.\n\n* Propositional equality is implemented through
  the constraint `(~)`, the type\n`(:~:)`, and the class `SDecide`. See modules `Data.Type.Equality`
  and\n`Data.Singletons.Decide` for more information.\n\nWhich one do you need? That
  depends on your application. Boolean equality has\nthe advantage that your program
  can take action when two types do _not_ equal,\nwhile propositional equality has
  the advantage that GHC can use the equality\nof types during type inference.\n\nInstances
  of both `SEq` and `SDecide` are generated when `singletons` is called\non a datatype
  that has `deriving Eq`. You can also generate these instances\ndirectly through
  functions exported from `Data.Singletons.TH`.\n\n\nPre-defined singletons\n----------------------\n\nThe
  singletons library defines a number of singleton types and functions\nby default:\n\n*
  `Bool`\n* `Maybe`\n* `Either`\n* `Ordering`\n* `()`\n* tuples up to length 7\n*
  lists\n\nThese are all available through `Data.Singletons.Prelude`. Functions that\noperate
  on these singletons are available from modules such as `Data.Singletons.Bool`\nand
  `Data.Singletons.Maybe`.\n\nPromoting functions\n-------------------\n\nFunction
  promotion allows to generate type-level equivalents of term-level\ndefinitions.
  Almost all Haskell source constructs are supported -- see last\nsection of this
  README for a full list.\n\nPromoted definitions are usually generated by calling
  `promote` function:\n\n```haskell\n$(promote [d|\n  data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat\n
  \ pred :: Nat -> Nat\n  pred Zero = Zero\n  pred (Succ n) = n\n  |])\n```\n\nEvery
  promoted function and data constructor definition comes with a set of\nso-called
  \"symbols\". These are required to represent partial application at the\ntype level.
  Each function gets N+1 symbols, where N is the arity. Symbols\nrepresent application
  of between 0 to N arguments. When calling any of the\npromoted definitions it is
  important refer to it using their symbol\nname. Moreover, there is new function
  application at the type level represented\nby `Apply` type family. Symbol representing
  arity X can have X arguments passed\nin using normal function application. All other
  parameters must be passed by\ncalling `Apply`.\n\nUsers also have access to `Data.Promotion.Prelude`
  and its submodules (`Base`,\n`Bool`, `Either`, `List`, `Maybe` and `Tuple`). These
  provide promoted versions\nof function found in GHC's base library.\n\nNote that
  GHC resolves variable names in Template Haskell quotes. You cannot\nthen use an
  undefined identifier in a quote, making idioms like this not\nwork:\n```haskell\ntype
  family Foo a where ...\n$(promote [d| ... foo x ... |])\n```\nIn this example, `foo`
  would be out of scope.\n\nRefer to the promotion paper for more details on function
  promotion.\n\nClasses and instances\n---------------------\n\nThis is best understood
  by example. Let's look at a stripped down `Ord`:\n\n```haskell\nclass Eq a => Ord
  a where\n  compare :: a -> a -> Ordering\n  (<)     :: a -> a -> Bool\n  x < y =
  case x `compare` y of\n            LT -> True\n\t    EQ -> False\n\t    GT -> False\n```\n\nThis
  class gets promoted to a \"kind class\" thus:\n\n```haskell\nclass (kproxy ~ 'KProxy,
  PEq kproxy) => POrd (kproxy :: KProxy a) where\n  type Compare (x :: a) (y :: a)
  :: Ordering\n  type (:<)    (x :: a) (y :: a) :: Bool\n  type x :< y = ... -- promoting
  `case` is yucky.\n```\n\nNote that default method definitions become default associated
  type family\ninstances. This works out quite nicely.\n\nWe also get this singleton
  class:\n\n```haskell\nclass (kproxy ~ 'KProxy, SEq kproxy) => SOrd (kproxy :: KProxy
  a) where\n  sCompare :: forall (x :: a) (y :: a). Sing x -> Sing y -> Sing (Compare
  x y)\n  (%:<)    :: forall (x :: a) (y :: a). Sing x -> Sing y -> Sing (x :< y)\n\n
  \ default (%:<) :: forall (x :: a) (y :: a).\n                   ((x :< y) ~ {-
  RHS from (:<) above -})\n\t\t=> Sing x -> Sing y -> Sing (x :< y)\n  x %:< y = ...
  \ -- this is a bit yucky too\n```\n\nNote that a singletonized class needs to use
  `default` signatures, because\ntype-checking the default body requires that the
  default associated type\nfamily instance was used in the promoted class. The extra
  equality constraint\non the default signature asserts this fact to the type-checker.\n\nInstances
  work roughly similarly.\n\n```haskell\ninstance Ord Bool where\n  compare False
  False = EQ\n  compare False True  = LT\n  compare True  False = GT\n  compare True
  \ True  = EQ\n\ninstance POrd ('KProxy :: KProxy Bool) where\n  type Compare 'False
  'False = 'EQ\n  type Compare 'False 'True  = 'LT\n  type Compare 'True  'False =
  'GT\n  type Compare 'True  'True  = 'EQ\n\ninstance SOrd ('KProxy :: KProxy Bool)
  where\n  sCompare :: forall (x :: a) (y :: a). Sing x -> Sing y -> Sing (Compare
  x y)\n  sCompare SFalse SFalse = SEQ\n  sCompare SFalse STrue  = SLT\n  sCompare
  STrue  SFalse = SGT\n  sCompare STrue  STrue  = SEQ\n```\n\nThe only interesting
  bit here is the instance signature. It's not necessary\nin such a simple scenario,
  but more complicated functions need to refer to\nscoped type variables, which the
  instance signature can bring into scope.\nThe defaults all just work.\n\nOn names\n--------\n\nThe
  singletons library has to produce new names for the new constructs it\ngenerates.
  Here are some examples showing how this is done:\n\n1. original datatype: `Nat`\n\n
  \  promoted kind: `Nat`\n\n   singleton type: `SNat` (which is really a synonym
  for `Sing`)\n\n\n2. original datatype: `:/\\:`\n\n   promoted kind: `:/\\:`\n\n
  \  singleton type: `:%/\\:`\n\n\n\n3. original constructor: `Succ`\n\n   promoted
  type: `'Succ` (you can use `Succ` when unambiguous)\n\n   singleton constructor:
  `SSucc`\n\n   symbols: `SuccSym0`, `SuccSym1`\n\n\n4. original constructor: `:+:`\n\n
  \  promoted type: `':+:`\n\n   singleton constructor: `:%+:`\n\n   symbols: `:+:$`,
  `:+:$$`, `:+:$$$`\n\n\n5. original value: `pred`\n\n   promoted type: `Pred`\n\n
  \  singleton value: `sPred`\n\n   symbols: `PredSym0`, `PredSym1`\n\n\n6. original
  value: `+`\n\n   promoted type: `:+`\n\n   singleton value: `%:+`\n\n   symbols:
  `:+$`, `:+$$`, `:+$$$`\n\n\n7. original class: `Num`\n\n   promoted class: `PNum`\n\n
  \  singleton class: `SNum`\n\n\n8. original class: `~>`\n\n   promoted class: `#~>`\n\n
  \  singleton class: `:%~>`\n\n\nSpecial names\n-------------\n\nThere are some special
  cases:\n\n1. original datatype: `[]`\n\n   singleton type: `SList`\n\n\n2.  original
  constructor: `[]`\n\n    promoted type: `'[]`\n\n    singleton constructor: `SNil`\n\n
  \   symbols: `NilSym0`\n\n\n3. original constructor: `:`\n\n   promoted type: `':`\n\n
  \  singleton constructr: `SCons`\n\n   symbols: `ConsSym0`, `ConsSym1`\n\n\n4. original
  datatype: `(,)`\n\n   singleton type: `STuple2`\n\n\n5. original constructor: `(,)`\n\n
  \  promoted type: `'(,)`\n\n   singleton constructor: `STuple2`\n\n   symbols: `Tuple2Sym0`,
  `Tuple2Sym1`, `Tuple2Sym2`\n\n   All tuples (including the 0-tuple, unit) are treated
  similarly.\n\n6. original value: `undefined`\n\n   promoted type: `Any`\n\n   singleton
  value: `undefined`\n\n\nSupported Haskell constructs\n----------------------------\n\nThe
  following constructs are fully supported:\n\n* variables\n* tuples\n* constructors\n*
  if statements\n* infix expressions\n* `_` patterns\n* aliased patterns\n* lists\n*
  sections\n* undefined\n* error\n* deriving `Eq`, `Ord`, `Bounded`, and `Enum`\n*
  class constraints (though these sometimes fail with `let`, `lambda`, and `case`)\n*
  literals (for `Nat` and `Symbol`), including overloaded number literals\n* unboxed
  tuples (which are treated as normal tuples)\n* records\n* pattern guards\n* case\n*
  let\n* lambda expressions\n* `!` and `~` patterns (silently but successfully ignored
  during promotion)\n* class and instance declarations\n* functional dependencies
  (with limitations -- see below)\n\nThe following constructs are supported for promotion
  but not singleton generation:\n\n* scoped type variables\n* overlapping patterns.
  Note that overlapping patterns are\n  sometimes not obvious. For example, the `filter`
  function does not\n  singletonize due\n  to overlapping patterns:\n```haskell\nfilter
  :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]\nfilter _pred []    = []\nfilter pred (x:xs)\n  | pred
  x         = x : filter pred xs\n  | otherwise      = filter pred xs\n```\nOverlap
  is caused by `otherwise` catch-all guard, that is always true and this\noverlaps
  with `pred x` guard.\n\nThe following constructs are not supported:\n\n* list comprehensions\n*
  do\n* arithmetic sequences\n* datatypes that store arrows, `Nat`, or `Symbol`\n*
  literals (limited support)\n\nWhy are these out of reach? First two depend on monads,
  which mention a\nhigher-kinded type variable. GHC does not support higher-sorted
  kind variables,\nwhich would be necessary to promote/singletonize monads. There
  are other tricks\npossible, too, but none are likely to work. See the bug report\n[here](https://github.com/goldfirere/singletons/issues/37)
  for more info.\nArithmetic sequences are defined using `Enum` typeclass, which uses
  infinite\nlists.\n\nAs described in the promotion paper, promotion of datatypes
  that store arrows is\ncurrently impossible. So if you have a declaration such as\n\n
  \   data Foo = Bar (Bool -> Maybe Bool)\n\nyou will quickly run into errors.\n\nLiterals
  are problematic because we rely on GHC's built-in support, which\ncurrently is limited.
  Functions that operate on strings will not work because\ntype level strings are
  no longer considered lists of characters. Function\nworking on integer literals
  can be promoted by rewriting them to use\n`Nat`. Since `Nat` does not exist at the
  term level it will only be possible to\nuse the promoted definition, but not the
  original, term-level one.\n\nThis is the same line of reasoning that forbids the
  use of `Nat` or `Symbol`\nin datatype definitions. But, see [this bug\nreport](https://github.com/goldfirere/singletons/issues/76)
  for a workaround.\n\nSupport for `*`\n---------------\n\nThe built-in Haskell promotion
  mechanism does not yet have a full story around\nthe kind `*` (the kind of types
  that have values). Ideally, promoting some form\nof `TypeRep` would yield `*`, but
  the implementation of TypeRep would have to be\nupdated for this to really work
  out. In the meantime, users who wish to\nexperiment with this feature have two options:\n\n1)
  The module `Data.Singletons.TypeRepStar` has all the definitions possible for\nmaking
  `*` the promoted version of `TypeRep`, as `TypeRep` is currently implemented.\nThe
  singleton associated with `TypeRep` has one constructor:\n\n    data instance Sing
  (a :: *) where\n      STypeRep :: Typeable a => Sing a\n\nThus, an implicit `TypeRep`
  is stored in the singleton constructor. However,\nany datatypes that store `TypeRep`s
  will not generally work as expected; the\nbuilt-in promotion mechanism will not
  promote `TypeRep` to `*`.\n\n2) The module `Data.Singletons.CustomStar` allows the
  programmer to define a subset\nof types with which to work. See the Haddock documentation
  for the function\n`singletonStar` for more info.\n\nKnown bugs\n----------\n\n*
  Record updates don't singletonize\n* In obscure scenarios, GHC \"forgets\" constraints
  on functions. This should\n  happen only with certain uses where the constraint
  is needed inside of a\n  `case` or lambda-expression. Having type inference on result
  types nearby\n  makes this more likely to bite.\n* Inference dependent on functional
  dependencies is unpredictably bad. The\n  problem is that a use of an associated
  type family tied to a class with\n  fundeps doesn't provoke the fundep to kick in.
  This is GHC's problem, in\n  the end.\n"
