  Changelog for the `singletons-th` project
  =========================================

  3.3 [2023.10.13]
  ----------------
  * Require building with GHC 9.8.
  * Singled data types with derived `Eq` or `Ord` instances now generate `Eq` or
    `Ord` instances for the singleton type itself, e.g.,

    ```hs
    instance Eq (SExample a) where
      _ == _ = True

    instance Ord (SExample a) where
      compare _ _ = EQ
    ```
  * `singletons-th` now makes an effort to promote definitions that use scoped
    type variables. See the "Scoped type variables" section of the `README` for
    more information about what `singletons-th` can (and can't) do.
  * `singletons-th` now supports singling type-level definitions that use
    `TypeAbstractions`.
  * Fix a bug in which data types using visible dependent quantification would
    generate ill-scoped code when singled.
  * Fix a bug in which singling a local variable that shadows a top-level
    definition would fail to typecheck in some circumstances.
  * Fix a bug in which `singletons-th` would incorrectly promote/single records
    to top-level field selectors when `NoFieldSelectors` was active.

  3.2 [2023.03.12]
  ----------------
  * Require building with GHC 9.6.
  * Derived `POrd` and `SOrd` instances (arising from a use of `deriving Ord`)
    now use `(<>) @Ordering` in their implementations instead of the custom
    `thenCmp :: Ordering -> Ordering -> Ordering` function. While most code will
    likely continue to work after this change, this may break code that attempts
    to prove properties about the implementation of a derived `POrd`/`SOrd`
    instance.
  * Fix a bug in which the `singDecideInstances` and `showSingInstances`, as well
    as `deriving Show` declarations, would not respect custom
    `promotedDataTypeOrConName` options.
  * Allow building with `mtl-2.3.*`.

  3.1.1 [2022.08.23]
  ------------------
  * Require building with GHC 9.4.
  * Improve error messages when attempting to promote a partial application of
    a function arrow `(->)`, which is not currently supported.

  3.1 [2021.10.30]
  ----------------
  * Require building with GHC 9.2.
  * Allow promoting and singling type applications in data constructor patterns.
  * Make the Template Haskell machinery generate `SingI1` and `SingI2` instances
    when possible.
  * Make `genDefunSymbols` and related functions less likely to trigger
    [GHC#19743](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/19743).

  3.0 [2021.03.12]
  ----------------
  * The `singletons` library has been split into three libraries:

    * The new `singletons` library is now a minimal library that only provides
      `Data.Singletons`, `Data.Singletons.Decide`, `Data.Singletons.Sigma`, and
      `Data.Singletons.ShowSing` (if compiled with GHC 8.6 or later).
      `singletons` now supports building GHCs back to GHC 8.0, as well as GHCJS.
    * The `singletons-th` library defines Template Haskell functionality for
      promoting and singling term-level definitions, but but nothing else. This
      library continues to require the latest stable release of GHC.
    * The `singletons-base` library defines promoted and singled versions of
      definitions from the `base` library, including the `Prelude`. This library
      continues to require the latest stable release of GHC.

    Consult the changelogs for `singletons` and `singletons-base` for changes
    specific to those libraries. For more information on this split, see the
    [relevant GitHub discussion](https://github.com/goldfirere/singletons/issues/420).
  * Require building with GHC 9.0.
  * `Data.Singletons.CustomStar` and `Data.Singletons.SuppressUnusedWarnings`
    have been renamed to `Data.Singletons.TH.CustomStar` and
    `Data.Singletons.SuppressUnusedWarnings`, respectively, to give every module
    in `singletons-th` a consistent module prefix.
  * Due to the `singletons` package split, the `singletons-th` modules
    `Data.Singletons.TH` and `Data.Singletons.TH.CustomStar` (formerly known as
    `Data.Singletons.CustomStar`) no longer re-export any definitions from the
    `singletons-base` module `Prelude.Singletons` (formerly known as
    `Data.Singletons.Prelude`). The `singletons-base` library now provides
    versions of these modules—`Data.Singletons.Base.CustomStar` and
    `Data.Singletons.Base.TH`, respectively—that do re-export definitions
    from `Prelude.Singletons`.
  * "Fully saturated" defunctionalization symbols (e.g., `IdSym1`) are now
    defined as type families instead of type synonyms. This has two notable
    benefits:

    * Fully saturated defunctionalization symbols can now be given standalone
      kind signatures, which ensures that the order of kind variables is the
      same as the user originally declared them.
    * This fixes a minor regression in `singletons-2.7` in which the quality
      of `:kind!` output in GHCi would become worse when using promoted type
      families generated by Template Haskell.

    Under certain circumstances, this can be a breaking change:

    * Since more TH-generated promoted functions now have type families on
      their right-hand sides, some programs will now require
      `UndecidableInstances` where they didn't before.
    * Certain definitions that made use of overlapping patterns, such as
      `natMinus` below, will no longer typecheck:

      ```hs
      $(singletons [d|
        data Nat = Z | S Nat

        natMinus :: Nat -> Nat -> Nat
        natMinus Z     _     = Z
        natMinus (S a) (S b) = natMinus a b
        natMinus a     Z     = a
        |])
      ```

      This can be worked around by avoiding the use of overlapping patterns.
      In the case of `natMinus`, this amounts to changing the third equation
      to match on its first argument:

      ```hs
      $(singletons [d|
        natMinus :: Nat -> Nat -> Nat
        natMinus Z       _     = Z
        natMinus (S a)   (S b) = natMinus a b
        natMinus a@(S _) Z     = a
        |])
      ```
  * The specification for how `singletons` deals with record selectors has been
    simplified. Previously, `singletons` would try to avoid promoting so-called
    "naughty" selectors (those whose types mention existential type variables
    that do not appear in the constructor's return type) to top-level functions.
    Determing if a selector is naughty is quite challenging in practice, as
    determining if a type variable is existential or not in the context of
    Template Haskell is difficult in the general case. As a result, `singletons`
    now adopts the dumb-but-predictable approach of always promoting record
    selectors to top-level functions, naughty or not.

    This means that attempting to promote code with a naughty record selector,
    like in the example below, will no longer work:

    ```hs
    $(promote [d|
      data Some :: (Type -> Type) -> Type where
        MkSome :: { getSome :: f a } -> Some f
        -- getSome is naughty due to mentioning the type variable `a`
      |])
    ```

    Please open an issue if you find this restriction burdensome in practice.
  * The `singEqInstanceOnly` and `singEqInstancesOnly` functions, which generate
    `SEq` (but not `PEq`) instances, have been removed. There is not much point
    in keeping these functions around now that `PEq` now longer has a special
    default implementation. Use `singEqInstance{s}` instead.
  * The Template Haskell machinery will no longer promote `TypeRep` to `Type`,
    as this special case never worked properly in the first place.
  * The Template Haskell machinery will now preserve strict fields in data types
    when generating their singled counterparts.
  * Introduce a new `promotedDataTypeOrConName` option to
    `Data.Singletons.TH.Options`. Overriding this option can be useful in
    situations where one wishes to promote types such as `Nat`, `Symbol`, or
    data types built on top of them. See the
    "Arrows, `Nat`, `Symbol`, and literals" section of the `README` for more
    information.
  * Define a `Quote` instance for `OptionsM`. A notable benefit of this instance
    is that it avoids the need to explicitly `lift` TH quotes into `OptionsM`.
    Before, you would have to do this:

    ```hs
    import Control.Monad.Trans.Class (lift)

    withOptions defaultOptions
      $ singletons
      $ lift [d| data T = MkT |]
    ```

    But now, it suffices to simply do this:

    ```hs
    withOptions defaultOptions
      $ singletons [d| data T = MkT |]
    ```

  `singletons-th`
  ===============

  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/singletons-th.svg)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/singletons-th)

  `singletons-th` defines Template Haskell functionality that allows
  _promotion_ of term-level functions to type-level equivalents and
  _singling_ functions to dependently typed equivalents. This library was
  originally presented in
  [_Dependently Typed Programming with Singletons_](https://richarde.dev/papers/2012/singletons/paper.pdf),
  published at the Haskell Symposium, 2012. See also
  [the paper published at Haskell Symposium, 2014](https://richarde.dev/papers/2014/promotion/promotion.pdf),
  which describes how promotion works in greater detail.

  `singletons-th` generates code that relies on bleeding-edge GHC language
  extensions. As such, `singletons-th` only supports the latest major version
  of GHC (currently GHC 9.8). For more information,
  consult the `singletons`
  [`README`](https://github.com/goldfirere/singletons/blob/master/README.md).

  You may also be interested in the following related libraries:

  * The `singletons` library is a small, foundational library that defines
    basic singleton-related types and definitions.
  * The `singletons-base` library uses `singletons-th` to define promoted and
    singled functions from the `base` library, including the `Prelude`.
