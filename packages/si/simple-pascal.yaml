description: |-
  This package provides a compiler for simplified variant of Pascal language.
  That language includes conditional statements, for loops, procedures and
  functions. But it does not support complex data types (only integer, string
  and boolean are supported currently).
  This compiler outputs bytecode which may be run by SSVM (see simple-stacked-vm
  package).
