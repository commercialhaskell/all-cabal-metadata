  # silently

  Silently is a package that allows you to run an `IO` action and
  prevent it from writing to `stdout`, or any other handle, by using
  `silence`. Or you can capture the output for yourself using `capture`.

  For example, the program
  ```haskell
   import System.IO.Silently

   main = do
     putStr "putStrLn: " >> putStrLn "puppies!"
     putStr "silenced: " >> silence (putStrLn "kittens!")
     putStrLn ""
     (captured, result) <- capture (putStr "wookies!" >> return 123)
     putStr "captured: " >> putStrLn captured
     putStr "returned: " >> putStrLn (show result)
  ```
  will print:
  ```
   putStrLn: puppies!
   silenced:
   captured: wookies!
   returned: 123
  ```

  ## Limitations

  Capturing/silencing might not work as expected if the action uses the FFI
  or conceals output under `unsafePerformIO` or similar unsafe operations.

  Examples:
  - FFI: https://github.com/hspec/silently/issues/3
  - `unsafePerformIO`: https://github.com/bos/filemanip/issues/22
