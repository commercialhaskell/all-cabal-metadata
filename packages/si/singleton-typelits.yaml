description: ! 'Singletons and induction schemes over ''GHC.TypeLits.Nat''.


  While the TypeLits interface provided by GHC does allow case-analysing the

  values of the naturals (''GHC.TypeLits.natVal''), it does not facilitate writing

  type-safe programs involving that AP, if one were to write:


  > case natVal (x :: Proxy n) of 0 -> foo x


  In the RHS of this pattern match @n@ is equal to @0@ but this isn''t something

  GHC can reason about, as this is an ordinary pattern match on an ''Integer''.

  If the type of @foo@ was @Proxy 0 -> ...@ this wouldn''t typecheck and one

  would have to resort to @unsafeCoerce@. In order to make GHC infer something

  like this, @natVal@ needs to return a GADT that includes proofs about the

  natural number it refers to, such that when pattern matching on that GADT the

  proofs become available to the typechecker.


  This package provides a handful of variants of such GADTs for overcoming this

  type of issue, as well as functions to do typesafe induction on naturals

  without resorting to manual GADT unpacking. The most basic form of induction -

  Peano-style induction (P(0) and P(n) implies P(n + 1)) can be inefficient in

  practice on large numbers, so this package also provides more efficient binary

  and arbitrary-base induction schemes.'
