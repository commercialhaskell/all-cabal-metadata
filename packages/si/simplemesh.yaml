  # simplemesh

  Utility functions for the generation of primitive meshes, similar to Rust's [genmesh](https://github.com/gfx-rs/genmesh).
  Ideally, I want to be able to unify shapes in gloss and apecs-physics, but for now, this is just a collection of functions that I find myself writing a lot.
  If you know of a more formal library (or have ideas on how to make this one more formal), let me know.
  If you _don't_ know of another library and want me to push this one to Hackage, also let me know.

  ```
  > vertices (rectangle 2 3)
  [ V2 0.0 0.0, V2 0.0 3.0, V2 2.0 3.0, V2 2.0 0.0 ]

  > edges (centeredRectangle 2 3)
  [ (V2 (-1.0) (-1.5), V2 (-1.0) 1.5)
  , (V2 (-1.0) 1.5, V2 1.0 1.5)
  , (V2 1.0 1.5, V2 1.0 (-1.5))
  , (V2 1.0 (-1.5), V2 (-1.0) (-1.5)) ]
  ```
