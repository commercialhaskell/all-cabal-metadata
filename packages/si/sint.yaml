  # sint

  A singleton type for `Nat` represented as `Int`.

  This package implements a type `SInt` that links a runtime `Int` with a
  type-level `Nat`, along with some arithmetic and reflection capabilities.

  This is useful when mixing type-level `Nat`s with GHC array primitives that
  expect `Int`s as sizes and indices.

  See the module intro of `Data.SInt` for more details.
