  Rounding rationals to significant digits and decimal places.

  The 'round' function from the prelude returns an integer. The standard librarys
  of C and C++ have round functions that return floating point numbers. Rounding
  in this library takes and returns 'Rational's and can round to a number of
  significant digits or a number of decimal places.
