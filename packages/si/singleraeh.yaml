  # singleraeh
  Explicit singletons. More manual than `singletons`, but potentially easier to
  use because you can give GHC more explicit information (compared to `singletons`
  which often threads things through the `Sing` type family and `SingI` type
  class).

  Uses phadej's `defun` package for defunctionalizing type families. (Edit,
  actually doesn't require `defun` just yet. But I think that's just because I
  haven't bothered defunctionalizing things.)

  Requires GHC >= 9.6 for the builtin `SNat`, `SSymbol` etc. singletons.
