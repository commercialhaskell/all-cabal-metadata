  # Revision history for significant-figures

  ## 0.2.0.0 -- 2022-09-22

  * **BREAKING** Rename `Leaf` to `Literal`.
  * **BREAKING** Parser parses expressions for both base and exponent in
    exponentiation. The evaluation step is now the step that errors when the
    exponent is not an integer. This allows support for more valid expressions.
  * added pretty printing module, used in property-testing

  ## 0.1.0.1 -- 2022-09-06

  * Add README to front page

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2022-09-05

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  # Significant Figures

  This repository contains the `Data.SigFig` module that contains a variety of
  functions to parse and evaluate expressions involving significant figures. It
  also contains an executable CLI using Haskeline.

  ## Supported Operations

  | Operation | Example | Output |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | addition | `2.0 + 4.31` | `6.3` |
  | subtraction | `5.1 - 2` | `3` |
  | multiplication | `4.8 * 5.2` | `25` |
  | division | `4.00 / 3.1` | `1.3` |
  | constants | `2c * 4.2` | `8.4` |
  | logarithms | `log(10)` | `1.0` |
  | antilogarithms | `exp(6.24)` | `1.7 x 10^6` |
  | exponentiation | `4.0 ** 4` | `2.6 x 10^2` |

  > I created the distinction between antilogarithm and exponentiation to
  > distinguish between which value is measured and which is constant. You'd use
  > an antilogarithm, for instance, to calculate the molarity of H3O+ given pH,
  > whereas exponentiation is nothing more than a shorthand for repeated
  > multiplication.

  For the rules regarding significant figures, [→ see here](http://cxp.cengage.com/contentservice/assets/owms01h/references/significantfigures/index.html).

  Of course, you can use parentheses and more complex expressions:

  ```
  expr> log(10.45) * 100c + 3.6200 * (9.4523 + 876.45) / 2c
  1705.4 (5 s.f.)
  ```

  Support for general arbitrary-precision arithmetic on the rationals:
  ```
  expr> 4.52c * 100c * (1c/60c)
  113/15 (non-terminating const)
  ```

  Super-smart display that shows scientific notation when necessary, and
  annotation for significant figures:
  ```
  expr> 0.650 * 4000.
  2.60 x 10^3 (3 s.f.)
  ```

  ## Manipulation of Expressions and Terms

  The `Data.SigFig.Types` module contains some functions to help with
  manipulating terms and expressions in Haskell, allowing one to skip the process
  of parsing.

  ## Reminders

  - Significant figures are **correctly calculated by postponing rounding until the
    end of a sequence of similar operations**; i.e., rounding to least decimal
    place only occurs after all addition/subtraction operations in a row are
    computed. Internally, this is done by parsing such runs as a list of operands
    and associated operations instead of treating operators as binary.

  - Functions that return irrational numbers do not work when given a constant
    value as input, since constants are represented internally as rationals, and
    therefore the essence of a "constant" in the context of significant figures
    (i.e., "infinite" significant figures") cannot be guaranteed. Since using a
    symbolic math engine is complete overkill for such a calculator, we limit the
    domain of these functions. **NOTE:** This doesn't mean you can't use
    constants within the argument expression, it just means the expression must
    not _evaluate_ to a constant. For example, with the `log()` function,
    `log(45c + 2)` (`log(47)`) is perfectly fine, but `log(45c + 2c)` (`log(47c)`)
    is not.

  - Zero is a weird number for significant figures. First, [→ no measurement
    should _ever_ be recorded as
    0](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2149316/how-many-significant-figures-in-0-0),
    or 0.0, or 0.00 or 0.0e2 or anything like that, since significant figures
    work on relative precision and that breaks down once you just have 0. But
    that's not the end of the story. Consider a case where you take a difference
    of two measurements and end up with 0, or really any situation in which you
    end up with 0 as an intermediate/final result. In this case, you _do_ have a
    good idea of what precision you have, but it becomes incredibly difficult to
    work since all notion of _significant decimal places_ is lost. Furthermore,
    you may think of a workaround, in which `0.000` and `000.0` (alternatively
    written `0.000 x 10^2`) as _distinct_ values in the context of significant
    figures. The below doesn't feel right to me:

    `exp(000.0) = 10 ^ (100c * 0.000) = 1`

    `exp(0.000) = 10 ^ (1c * 0.000) = 1.00`

    A patch that resolves this will involve storing another piece of metadata for
    each value: its rightmost (or leftmost, given the total number of significant
    figures) significant decimal place.

    Since I have concluded there is no trivial general solution to this, I
    have chosen to retain the number of significant figures for 0-values, such
    that they work as expected in larger expressions. Also, this is an incredibly
    niche case that should not ever appear in well-designed lab procedures.

    TL;DR: How zeroes work is pretty controversial but it should work the way
    you'd expect them to intuitively (I asked other people how they'd expect
    zeroes to work and it was the way it currently is).
