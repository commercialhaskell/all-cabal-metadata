description: ! '# An interface to the Silicon Labs Si5351 clock chip


  ![Si5351 Board](https://i.imgur.com/5DI1b1l.jpg)


  The Si5351 is Silicon Labs I2C-programmable any-frequency CMOS clock generator and
  VCXO.

  It can generate any frequency from ca 8kHz to 160MHz.

  The Si5351 uses a programmable rational clock divider.


  ## Why yet an other SI5351 library ?


  First of all it is hackable in Haskell.

  And second, almost all of the other open source Si5351 libraries

  use a fixed denominator for the clock divider.

  In other words, 20 of the 58 bits, that set the clock divider, are hard-coded in

  library.

  As the IC always uses a combination of two rational divider stages,

  a total of 2*20 bits = 40 bits, that the carefully designed hardware provides,

  are lost by the software design.

  That means "40 bits less resolution and more jitter".


  Instead of a fixed denominator, this library uses

  [continued fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction)

  to compute the (theoretically best)

  numerator-denominator pair for the clock divider.

  (TO DO investigate if this makes any difference in practice.)


  ## Examples

  The library contains examples for:


  * Frequency synthesis

  * Hopping frequencies

  * CW generation (Morse code)

  * Transmitting JT65

  * RTTY / FSK
