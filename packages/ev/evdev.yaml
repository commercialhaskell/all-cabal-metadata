  # Revision history for evdev

  ## 2.3.1 -- 01-09-2023
  * Migrate to `unix-2.8`.

  ## 2.3.0 -- 01-09-2023
  * Add `deviceOptsFromEvents` for more easily creating UInput devices with desired capabilities.
  * Add some extra `Read` instances.
  * Fix duplicate keys by using pattern synonyms.

  ## 2.2.0 -- 05-11-2022
  * More bindings:
      * `deviceAbsAxis`
      * `REL_WHEEL_HI_RES` and `REL_HWHEEL_HI_RES`
      * `setDeviceLED`
  * Open devices with write permissions by default. This is primarily in order to make `setDeviceLED` easier to use.
  * Export event types from `Uinput` module. This means that that module can actually reasonably be used without also importing `Evdev` and selectively hiding things.
  * Wrap results of `deviceUniq` and `devicePhys` in `Maybe`, to avoid possibly dereferencing null pointers.

  ## 2.1.0 -- 2021-02-12
  * Add `Evdev.Uinput` module, for creating virtual devices.
  * More functions for querying device properties.
  * Remove some invalid instances for `EventCode` and `EventValue`.
  * Make it possible for user to create a device from a specified file descriptor.
      * Opens up non-blocking IO, amongst other possibilities.

  ## 2.0.0.0 -- 2020-05-30
  * This is really what should have been the `1.0` release, had I had a better understanding of the PVP when starting off.
  * Split Streamly integration into a separate package, `evdev-streamly`.
  * Safety improvements - `UnknownEvent` is used to handle a number of what were previously potential crashes.
  * Lots of other, minor improvements, including simplifying the API in places, and exposing lower-level functionality where it is likely to be useful.

  ## 1.3.0.0 -- 2020-03-03
  * Fix memory management issues and file descriptor leaks.
  * Rename 'ReadFlags' to 'ReadFlag' as the type clearly represents just one flag.

  ## 1.2.0.0 -- 2019-12-19
  * Add `newDevices` stream.
  * More robust error handling when reading from multiple devices.

  ## 1.1.0.1 -- 2019-12-18
  * Add `pkgconfig-depends` field to cabal file.

  ## 1.1.0.0 -- 2019-12-16
  * Hide LowLevel.

  ## 1.0.0.0 -- 2019-12-15
  * First stable release.

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2019-07-20
  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  Evdev
  =====

  This library provides access to the Linux [evdev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evdev) interface, for reading input events from devices. It uses [c2hs](https://github.com/haskell/c2hs/wiki/User-Guide)-generated bindings to [libevdev](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/libevdev/), which should be available on almost any modern Linux distro.

  It aims to expose the full set of functionality exposed by `libevdev`, while providing stronger types, and a higher level of abstraction - no worrying about memory management, ordering of operations etc.

  For a higher-level, more functional API based on event streams, see [evdev-streamly](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/evdev-streamly).

  This package uses `ByteString`s (a.k.a `RawFilePath`s) ubiquitously. You may want to substitute use of packages like `filepath`, `directory`, `unix` and `process` with `ByteString`-friendly alternatives:
  - [rawfilepath](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rawfilepath)
  - [filepath-bytestring](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/filepath-bytestring)

  # Permissions

  Your user will need to be a member of the `input` group in order to read from devices. Try `usermod -a -G input $USER`.

  To create virtual devices (i.e. to use the `Evdev.UInput` module) you will need permission to write to `/dev/uinput`. This can usually be achieved by creating a group specially for uinput permissions:
  ```
  sudo groupadd uinput
  sudo usermod -a -G uinput $USER
  echo 'KERNEL=="uinput", GROUP="uinput", MODE:="0660", OPTIONS+="static_node=uinput"' | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/99-uinput.rules > /dev/null
  ```
  Log out and back in for this to take effect (or try `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger`).
