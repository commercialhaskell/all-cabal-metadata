  EventStore Haskell TCP client
  =============================

  [Talk and exchange ideas in our dedicated Discord Server]

  That driver supports 100% of EventStore features !
  More information about the GetEventStore database can be found there: https://eventstore.org/

  Requirements
  ============
    * 64bits system
    * GHC        >= 8.0.3
    * Cabal      >= 1.18
    * EventStore >= 4

  *Note: If you use this client version >= to `1.1`, it will only supports EventStore >= 4.0.0.*

  Install
  =======

  * Using [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/eventstore)
  ```
  $ cabal update
  $ cabal install eventstore
  ```

  * From source
  ```
  $ git clone https://gitlab.com/YoEight/eventstore-hs.git
  $ cd eventstore
  $ cabal install --only-dependencies
  $ cabal configure
  $ cabal install
  ```

  How to test
  ===========
  Tests are available. Those assume a server is running on `127.0.0.1` and `1113` port.
  ```
  $ cabal install --only-dependencies --enable-tests
  $ cabal configure --enable-tests
  $ cabal test
  ```

  How to use
  ==========

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-} -- That library uses `Text` pervasively. This pragma permits to use
                                     -- String literal when a Text is needed.
  module Main where

  import Control.Concurrent.Async (wait)
  import Data.Aeson
  -- It requires to have `aeson` package installed. Note that EventStore doesn't constraint you to JSON
  -- format but putting common use aside, by doing so you'll be able to use some interesting EventStore
  -- features like its Complex Event Processing (CEP) capabality.

  import Database.EventStore
  -- Note that imports 'NonEmpty' data constructor and 'nonEmpty' function from
  -- 'Data.List.NonEmpty'.

  main :: IO ()
  main = do
      -- A common pattern with an EventStore connection is to create a single instance only and pass it
      -- wherever you need it (it's threadsafe). It's very important to not consider an EventStore connection like
      -- its regular SQL counterpart. An EventStore connection will try its best to reconnect
      -- automatically to the server if the connection dropped. Of course that behavior can be tuned
      -- through some settings.
      conn <- connect defaultSettings (Static "127.0.0.1" 1113)
      let js  = object ["isHaskellTheBest" .= True] -- (.=) comes from Data.Aeson module.
          evt = createEvent "programming" Nothing (withJson js)

      -- Appends an event to a stream named `languages`.
      as <- sendEvent conn (StreamName "languages") anyVersion evt Nothing

      -- EventStore interactions are fundamentally asynchronous. Nothing requires you to wait
      -- for the completion of an operation, but it's good to know if something went wrong.
      _ <- wait as

      -- Again, if you decide to `shutdown` an EventStore connection, it means your application is
      -- about to terminate.
      shutdown conn

      -- Make sure the EventStore connection completes every ongoing operation. For instance, if
      -- at the moment we call `shutdown` and some operations (or subscriptions) were still pending,
      -- the connection aborted all of them.
      waitTillClosed conn
  ```
  Notes
  =====
  That library was tested on Linux and OSX.
