synopsis: Visualise an eventlog
changelog: |
  0.3, released 2019-09-08

  * Added warnings if eventlog2html is used on eventlogs generated by GHC Version without profiling support.
  * Moved to version 0.4 of HVega.
  * HeapProfCostCentre and HeapProfSampleCostCentre Events are included  in the generated output.

  0.2, released 2019-07-05

  * Added the commandline option '-o OUTFILE' which writes the output to
    the given filename.
  * Show the time the eventlog was created in the generated HTML output.

  0.1, released 2019-06-23

  * Initial release, a complete rewrite on hp2pretty. Implemented by
    Matthew Pickering and David Binder.

  # eventlog2html

  [Interactive Documentation](https://mpickering.github.io/eventlog2html/)

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mpickering/eventlog2html.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mpickering/eventlog2html)
  ![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/eventlog2html.svg)

  `eventlog2html` is a tool to visualise eventlogs. In particular, it creates
  interactive charts for the heap profiling information included in the
  eventlog.

  The [complete documentation](https://mpickering.github.io/eventlog2html/) contain
  [interactive](https://mpickering.github.io/eventlog2html/examples/ghc.eventlog.html) [examples](https://mpickering.github.io/eventlog2html/examples/eventlog2html.eventlog.html) and complete usage information.

  ## How to use

  The tool produces a static webpage to visualise the heap profile.
  For an eventlog `program.eventlog`, a static page titled `program.eventlog.html`
  will be created adjacent to the original file.

  In order to use `eventlog2html` you first need an eventlog with heap profiling
  samples.

  Compile your program with `-prof`. In a cabal project, the easiest way to
  do this is to set `profiling: True` in the `cabal.project` file.

  Then, run your program with the normal profiling flags with an additional `-l`
  flag. This will tell GHC to also emit the eventlog.

  ```
  my-leaky-program +RTS -hy -l-au
  ```

  In the current directory a file `my-leaky-program.eventlog` will be produced.
  This is what you need to pass to `eventlog2html` to generate the profiling
  graphs.

  ```
  eventlog2html my-leaky-program.eventlog
  ```

  Note: The `-l-au` suffix will result in a significantly smaller eventlog
  as it will not include thread events. This makes a big difference for
  multi-threaded applications.

  ## Building the project

  There are two supported ways to build the project: `cabal new-build` and `nix`.
  For development the normal `cabal new-build` workflow should work fine.

  There are also nix files provided which can build both the tool and documentation.
  Binary caches are populated by CI.

  ```
  cachix use mpickering
  nix build -f . eventlog2html
  nix build -f . site
  ```

  Using `nix` means that you can conveniently try the project using

  ```
  nix run -f https://github.com/mpickering/eventlog2html/archive/master.tar.gz eventlog2html -c eventlog2html my-leaky-program.eventlog
  ```

  ## Fixing CI

  If we need a newer version of a dependency then it might be necessary to update
  the `index-state` which `haskell.nix` uses to compute the build plan.

  All this requires is updating the date in `build.nix` to something more recent.
  The `index-state-hashes` are updated once a day so you might have to choose a
  date from a few days ago rather than the current date.

  ## Modifying Documentation

  The documentation for the project is located in the `docs` folder. It is a hakyll
  site built by the generator in the `hakyll-eventlog` folder. CI automatically
  builds and deploys changes to the documentation.

  Additional examples can be added by adding an eventlog to the `examples`
  subdirectory. They will automatically be added to the examples gallery.

  You can build the documentation using the `nix` target or using `cabal
  new-build hakyll-eventlog` and invoking the resulting executable in the `docs/`
  directory.

  There is a custom pandoc filter which can insert rendered eventlogs into the
  documentation. To understand how this works it's probably easiest to read the code
  or copy the existing examples.
