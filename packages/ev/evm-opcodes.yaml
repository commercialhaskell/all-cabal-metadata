  # evm-opcodes

  [![Haskell CI Status](https://github.com/sshine/evm-opcodes/workflows/Haskell%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sshine/evm-opcodes/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Haskell+CI%22)

  This Haskell library provides opcode types for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

  The library has two purposes:

   - Provide interface between EVM-related libraries: Lower cost of interoperability.
   - Provide easy access to labelled jumps. Labelled jumps are most useful when
     generating EVM code, but actual EVM `jump` instructions pop the destination
     address from the stack.

  The library has one parameterised type, `Opcode' j` where `j` is the annotation
  for the jump-related instructions `JUMP`, `JUMPI` and `JUMPDEST`, and it has
  three concrete variants:

   - `type Opcode = Opcode' ()`
   - `type PositionalOpcode = Opcode' Word`
   - `type LabelledOpcode = Opcode' Text`

  The library has a fixpoint algorithm that translates labelled jumps into
  positional jumps, and it has another function that translates those positional
  jumps into plain EVM opcodes where a constant is pushed before a jump is made.

  ## Library conventions

  When the documentation refers to a lowercase opcode (e.g. `push1`), then that
  means the EVM opcode. When the documentation instead refers to an uppercase
  opcode (e.g. `PUSH`), then that refers to the Haskell data constructor.

  While `dup1`-`dup16`, `swap1`-`swap16` and `log1`-`log4` were implemented using
  the data constructors `DUP`, `SWAP` and `LOG` that are not ergonomic to use but
  convenient for the library maintainer, pattern synonyms were made:

   - `DUP1`, `DUP2`, ..., `DUP16`
   - `SWAP1`, `SWAP2`, ..., `SWAP16`
   - `LOG1`, `LOG2`, `LOG3`, `LOG4`

  When pushing a constant to the stack, EVM uses `push1`, `push2`, ..., `push32`
  where the number 1-32 refers to how many bytes the constant occupies. Instead
  of having 32 unique push commands, this library has a single `PUSH !Word256`
  constructor that serializes to the right `push1`, `push2`, etc.

  ## Example

  Imagine translating the following C program to EVM opcodes:

  ```
  int x = 1;
  while (x != 0) { x *= 2 };
  ```

  Since EVM is stack-based, let's put `x` on the stack.

  ```haskell
  λ> import EVM.Opcode
  λ> import EVM.Opcode.Labelled as L
  λ> import EVM.Opcode.Positional as P

  λ> let opcodes = [PUSH 1,JUMPDEST "loop",DUP1,ISZERO,JUMPI "end",PUSH 2,MUL,JUMP "loop",JUMPDEST "end"]

  λ> L.translate opcodes
  Right [PUSH 1,JUMPDEST 2,DUP1,ISZERO,JUMPI 14,PUSH 2,MUL,JUMP 2,JUMPDEST 14]

  λ> P.translate <$> L.translate opcodes
  Right [PUSH 1,JUMPDEST,DUP1,ISZERO,PUSH 14,JUMPI,PUSH 2,MUL,PUSH 2,JUMP,JUMPDEST]

  λ> fmap opcodeText . P.translate <$> L.translate opcodes
  Right ["push1 1","jumpdest","dup1","iszero","push1 14","jumpi","push1 2","mul","push1 2","jump","jumpdest"]
  ```

  ## Accounts for size of `PUSH`es when doing absolute jumps

  EVM's `jump` and `jumpi` instructions are parameterless. Instead they pop and
  jump to the address on the top of the stack. In order to perform absolute jumps
  in the code, it is necessary to `PUSH` an address on the stack first.  This is
  inconvenient, and so `PositionalOpcode` and `LabelledOpcode` are easier to use.

  But what's more inconvenient is what happens to the offset of an absolute jump
  when the address being jumped to crosses a boundary where its byte index can no
  longer be represented by the same amount of bytes.

  Take for example this EVM code:

  ```
  0x00: push1 255
  0x02: jump
  0x03: stop
  0x04: stop
  0x05: stop
  ...
  0xfe: stop
  0xff: jumpdest
  ```

  which can be represented with the following `LabelledOpcode`:

  ```haskell
  λ> import EVM.Opcode
  λ> import EVM.Opcode.Labelled as L
  λ> import EVM.Opcode.Positional as P

  λ> let opcodes = [JUMP "skip"] <> replicate 252 STOP <> [JUMPDEST "skip"]
  λ> fmap (fmap opcodeText . P.translate) (L.translate opcodes)
  Right ["push1 255","jump","stop","stop","stop",...,"jumpdest"]
  ```

  Note especially the byte size of a `PUSH 255` vs. a `PUSH 256`:

  ```haskell
  λ> opcodeSize (PUSH 255)
  2
  λ> opcodeSize (PUSH 256)
  3
  ```

  Then add another one-byte opcode between the `jump` and the `jumpdest`:

  ```haskell
  λ> let opcodes = [JUMP "skip"] <> replicate 253 STOP <> [JUMPDEST "skip"]
  λ> fmap (fmap opcodeText . P.translate) (L.translate opcodes)
  Right ["push2 257","jump","stop","stop","stop",...,"jumpdest"]
  ```

  Even though one byte was added, because the address of `jumpdest` is now
  greater than 255, all references to it now take more than 2 bytes. Concretely,
  one reference went from 2 bytes to 3 bytes, or rather, one `JUMP "skip"` became
  a `push2 257` instead of a `push1 255`. And if there were many such `jump`s,
  this amounts to a bit of book-keeping.

  This happens at subsequent boundaries as well. While this library handles each
  boundary the same way, it is unlikely to have EVM bytecode of more than a few
  kilobytes at present time.

  ```haskell
  λ> let opcodes = [JUMP "skip"] <> replicate 65532 STOP <> [JUMPDEST "skip"]
  λ> fmap (fmap opcodeText . P.translate) (L.translate opcodes)
  Right ["push3 65537","jump","stop","stop","stop",...,"jumpdest"]
  ```
