  Evdev + Streamly
  ================

  This library provides provides a high level [Streamly](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streamly)-based interface to [evdev](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/evdev), for working with streams of input events.

  It doesn't re-export anything, so you will almost certainly also need to depend directly on both of those packages.

  Many of the functions in this library make use of concurrency, so you will probably want `--ghc-options=-threaded` for any executables you build, in order to enable the threaded runtime, and get the expected behaviour. This should be on by default in a near-future version of GHC.

  Why streamly?
  -------------
  Compared to other Haskell streaming libraries, I've found `streamly` to have a remarkably easy-to-use API, and the best, simplest support for concurrency. For example, merging concurrent streams of events, from different devices, is trivial.

  If you wish to use this library alongside `conduit`, `pipes` etc. then see the *Interoperation* section of [Streamly's tutorial](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streamly/docs/Streamly-Tutorial.html).
