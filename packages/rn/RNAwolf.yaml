description: |-
  The algorithm implemented here-in provides extended RNA
  secondary structure prediction. Each predicted nucleotide
  pairing is extended with an annotation describing which of
  three nucleotide edges is engaged in the pairing. In addition,
  each nucleotide may be engaged in more than one pairing.


  The algorithm is described in

  Please note that "experimental" does mean experimental. We are
  mostly concerned with determining a good set of (heuristic)
  rules for run-time reduction currently. This version does
  include stacking and is able to fold sequences of a few hundred
  nucleotides in seconds.

  Triplet calculations will come back with the next version (in a
  few days). The recursions require a number of changes to keep
  the runtimes down (as has been done for the extended loops
  without triplets).

  We have recently split the Biohaskell libraries into smaller
  individual libraries. In addition, stacking, intermediate
  arrays, fusion and newtype-wrapping did require a number of
  changes. Please send a mail, if you encounter strange behaviour
  or bugs.

  Changes in 0.4.0.0

  * secondary structure constraints (untested and undocumented)

  Changes in 0.3.2.0

  * simpler training wrapper

  * added parallelism option for multi-core systems (reduce
  iteration time for the cost of a possible reduction in
  training efficiency; but should be worth it)

  Changes in 0.3.1.0

  * fixed bugs introduced by bulge/interior/multi-loops
