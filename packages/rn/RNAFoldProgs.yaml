description: |-
  RNA secondary structure following "Fast Folding and Comparison
  of RNA Secondary Structures, Hofacker et al., 1994". Uses the
  Turner 2004 parameter set. The algorithm work on an algebraic
  ring structure that is instanciated as required. This
  prelimenary release contains the minimum-free energy version
  only.

  - Do not expect good runtimes with anything less than
  6.13.201008xx. The newest head produces an executable roughly
  20x faster than GHC 6.12.3.

  - Bugs are likely present in this algorithm. If you find one,
  please send me a mail.

  - One goal is to get the vector library to optimise the loops
  (fold's) in such a way as to get performance close to the
  ViennaRNA package. Right now, we are about 15x slower.

  - Works well with -Odph, -fllvm (llvm is about 70% faster than
  -fasm)

  - 0.0.0.3 forgot a lot of depends!
