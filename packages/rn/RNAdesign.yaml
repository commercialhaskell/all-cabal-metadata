  RNAdesign
  =========

  The RNAdesign program solves the multi-target RNA sequence design problem. You
  can give one or more structural targets for which a single compatible sequence
  is designed.

  HOW TO USE RNAdesign
  ====================

  RNAdesign designs RNA sequences given one or more structural targets. The
  program offers a variety of optimization functions that each can be used to
  optimize candidate sequence towards a certain goal, say, minimal ensemble
  defect or small energetic distance to another target structure.


  RNAdesign input
  ---------------

  Structural targets are given via stdin, preferably via an input file. Below is
  a the small tri-stable from our paper, which you should then pipe to RNAdesign:
  "echo tri-stable.dat | RNAdesign"

  "cat tri-stable.dat:"

   # a tri-stable example target. (optional comment)
   ((((....))))....((((....))))........
   ........((((....((((....))))....))))
   ((((((((....))))((((....))))....))))
   # below follows a simple (and optional) sequence constraint.
   CKNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNB

  The input may contain many comments lines, starting with a hash "#" and at most
  one sequence constraint line. All of these lines are optional, except of course
  for the structural constraints.


  Optimization functions
  ----------------------

  Depending on the actual design you are looking for, you'll want to modify the
  optimization function. Below, the different options available are detailed. By
  giving a complex "--optfun", many different design goals can be tried.

  A good optimization goal is (as an example for three targets):

  --optfun "eos(1)+eos(2)+eos(3) - 3 * gibbs + 1 * ((eos(1)-eos(2))^2 + (eos(1)-eos(3))^2 + (eos(2)-eos(3))^2)"

  This way, the sequence produces close-to-mfe foldings with the targets (left)
  and the targets are close together in terms of energy. (1 * ) scales the two
  terms according to user choice.

  ### binary, combining:

  + - * /  :: the four basic operations
  ^        :: (^) generalized power function

  ### binary, apply function to many targets:

  sum max min   :: run function over set of targets: sum(eos,1,2) or sum(eos,all)

  ### unary, apply to single target:

  eos      :: energy of a structure: eos(1)
  ed       :: ensemble defect of a structure: ed(3)
  partc    :: constrained partition function: partc(1).

  You probably want to use partc in conjunction with eos, where eos is modified
  by a small constant: "0.1 * eos(1) + partc(1)". eos guides the optimizer to the
  first viable sequence, after which the constrained partition function becomes
  active.

  ### nullary, constant for the current sequence:

  Ged      :: global, weighted ensemble defect: Ged
  gibbs    :: gibbs free energy of sequence
  mfe      :: minimum free energy of sequence

  ### special:

  logMN    :: requires four parameters logMN(0.2,0.3,0.3,0.2) penalizes according to given mono-nucleotide distribution in order of ACGU
