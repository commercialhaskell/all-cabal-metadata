description: "# srv\nsrv is a tiny web server for local deployments\n\n## Installation\n\n##
  build from source\n\n```bash\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/thma/srv.git\n$ cd
  srv\n$ stack install \n\n-- or if you don't have stack installed\n\n$ cabal install\n```\n\n##
  Usage\n\n```bash\n$ srv\n\nstarting up srv...\nsrv.yaml not found, generating file
  with default config\nStarting HTTP server on port 8080\nStarting HTTPS server on
  port 8443\n```\n\nDuring the initial run, srv will create a config file \"srv.yaml\"
  \nin the current directory. \n\nYou can edit this file to change the port, the directory
  to serve, \nand also select whether host HTTP or HTTPS or both.\n\nIf HTTPS is selected,
  you can also provide a certificate and key file.\nIf you don't provide both files,
  srv will use a predefined\nself-signed certificate which is meant for local demo
  use only.\n(using this demo certificate will result in a warning in your browser
  \nand some browsers will even refuse to connect.)\n\n## Configuration\n\nHere is
  a sample configuration file:\n\n```yaml\ndocumentRoot: .\nhandlers:\n- - HTTP\n
  \ - 8080\n- - HTTPS\n  - 8443\npathToCert: certificate.pem\npathToKey: key.pem\n```\n\n##
  How to generate your own certificate\n\n```bash\nopenssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048\nopenssl
  req -new -key key.pem -out certificate.csr\nopenssl x509 -req -in certificate.csr
  -signkey key.pem -out certificate.pem\n```\n\n\n\n\n"
