  Changes for Database/BBDB
  =========================

  from 0.7 -> 0.8
  ---------------
  Changed back from Foundation to Prelude to prevent breakage.

  from 0.6 -> 0.7
  ---------------
  Changed over to Foundation rather than Prelude.

  from 0.5 -> 0.6
  ---------------
  The new BBDB version (BBDB3) uses file format 9 now.  Three fields
  were added: a hash field, a creation date field, and a modification
  time field.  Theses used to be present in the notes field.


  from 0.4 -> 0.5
  ---------------
  The BBDB file format changed.  The current version of the format
  is 7.  Once field, called *Affixes* was added, and now the extension
  in a US phone field is required.

  Database.BBDB
  =============

  A relatively primitive (but working) Haskell library to read and write
  BBDB (Insidious Big Brother Database) files.  One major goal was to be
  able to have the following be the identity function:

  ```Haskell
  d <- readBBDB "/path/to/.bbdb"
  -- d is now a Haskell data type
  writeFile (asLisp d) "path/to/copy-of-.bbdb"
  ```

  Because of this goal, the interface is based on lists, and tends to be
  a lot of work to get to the actual data you are looking for.  Sorry
  about that.
