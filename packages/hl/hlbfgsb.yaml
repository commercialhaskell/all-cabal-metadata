description: |-
  Haskell bindings to Nocedal's 3.0 version
  of the Limited memory - Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno - Bounded
  optimization algorithm.

  Initial version, but functional. So far no support for limiting iteration
  count. A more powerful interface should be developed.

  Notice: The fortran code is marked pure, althugh it tends to write
  to standard output at troubled times (should be fixed at some point in time).

  From homepage:
  Software for Large-scale Bound-constrained Optimization L-BFGS-B is a
  limited-memory quasi-Newton code for bound-constrained optimization, i.e.
  for problems where the only constraints are of the form l <= x <= u. The
  current release is version 3.0. The distribution file was last changed on
  2011-08-02.
