  is a tool for suggesting possible improvements to Haskell code. These suggestions
  include ideas such as using alternative functions, simplifying code and spotting
  redundancies. You can try HLint online at [lpaste.net](http://lpaste.net/) - suggestions
  are shown at the bottom. This document is structured as follows:\n\n* [Installing
  and running HLint](#installing-and-running-hlint)\n* [FAQ](#faq)\n* [Customizing
  the hints](#customizing-the-hints)\n* [Hacking HLint](#hacking-hlint)\n\n### Bugs
  and limitations\n\nBugs can be reported [on the bug tracker](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint/issues).
  There are some issues that I do not intend to fix:\n\n* HLint operates on each module
  at a time in isolation, as a result HLint does not know about types or which names
  are in scope.\n* The presence of `seq` may cause some hints (i.e. eta-reduction)
  to change the semantics of a program.\n* Some transformed programs may require additional
  type signatures, particularly if the transformations trigger the monomorphism restriction
  or involve rank-2 types.\n* The `RebindableSyntax` extension can cause HLint to
  suggest incorrect changes.\n* HLint turns on many language extensions so it can
  parse more documents, occasionally some break otherwise legal syntax - e.g. `{-#INLINE
  foo#-}` doesn't work with `MagicHash`, `foo $bar` means something different with
  `TemplateHaskell`. These extensions can be disabled with `-XNoMagicHash` or `-XNoTemplateHaskell`
  etc.\n\n## Installing and running HLint\n\nInstallation follows the standard pattern
  of any Haskell library or program: type `cabal update` to update your local hackage
  database, then `cabal install hlint` to install HLint.\n\nOnce HLint is installed,
  run `hlint source` where `source` is either a Haskell file, or a directory containing
  Haskell files. A directory will be searched recursively for any files ending with
  `.hs` or `.lhs`. For example, running HLint over darcs would give:\n\n```console\n$
  hlint darcs-2.1.2\n\ndarcs-2.1.2\\src\\CommandLine.lhs:94:1: Warning: Use concatMap\nFound:\n
  \   concat $ map escapeC s\nWhy not:\n    concatMap escapeC s\n\ndarcs-2.1.2\\src\\CommandLine.lhs:103:1:
  Suggestion: Use fewer brackets\nFound:\n    ftable ++ (map (\\ (c, x) -> (toUpper
  c, urlEncode x)) ftable)\nWhy not:\n    ftable ++ map (\\ (c, x) -> (toUpper c,
  urlEncode x)) ftable\n\ndarcs-2.1.2\\src\\Darcs\\Patch\\Test.lhs:306:1: Warning:
  Use a more efficient monadic variant\nFound:\n    mapM (delete_line (fn2fp f) line)
  old\nWhy not:\n    mapM_ (delete_line (fn2fp f) line) old\n\n... lots more hints
  ...\n```\n\nEach hint says which file/line the hint relates to, how serious an issue
  it is, a description of the hint, what it found, and what you might want to replace
  it with. In the case of the first hint, it has suggested that instead of applying
  `concat` and `map` separately, it would be better to use the combination function
  `concatMap`.\n\nThe first hint is marked as an warning, because using `concatMap`
  in preference to the two separate functions is always desirable. In contrast, the
  removal of brackets is probably a good idea, but not always. Reasons that a hint
  might be a suggestion include requiring an additional import, something not everyone
  agrees on, and functions only available in more recent versions of the base library.\n\n**Bug
  reports:** The suggested replacement should be equivalent - please report all incorrect
  suggestions not mentioned as known limitations.\n\n### Suggested usage\n\nHLint
  usage tends to proceed in three distinct phases:\n\n1. Initially, run `hlint . --report`
  to generate `report.html` containing a list of all issues HLint has found. Fix those
  you think are worth fixing and keep repeating.\n1. Once you are happy, run `hlint
  . --default > .hlint.yaml`, which will generate a settings file ignoring all the
  hints currently outstanding. Over time you may wish to edit the list.\n1. For larger
  projects, add [custom hints or rules](#customizing-the-hints).\n\nMost hints are
  intended to be a good idea in most circumstances, but not universally - judgement
  is required. When contributing to someone else's project, HLint can identify pieces
  of code to look at, but only make changes you consider improvements - not merely
  to adhere to HLint rules.\n\n### Running with Continuous Integration\n\nOn the CI
  you should then run `hlint .` (or `hlint src` if you only want to check the `src`
  directory). To avoid the cost of compilation you may wish to fetch the [latest HLint
  binary release](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint/releases/latest). For certain
  CI environments there are helper scripts to do that.\n\n**Travis:** Execute the
  following command:\n\n```sh\ncurl -sL https://raw.github.com/ndmitchell/hlint/master/misc/travis.sh
  | sh -s .\n```\n\nThe arguments after `-s` are passed to `hlint`, so modify the
  final `.` if you want other arguments.\n\n**Appveyor:** Add the following statement
  to `.appveyor.yml`:\n\n```powershell\n- ps: Invoke-Command ([Scriptblock]::Create((Invoke-WebRequest
  'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ndmitchell/hlint/master/misc/appveyor.ps1').Content))
  -ArgumentList @('.')\n```\n\nThe arguments inside `@()` are passed to `hlint`, so
  add new arguments surrounded by `'`, space separated - e.g. `@('.' '--report')`.\n\n###
  Integrations\n\nHLint is integrated into lots of places:\n\n* Lots of editors have
  HLint plugins (quite a few have more than one HLint plugin).\n* HLint is part of
  the multiple editor plugins [ghc-mod](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-mod)
  and [Intero](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/intero).\n* [Code Climate](https://docs.codeclimate.com/v1.0/docs/hlint)
  is a CI for analysis which integrates HLint.\n* [Danger](http://allocinit.io/haskell/danger-and-hlint/)
  can be used to automatically comment on pull requests with HLint suggestions.\n\n###
  Automatically Applying Hints\n\nBy supplying the `--refactor` flag hlint can automatically
  apply most\nsuggestions. Instead of a list of hints, hlint will instead output the\nrefactored
  file on stdout. In order to do this, it is necessary to have the\n`refactor` executable
  on you path. `refactor` is provided by the\n[`apply-refact`](https://github.com/mpickering/apply-refact)
  package,\nit uses the GHC API in order to transform source files given a list of\nrefactorings
  to apply. Hlint directly calls the executable to apply the\nsuggestions.\n\nAdditional
  configuration can be passed to `refactor` with the\n`--refactor-options` flag. Some
  useful flags include `-i` which replaces the\noriginal file and `-s` which asks
  for confirmation before performing a hint.\n\nAn alternative location for `refactor`
  can be specified with the\n`--with-refactor` flag.\n\nSimple bindings for [vim](https://github.com/mpickering/hlint-refactor-vim),\n[emacs](https://github.com/mpickering/hlint-refactor-mode)
  and [atom](https://github.com/mpickering/hlint-refactor-atom) are provided.\n\nThere
  are no plans to support the duplication nor the renaming hints.\n\n### Reports\n\nHLint
  can generate a lot of information, making it difficult to search for particular
  types of errors. The `--report` flag will cause HLint to generate a report file
  in HTML, which can be viewed interactively. Reports are recommended when there are
  more than a handful of hints.\n\n### Language Extensions\n\nHLint enables most Haskell
  extensions, disabling only those which steal too much syntax (currently Arrows,
  TransformListComp, XmlSyntax and RegularPatterns). Individual extensions can be
  enabled or disabled with, for instance, `-XArrows`, or `-XNoMagicHash`. The flag
  `-XHaskell2010` selects Haskell 2010 compatibility. You can also pass them via `.hlint.yaml`
  file. For example: `- arguments: [-XQuasiQuotes]`.\n\n### Emacs Integration\n\nEmacs
  integration has been provided by [Alex Ott](http://xtalk.msk.su/~ott/). The integration
  is similar to compilation-mode, allowing navigation between errors. The script is
  at [hs-lint.el](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ndmitchell/hlint/master/data/hs-lint.el),
  and a copy is installed locally in the data directory. To use, add the following
  code to the Emacs init file:\n\n```guile\n(require 'hs-lint)\n(defun my-haskell-mode-hook
  ()\n    (local-set-key \"\\C-cl\" 'hs-lint))\n(add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'my-haskell-mode-hook)\n```\n\n###
  GHCi Integration\n\nGHCi integration has been provided by Gwern Branwen. The integration
  allows running `:hlint` from the GHCi prompt. The script is at [hlint.ghci](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ndmitchell/hlint/master/data/hlint.ghci),
  and a copy is installed locally in the data directory. To use, add the contents
  to your [GHCi startup file](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/ghci.html#the-ghci-and-haskeline-files).\n\n###
  Parallel Operation\n\nTo run HLint on 4 processors append the flags `-j4`. HLint
  will usually perform fastest if n is equal to the number of physical processors,
  which can be done with `-j` alone.\n\nIf your version of GHC does not support the
  GHC threaded runtime then install with the command: `cabal install --flags=\"-threaded\"`\n\n###
  C preprocessor support\n\nHLint runs the [cpphs C preprocessor](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cpphs)
  over all input files, by default using the current directory as the include path
  with no defined macros. These settings can be modified using the flags `--cpp-include`
  and `--cpp-define`. To disable the C preprocessor use the flag `-XNoCPP`. There
  are a number of limitations to the C preprocessor support:\n\n* HLint will only
  check one branch of an `#if`, based on which macros have been defined.\n* Any missing
  `#include` files will produce a warning on the console, but no information in the
  reports.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Why are hints not applied recursively?\n\nConsider:\n\n```haskell\nfoo
  xs = concat (map op xs)\n```\n\nThis will suggest eta reduction to `concat . map
  op`, and then after making that change and running HLint again, will suggest use
  of `concatMap`. Many people wonder why HLint doesn't directly suggest `concatMap
  op`. There are a number of reasons:\n\n* HLint aims to both improve code, and to
  teach the author better style. Doing modifications individually helps this process.\n*
  Sometimes the steps are reasonably complex, by automatically composing them the
  user may become confused.\n* Sometimes HLint gets transformations wrong. If suggestions
  are applied recursively, one error will cascade.\n* Some people only make use of
  some of the suggestions. In the above example using concatMap is a good idea, but
  sometimes eta reduction isn't. By suggesting them separately, people can pick and
  choose.\n* Sometimes a transformed expression will be large, and a further hint
  will apply to some small part of the result, which appears confusing.\n* Consider
  `f $ (a b)`. There are two valid hints, either remove the $ or remove the brackets,
  but only one can be applied.\n\n### Why doesn't the compiler automatically apply
  the optimisations?\n\nHLint doesn't suggest optimisations, it suggests code improvements
  - the intention is to make the code simpler, rather than making the code perform
  faster. The [GHC compiler](http://haskell.org/ghc/) automatically applies many of
  the rules suggested by HLint, so HLint suggestions will rarely improve performance.\n\n###
  Why doesn't HLint know the fixity for my custom !@%$ operator?\n\nHLint knows the
  fixities for all the operators in the base library, but no others. HLint works on
  a single file at a time, and does not resolve imports, so cannot see fixity declarations
  from imported modules. You can tell HLint about fixities by putting them in a hint
  file, or passing them on the command line. For example, pass `--with=infixr 5 !@%$`,
  or put all the fixity declarations in a file and pass `--hint=fixities.hs`. You
  can also use [--find](https://rawgithub.com/ndmitchell/hlint/master/hlint.htm#find)
  to automatically produce a list of fixity declarations in a file.\n\n### Which hints
  are used?\n\nHLint uses the `hlint.yaml` file it ships with by default (containing
  things like the `concatMap` hint above), along with with the first `.hlint.yaml`
  file it finds in the current directory or any parent thereof. To include other hints,
  pass `--hint=filename.yaml`. If you pass any `--with` hint you will need to explicitly
  add any `--hint` flags required.\n\n### Why do I sometimes get a \"Note\" with my
  hint?\n\nMost hints are perfect substitutions, and these are displayed without any
  notes. However, some hints change the semantics of your program - typically in irrelevant
  ways - but HLint shows a warning note. HLint does not warn when assuming typeclass
  laws (such as `==` being symmetric). Some notes you may see include:\n\n* __Increases
  laziness__ - for example `foldl (&&) True` suggests `and` including this note. The
  new code will work on infinite lists, while the old code would not. Increasing laziness
  is usually a good idea.\n* __Decreases laziness__ - for example `(fst a, snd a)`
  suggests `a` including this note. On evaluation the new code will raise an error
  if a is an error, while the old code would produce a pair containing two error values.
  Only a small number of hints decrease laziness, and anyone relying on the laziness
  of the original code would be advised to include a comment.\n* __Removes error__
  - for example `foldr1 (&&)` suggests `and` including the note `Removes error on
  []`. The new code will produce `True` on the empty list, while the old code would
  raise an error. Unless you are relying on the exception thrown by the empty list,
  this hint is safe - and if you do rely on the exception, you would be advised to
  add a comment.\n\n### What is the difference between error/warning/suggestion?\n\nEvery
  hint has a severity level:\n\n* __Error__ - by default only used for parse errors.\n*
  __Warning__ - for example `concat (map f x)` suggests `concatMap f x` as a \"warning\"
  severity hint. From a style point of view, you should always replace a combination
  of `concat` and `map` with `concatMap`.\n* __Suggestion__ - for example `x !! 0`
  suggests `head x` as a \"suggestion\" severity hint. Typically `head` is a simpler
  way of expressing the first element of a list, especially if you are treating the
  list inductively. However, in the expression `f (x !! 4) (x !! 0) (x !! 7)`, replacing
  the middle argument with `head` makes it harder to follow the pattern, and is probably
  a bad idea. Suggestion hints are often worthwhile, but should not be applied blindly.\n\nThe
  difference between warning and suggestion is one of personal taste, typically my
  personal taste. If you already have a well developed sense of Haskell style, you
  should ignore the difference. If you are a beginner Haskell programmer you may wish
  to focus on warning hints before suggestion hints.\n\n### Is it possible to use
  pragma annotations in code that is read by `ghci` (conflicts with `OverloadedStrings`)?\n\nShort
  answer: yes, it is!\n\nIf the language extension `OverloadedStrings` is enabled,
  `ghci` may however report error messages such as:\n\n```console\nAmbiguous type
  variable ‘t0’ arising from an annotation\nprevents the constraint ‘(Data.Data.Data
  t0)’ from being solved.\n```\n\nIn this case, a solution is to add the `:: String`
  type annotation.  For example:\n\n```haskell\n{-# ANN someFunc (\"HLint: ignore
  Use fmap\" :: String) #-}\n```\n\nSee discussion in [issue #372](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint/issues/372).\n\n##
  Customizing the hints\n\nTo customize the hints given by HLint, create a file `.hlint.yaml`
  in the root of your project. For a suitable default run:\n\n```console\nhlint --default
  > .hlint.yaml\n```\n\nThis default configuration contains lots of examples, including:\n\n*
  Adding command line arguments to all runs, e.g. `--color` or `-XNoMagicHash`.\n*
  Ignoring certain hints, perhaps within certain modules/functions.\n* Restricting
  use of GHC flags/extensions/functions, e.g. banning `Arrows` and `unsafePerformIO`.\n*
  Adding additional project-specific hints.\n\nYou can see the output of `--default`
  [here](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint/blob/master/data/default.yaml).\n\n###
  Ignoring hints\n\nSome of the hints are subjective, and some users believe they
  should be ignored. Some hints are applicable usually, but occasionally don't always
  make sense. The ignoring mechanism provides features for suppressing certain hints.
  Ignore directives can either be written as pragmas in the file being analysed, or
  in the hint files. Examples of pragmas are:\n\n* `{-# ANN module \"HLint: ignore
  Eta reduce\" #-}` - ignore all eta reduction suggestions in this module (use `module`
  literally, not the name of the module). Put this annotation _after_ the `import`
  statements.\n* `{-# ANN myFunction \"HLint: ignore\" #-}` - don't give any hints
  in the function `myFunction`.\n* `{-# ANN myFunction \"HLint: error\" #-}` - any
  hint in the function `myFunction` is an error.\n* `{-# ANN module \"HLint: error
  Use concatMap\" #-}` - the hint to use `concatMap` is an error (you may also use
  `warn` or `suggest` in place of `error` for other severity levels).\n\nIf you have
  the `OverloadedStrings` extension enabled you will need to give an explicit type
  to the annotation, e.g. `{-# ANN myFunction (\"HLint: ignore\" :: String) #-}`.\n\nIgnore
  directives can also be written in the hint files:\n\n* `- ignore: {name: Eta reduce}`
  - suppress all eta reduction suggestions.\n* `- ignore: {name: Eta reduce, within:
  [MyModule1, MyModule2]}` - suppress eta reduction hints in the `MyModule1` and `MyModule2`
  modules.\n* `- ignore: {within: MyModule.myFunction}` - don't give any hints in
  the function `MyModule.myFunction`.\n* `- error: {within: MyModule.myFunction}`
  - any hint in the function `MyModule.myFunction` is an error.\n* `- error: {name:
  Use concatMap}` - the hint to use `concatMap` is an error (you may also use `warn`
  or `suggest` in place of `error` for other severity levels).\n\nThese directives
  are applied in the order they are given, with later hints overriding earlier ones.\n\n###
  Adding hints\n\nThe hint suggesting `concatMap` can be defined as:\n\n```yaml\n-
  warn: {lhs: concat (map f x), rhs: concatMap f x}\n```\n\nThis line can be read
  as replace `concat (map f x)` with `concatMap f x`. All single-letter variables
  are treated as substitution parameters. For examples of more complex hints see the
  supplied `hlint.yaml` file in the data directory. This hint will automatically match
  `concat . map f` and `concat $ map f x`, so there is no need to give eta-reduced
  variants of the hints. Hints may tagged with `error`, `warn` or `suggest` to denote
  how severe they are by default. In addition, `hint` is a synonym for `suggest`.
  If you come up with interesting hints, please submit them for inclusion.\n\nYou
  can search for possible hints to add from a source file with the `--find` flag,
  for example:\n\n```console\n$ hlint --find=src/Utils.hs\n-- hints found in src/Util.hs\n-
  warn: {lhs: \"null (intersect a b)\", rhs: \"disjoint a b\"}\n- warn: {lhs: \"dropWhile
  isSpace\", rhs: \"trimStart\"}\n- fixity: \"infixr 5 !:\"\n```\n\nThese hints are
  suitable for inclusion in a custom hint file. You can also include Haskell fixity
  declarations in a hint file, and these will also be extracted. If you pass only
  `--find` flags then the hints will be written out, if you also pass files/folders
  to check, then the found hints will be automatically used when checking.\n\nHints
  can specify more advanced aspects, with names and side conditions. To see examples
  and descriptions of these features look at [the default hint file](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint/blob/master/data/hlint.yaml)
  and [the hint interpretation module comments](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint/blob/master/src/Hint/Match.hs).\n\n###
  Restricting items\n\nHLint can restrict what Haskell code is allowed, which is particularly
  useful for larger projects which wish to enforce coding standards - there is a short
  example in the [HLint repo itself](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint/blob/master/.hlint.yaml#L10-L32).
  As an example of restricting extensions:\n\n```yaml\n- extensions:\n  - default:
  false\n  - name: [DeriveDataTypeable, GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving]\n  - {name: CPP,
  within: CompatLayer}\n```\n\nThe above block declares that GHC extensions are not
  allowed by default, apart from `DeriveDataTypeable` and `GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving`
  which are available everywhere. The `CPP` extension is only allowed in the module
  `CompatLayer`. Much like `extensions`, you can use `flags` to limit the `GHC_OPTIONS`
  flags that are allowed to occur. You can also ban certain functions:\n\n```yaml\n-
  functions:\n  - {name: nub, within: []}\n  - {name: unsafePerformIO, within: CompatLayer}\n```\n\nThis
  declares that the `nub` function can't be used in any modules, and thus is banned
  from the code. That's probably a good idea, as most people should use an alternative
  that isn't _O(n^2)_ (e.g. [`nubOrd`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/extra/docs/Data-List-Extra.html#v:nubOrd)).
  We also whitelist where `unsafePerformIO` can occur, ensuring that there can be
  a centrally reviewed location to declare all such instances. Finally, we can restrict
  the use of modules with:\n\n```yaml\n- modules:\n  - {name: [Data.Set, Data.HashSet],
  as: Set}\n  - {name: Control.Arrow, within: []}\n```\n\nThis fragment requires that
  all imports of `Set` must be `qualified Data.Set as Set`, enforcing consistency.
  It also ensures the module `Control.Arrow` can't be used anywhere.\n\n## Hacking
  HLint\n\nContributions to HLint are most welcome, following [my standard contribution
  guidelines](https://github.com/ndmitchell/neil/blob/master/README.md#contributions).
  You can run the tests either from within a `ghci` session by typing `:test` or by
  running the standalone binary's tests via `stack exec hlint test`.\n\nNew tests
  for individual hints can be added directly to source and hint files by adding annotations
  bracketed in `<TEST></TEST>` code comment blocks. As some examples:\n\n```haskell\n{-\n
  \   Tests to check the zipFrom hint works\n\n<TEST>\nzip [1..length x] x -- zipFrom
  1 x\nzip [1..length y] x\nzip [1..length x] x -- ??? @Warning\n</TEST>\n-}\n```\n\nThe
  general syntax is `lhs -- rhs` with `lhs` being the expression you expect to be
  rewritten as `rhs`. The absence of `rhs` means you expect no hints to fire. In addition
  `???` lets you assert a warning without a particular suggestion, while `@` tags
  require a specific severity -- both these features are used less commonly.\n\n###
