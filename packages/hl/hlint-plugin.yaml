  # `hlint-plugin`

  This is a revival of the [`splint` project](https://github.com/tfausak/splint)
  to create an `hlint` plugin for GHC.

  The main advantages of doing this are:

  - Better integration with GHC tooling

    Now `hlint` errors will appear directly in your tools (e.g. `cabal build`
    `ghcid`, `haskell-language-server`) instead of you having to run `hlint`
    out of band.

  - You only have to lint modules that you rebuild

  - You don't have to parse the module twice

  In order to build this plugin, you will need to:

  - build the `hlint` package with the `-f-ghc-lib` cabal configure option
  - build the `ghc-lib-parser-ex` package with the `-fno-ghc-lib` cabal configure
    option

  To use this plugin, add this package as a build dependency and then enable the
  following GHC options (typically in the `ghc-options:` field of your `.cabal`
  file):

  ```bash
  -fplugin HLint.Plugin
  ```

  You can pass command-line options to `hlint` using `-fplugin-opt`, like this:

  ```bash
  -fplugin HLint.Plugin -fplugin-opt='HLint.Plugin:--ignore=Redundant guard'
  ```

  ## Development

  This repository uses Nix for development.  You can build this package entirely
  using Nix for a specific version of `ghc` by running:

  ```ShellSession
  $ nix develop .#ghc${MAJOR}${MINOR}
  ```

  … replacing `${MAJOR}` and `${MINOR}` with the major and minor version of the
  `ghc` that you're using.  For example, if you're using GHC 9.4, then you'd run:

  ```ShellSession
  $ nix build .#ghc94
  ```

  If you want to develop interactively using Cabal inside of a Nix shell, run:

  ```ShellSession
  $ nix develop .#ghc${MAJOR}${MINOR}
  ```

  Once you are inside that Nix shell, then you can use `cabal` commands, like
  `cabal build` or `cabal repl`.  You can also use `ghcid` or launch your favorite
  IDE from inside this shell.

  To check that this plugin works for all supported GHC versions, run:

  ```ShellSession
  $ nix flake check
  ```
