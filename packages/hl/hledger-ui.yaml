  ghc 8.4, latest deps\n\n* when the system text encoding is UTF-8, ignore any UTF-8
  BOM prefix\n  found when reading files\n\n* -E/--empty toggles zeroes at startup
  (with opposite default to cli)\n\n# 1.5 (2017/12/31)\n\n* fix help -> view manual
  (on posix platforms) #623\n\n* support -V/--value, --forecast, --auto\n\n* remove
  upper bounds on all but hledger* and base (experimental)\n\n\n# 1.4 (2017/9/30)\n\n*

  and --anon options, like hledger CLI (#474) (Jakub Zárybnický)\n\n* accept -NUM
  as a shortcut for --depth NUM\n\n* deps: allow ansi-terminal 0.7\n\n* deps: drop
  oldtime flag, require time 1.5+\n\n\n# 1.3.1 (2017/8/25)\n\n* allow megaparsec 6
  (#594, Simon Michael, Hans-Peter Deifel)\n\n* allow megaparsec-6.1 (Hans-Peter Deifel)\n\n*
  allow vty 5.17 (Felix Yan)\n\n* allow brick 0.24\n\n* restore upper bounds on hledger
  packages\n\n\n# 1.3 (2017/6/30)\n\nThe register screen now shows transaction status
  marks.\n\nThe \"uncleared\" status, and associated UI flags and keys, have been\nrenamed
  to \"unmarked\" to remove ambiguity and confusion.  This means\nthat we have dropped
  the `--uncleared` flag, and our `-U` flag now\nmatches only unmarked things and
  not pending ones. See the issue and\nlinked mail list discussion for more background.
  (#564)\n\nThe P key toggles pending mode, consistent with U (unmarked) and C\n(cleared).
  There is also a temporary --status-toggles flag for testing\nother toggle styles;
  see `hledger-ui -h`. (#564)\n\nThere is now less \"warping\" of selection when lists
  change:\n\n- When the selected account disappears, eg when toggling zero\n  accounts,
  the selection moves to the alphabetically preceding item,\n  instead of the first
  one.\n\n- When the selected transaction disappears, eg when toggling status\n  filters,
  the selection moves to the nearest transaction by date (and\n  if several have the
  same date, by journal order), instead of the\n  last one.\n\nIn the accounts and
  register screens, you can now scroll down further\nso that the last item need not
  always be shown at the bottom of the\nscreen.  And we now try to show the selected
  item centered in the\nfollowing situations:\n\n-   after moving to the end with
  Page down/End\n-   after toggling filters (status, real, historical..)\n-   on pressing
  the control-l key (should force a screen redraw, also)\n-   on entering the register
  screen from the accounts screen (there's a\n    known problem with this: it doesn't
  work the first time).\n\n(Items near the top can't be centered, as we don't scroll
  higher than\nthe top of the list.)\n\nEmacs movement keys are now supported, as
  well as VI keys.\nhjkl and CTRL-bfnp should work wherever unmodified arrow keys
  work.\n\nIn the transaction screen, amounts are now better aligned, eg when\nthere
  are posting status marks or virtual postings.\n\nDeps: allow brick 0.19 (#575, Felix
  Yan, Simon Michael)\n\n\n# 1.2 (2017/3/31)\n\nFix a pattern match failure when pressing
  E on the transaction screen (fixes #508)\n\nAccounts with ? in name had empty registers
  (fixes #498) (Bryan Richter)\n\nAllow brick 0.16 (Joshua Chia) and brick 0.17/vty
  0.15 (Peter Simons)\n\nAllow megaparsec 5.2 (fixes #503)\n\nAllow text-zipper 0.10\n\n\n#
  1.1.1 (2017/1/20)\n\n-   allow brick 0.16 (Joshua Chia)\n\n-   drop obsolete --no-elide
  flag\n\n\n# 1.1 (2016/12/31)\n\n-   with --watch, the display updates automatically
  to show file or date changes\n\n    hledger-ui --watch will reload data when the
  journal file (or any included file) changes.\n    Also, when viewing a current standard
  period (ie this day/week/month/quarter/year),\n    the period will move as needed
  to track the current system date.\n\n-   the --change flag shows period changes
  at startup instead of historical ending balances\n\n-   the A key runs the hledger-iadd
  tool, if installed\n\n-   always reload when g is pressed\n\n    Previously it would
  check the modification time and reload only if\n    it looked newer than the last
  reload.\n\n-   mark hledger-ui as \"stable\"\n\n-   allow brick 0.15, vty 5.14,
  text-zipper 0.9\n\n\n# 1.0.4 (2016/11/2)\n\n- allow brick 0.13\n\n\n# 1.0.3 (2016/10/31)\n\n-
  use brick 0.12\n\n\n# 1.0.2 (2016/10/27)\n\n- use latest brick 0.11\n\n\n# 1.0.1
  (2016/10/27)\n\n- allow megaparsec 5.0 or 5.1\n\n\n# 1.0 (2016/10/26)\n\n## accounts
  screen\n\n-   at depth 0, show accounts on one \"All\" line and show all transactions
  in the register\n\n-   0 now sets depth limit to 0 instead of clearing it\n\n-   always
  use --no-elide for a more regular accounts tree\n\n## register screen\n\n-   registers
  can now include/exclude subaccount transactions.\n\n    The register screen now
  includes subaccounts' transactions if the\n    accounts screen was in tree mode,
  or when showing an account\n    which was at the depth limit. Ie, it always shows
  the\n    transactions contributing to the balance displayed on the\n    accounts
  screen. As on the accounts screen, F toggles between\n    tree mode/subaccount txns
  included by default and flat\n    mode/subaccount txns excluded by default. (At
  least, it does when\n    it would make a difference.)\n\n-   register transactions
  are filtered by realness and status (#354).\n\n    Two fixes for the account transactions
  report when --real/--cleared/real:/status: \n    are in effect, affecting hledger-ui
  and hledger-web:\n    \n    1.  exclude transactions which affect the current account
  via an excluded posting type.\n        Eg when --real is in effect, a transaction
  posting to the current account with only\n        virtual postings will not appear
  in the report.\n    \n    2.  when showing historical balances, don't count excluded
  posting types in the\n        starting balance. Eg with --real, the starting balance
  will be the sum of only the\n        non-virtual prior postings.\n        \n        This
  is complicated and there might be some ways to confuse it still, causing\n        wrongly
  included/excluded transactions or wrong historical balances/running totals\n        (transactions
  with both real and virtual postings to the current account, perhaps ?)\n\n-   show
  more accurate dates when postings have their own dates.\n\n    If postings to the
  register account matched by the register's\n    filter query have their own dates,
  we show the earliest of these\n    as the transaction date.\n\n## misc\n\n-   H
  toggles between showing \"historical\" or \"period\" balances (#392).\n\n    By
  default hledger-ui now shows historical balances, which\n    include transactions
  before the report start date (like hledger\n    balance --historical). Use the H
  key to toggle to \"period\" mode,\n    where balances start from 0 on the report
  start date.\n\n-   shift arrow keys allow quick period browsing\n\n    -   shift-down
  narrows to the next smaller standard period\n        (year/quarter/month/week/day),
  shift-up does the reverse\n    -   when narrowed to a standard period, shift-right/left
  moves to\n        the next/previous period\n    -   \\`t\\` sets the period to today.\n\n-
  \  a runs the add command\n\n-   E runs $HLEDGER_UI_EDITOR or $EDITOR or a default
  editor (vi) on the journal file.\n\n    When using emacs or vi, if a transaction
  is selected the cursor will be positioned at its journal entry.\n\n-   / key sets
  the filter query; BACKSPACE/DELETE clears it\n\n-   Z toggles display of zero items
  (like --empty), and they are shown by default.\n\n    -E/--empty is now the default
  for hledger-ui, so accounts with 0 balance\n    and transactions posting 0 change
  are shown by default.  The Z key\n    toggles this, entering \"nonzero\" mode which
  hides zero items.\n\n-   R toggles inclusion of only real (non-virtual) postings\n\n-
  \  U toggles inclusion of only uncleared transactions/postings\n\n-   I toggles
  balance assertions checking, useful for troubleshooting\n\n-   vi-style movement
  keys are now supported (for help, you must now use ? not h) (#357)\n\n-   ESC cancels
  minibuffer/help or clears the filter query and jumps to top screen\n\n-   ENTER
  has been reserved for later use\n\n-   reloading now preserves any options and modes
  in effect\n\n-   reloading on the error screen now updates the message rather than
  entering a new error screen\n\n-   the help dialog is more detailed, includes the
  hledger-ui manual, and uses the full terminal width if needed\n\n-   the header/footer
  content is more efficient; historical/period and tree/flat modes are now indicated
  in the footer\n\n-   date: query args on the command line now affect the report
  period.\n\n    A date2: arg or --date2 flag might also affect it (untested).\n\n-
  \  hledger-ui now uses the quicker-building microlens\n\n\n\n\n0.27.3 (2016/1/12)\n\n-
  allow brick 0.4\n\n0.27.2 (2016/1/11)\n\n- allow brick 0.3.x\n\n0.27.1 (2015/12/3)\n\n-
  allow lens 4.13\n- make reloading work on the transaction screen\n\n\n0.27 (2015/10/30)\n\n-
  hledger-ui is a new curses-style UI, intended to be a standard part\n  of the hledger
  toolset for all users (except on native MS Windows,\n  where the vty lib is not
  yet supported).\n\n    The UI is quite simple, allowing just browsing of accounts
  and\n  transactions, but it has a number of improvements over the old\n  hledger-vty,
  which it replaces:\n\n    - adapts to screen size\n    - handles wide characters\n
  \   - shows multi-commodity amounts on one line\n    - manages cursor and scroll
  position better\n    - allows depth adjustment\n    - allows --flat toggle\n    -
  allows --cleared toggle\n    - allows journal reloading\n    - shows a more useful
  transaction register, like hledger-web\n    - offers multiple color themes\n    -
  includes some built-in help\n\n    hledger-ui is built with brick, a new higher-level
  UI library based\n  on vty, making it relatively easy to grow and maintain.\n"
