  # CHANGELOG

  ## master



  ## v0.1.3.0

  * Change `Prices` volume field from `Integer` to `Scientific` to support
    decimal amounts returned by cryptocurrency routes.
  * AlphaVantage changed the information message field from `Note` to
    `Information` so we now attempt to parse both and throw an `ApiError` if
    either exist. This usually occurs when you've run out of API calls for the
    day.
  * AlphaVantage changed the `DIGITAL_CURRENCY_DAILY` endpoint to return the same
    price fields as the `TIME_SERIES_DAILY` endpoint, so we dropped the
    `CryptoPrices` type and return the `Prices` type from both the stock & crypto
    API calls.
  * AlphaVantage has swapped premium-only endpoints on us again - now
    `TIME_SERIES_DAILY` is free and `TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED` is paid-only so
    we had to switch back.


  ## v0.1.2.2

  * Switch from the (now premium-only) `TIME_SERIES_DAILY` AlphaVantage endpoint
    to the free `TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED` endpoint.
  * Bump package dependencies.


  ## v0.1.2.1

  * Fix breaking changes in `hledger-lib` v1.26.


  ## v0.1.2.0

  * Add support for fetching cryptocurrency prices with the `-c` flag and
    `cryptocurrencies` config option.
  * Add support for config file at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hstockquotes/config.yaml`
    with `api-key`, `exclude`, & `rate-limit` options.


  ## v0.1.1.0

  * Don't write out a journal file if no prices were successfully fetched.
  * Log API errors to `stderr` instead of `stdout`.
  * Improve error messages when the AlphaVantage API returns a
    rate-limit-exceeded error.
  * Improve documentation in README & `--help` flag.
  * Add trailing newline to generated files.


  ## v0.1.0.0

  * Initial release

  # hledger-stockquotes

  [![hledger-stockquotes Build Status](https://github.com/prikhi/hledger-stockquotes/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/prikhi/hledger-stockquotes/actions/workflows/main.yml)

  `hledger-stockquotes` is a CLI addon for [hledger](https://hledger.org) that
  reads a journal file and pulls the historical prices for commodities from
  [AlphaVantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/). To use this application, you'll
  need a [free AlphaVantage API key](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key).


  ## Usage

  `hledger-stockquotes` parses your journal file, determines what commodities are
  defined, and queries AlphaVantage for prices on the date range present in the
  journal file.

  By default, the program will use the HLedger default file location of
  `~/.hledger.journal`. A `LEDGER_FILE` environmental variable can be used to
  override the location. The `-f` flag can be used to override both the default
  and `LEDGER_FILE` locations.

  At the bare minimum, you need to set an `ALPHAVANTAGE_KEY` environmental
  variable or use the `-a` switch to specify your AlphaVantage key:

  ```sh
  hledger-stockquotes -a MY_API_KEY -f accounting.journal
  ```

  This will print out price directive to a `prices.journal` file.


  ### Custom Output Files

  The output file can be set with the `-o` flag:

  ```sh
  hledger-stockquotes -a MY_API_KEY -o prices/2021.journal
  ```

  NOTE: the contents of the output file will be overwritten if the file already
  exists!


  ### Excluding Commodities

  By default, we query AlphaVantage for all non-USD commodities included in your
  journal file. We do not currently support AlphaVantage's FOREX API route, so if
  you have those commodities, `stockquotes` will print an error when fetching
  them. You can exclude commodities by passing them as arguments to
  `hledger-stockquotes`:

  ```sh
  hledger-stockquotes -a MY_API_KEY AUTO TA_VFFVX
  ```

  NOTE: hledger defines an `AUTO` commodity if you use the default commodity
  directive(`D`).


  ### Cryptocurrencies

  You can specify a list of cryptocurrencies that you wish to pull prices for
  with the `-c` or `--crypto` flag. You can pass a comma-separated list of
  currencies or pass the flag multiple times. We will split the commodities from
  your journal file into a list of equities & cryptocurrencies and hit the
  appropriate AlphaVantage route for each.

  ```sh
  hledger-stockquotes -a MY_API_KEY -c BTC,ETH --crypto XMR -c BNB
  ```


  ### API Limits

  AlphaVantage has an API request limit of 5 requests per minute.
  `hledger-stockquotes` enforces this limit on a per-command basis. A single run
  will fetch 5 price histories, wait 60 seconds, fetch 5 more, etc. Running
  multiple `hledger-stockquotes` commands in sequence will not enforce this limit
  over multiple runs and may result in API errors. You can ignore the request
  limiting with the `-n` flag. To test a command without hitting the API, pass
  the `--dry-run` flag. This will simply print out the commodities and date
  ranges that would be queried instead of making requests to AlphaVantage.


  ### Configuration File

  `hledger-stockquotes` can also be configured via a YAML file at
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hledger-stockquotes/config.yaml`(`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is
  usually `~/.config/`).

  You can set the `api-key`, `rate-limit`, `cryptocurrencies`, `exclude`, &
  `commodity-aliases` options via this file:

  ```yaml
  rate-limit: false
  api-key: DeAdBeEf9001
  cryptocurrencies:
      - BTC
      - XMR
  exclude:
      - USD
      - AUTO
  commodity-aliases:
      MY_BTC_CURRENCY: BTC
      401K_VTSAX: VTSAX
  ```

  CLI flags & environmental variables will override config file settings.


  ### Aliases

  By specifying the `commedity-aliases` option in your configuration file,
  you can rename the commodities used in your journal to the commodities
  expected by AlphaVantage.

  Keys in the map should be your journal commities while their values are the
  AlphaVantage ticker symbols:

  ```yaml
  commodity-aliases:
      MY_VTSAX: VTSAX
      MY_BTC_CURRENCY: BTC
  ```

  Renaming is done after commodity exclusion, but before bucketing them into
  equities & cryptocurrencies so the `exclude` list should use your symbols while
  the `cryptocurrencies` list should use AlphaVantage's:

  ```code
  journal -> exclude -> commodity-aliases -> cryptocurrencies
  ```

  Specifying aliases via command line options or environmental variable
  is not currently supported.


  ### Additional Documentation

  The `--help` flag provides more thorough documentation on all available flags:

  ```sh
  hledger-stockquotes --help
  ```


  ## Build / Install

  This project has not yet been packaged for any OSes or Linux distributions, so
  you'll have to clone this repository & compile/install the code yourself:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/prikhi/hledger-stockquotes.git
  cd hledger-stockquotes
  stack install
  ```

  This will put the `hledger-stockquotes` exe into your `~/.local/bin/`
  directory. Ensure that the directory is included in your `PATH` environmental
  variable. Then you can run the application:

  ```sh
  hledger-stockquotes --help
  ```

  Since the executable has the `hledger-` prefix, you can also use it with the
  `hledger` command:

  ```sh
  hledger stockquotes -- --help
  ```


  ## Development/Manual Builds

  You can build the project with stack: `stack build`

  For development, you can enable fast builds with file-watching,
  documentation-building, & test-running: `stack test --haddock --fast --file-watch`

  To build & open the documentation, run `stack haddock --open hledger-stockquotes`

  To install the executable to `~/.local/bin`, run `stack install`.
