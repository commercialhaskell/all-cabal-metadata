changelog: |+
  # 0.5.0.0
  - Dropped cryptonite for cryptohash-md5, as the latter is leaner and the former is now deprecated
  - Removed global path declarations, as they're vestigial. Any use of `declareGlobal*` should simply be replaced with `declare*`.

  # 0.4.0.0
  - Updated hlrdb-core to 0.2.0.0, featuring revamped aggrevation via the @Q@ applicative, which should be more ergonomic than the old profunctor-based API while providing the same guarantees.

  # New in 0.3.2
  - Added `zstd`, which when used transparently applies zstd compression to the values stored at the given path.

  # New in 0.3.1
  - Support path declaration of new `RedisByteString` primitive in core.

  # New in 0.3
  - Generalized path declarations to any `Store` from `IsIdentifier`.

  # New in 0.2

  - Core dependency bumped to 0.1.1
  - Commands related to key expiration have been moved to the core module, assigned their corresponding names in Redis, and depend on types from the `time` package.
  - `time-exts` has been dropped in favor of `time` for handling timestamps in identifiers, though the semantics should be the same and data should be backwards compatible.
