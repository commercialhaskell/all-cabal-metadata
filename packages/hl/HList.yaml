changelog: "19 Feb 2018\n0.5.0 Release\nBuild & pass tests with ghc-7.6 through 8.4.0.20180209\n\nAdd
  Dredge.hs (ghc>=7.8): access nested records/variants given only the last\nlabel
  along a path\n\nMove toLabel to another class to allow it to return Labels with\nkinds
  other than Symbol.\n\ntipyLens can now change the element type\n\nAdd hTake and
  hDrop\n\nUse TypeError for prettier error messages in ghc-8.0 (still backwards\ncompatible)\n\nImprove
  HFind and HUpdateAtHNat error messages by mentioning the whole\nrecord being changed\n\n22
  Dec 2015\n0.4.2 Release\n\nDepend on base-orphans to avoid multiple definitions
  of Typeable '[],\nTypeable '(:)\n\n3 Aug 2015\n0.4.1 Release\n\nAdd RecordU.hs,
  a record type with elements stored in unboxed arrays\n\nDocumentation fixes (Thor
  Michael Støre)\n\n5 May 2015\n0.4 Release\n\n16 Apr 2015\nMake tests run (and pass)
  when called by \"runghc Setup test\"\n\nAdd hNot, and add HNotFD which is injective
  (unlike the type family)\n\nReplace uses of `HLength xs ~ n` with `HLengthEq xs
  n`.\n\n15 Mar 2015\nAdd HCurry.hs.\n\nRedefine Arity such that `Arity f (HSucc HZero)`
  will refine the\ntype of `f` to `x -> y`.\n\nSameLabels is generalized so that functions
  like 'asLabelsOf' do\nnot need to explicitly convert a that specifies the ordering
  of\nlabels. Additional constraints might be needed to restore the old\nbehavior:\n\n>
  type SameLabelsOld x y = (HAllTaggedLV x, HAllTaggedLV y, SameLabels x y)\n\nSimilarly
  HExtend instances Proxy intended for making Proxies\nused to disambiguate labels
  (see 'asLabelsOf' again).\n\nAdd hMapOutV, zipVR, extendsVariant. Rename the previous\nsplitVariant
  to splitVariant1, and use the name splitVariant for\na function that splits a Variant
  into two Variants.\n\nAdd projected to Labelable.hs which allows working on a smaller\nRecord
  or Variant.\n\nAdd HasFieldM for lookups that return a default value if the\nfield
  is missing.\n\nSplit HZip into two classes: class HUnzip r x y xy => HZip r x y
  xy.\nThis allows instance HUnzip Variant x y xy.\n\nAdd Data,Typeable,Enum,Bounded,Ord,Monoid
  instances for Variant and TIC\n\nImplement HRLabelSet in terms of HLabelSet, which
  simplifies\ninferred types that would otherwise have redundancy (HLabelSet\n(LabelsOf
  r), HRLabelSet r)\n\nMove definitions into FakePrelude, and split up\nexamples/Properties.hs
  into separate modules to help with\ncompilation times when adding new tests.\n\n15
  Feb 2015\nChange HList to a data family (see comments in HList.hs).\n\nChange the
  Show instance for TIP and HList to use \",\" not \", \" as the\nseparator for consistency
  with Record and ordinary lists.\n\nParameterize HZip over the collection type to
  work on Record, TIP as well as\nHList.\n\nAdd and use HProxies for building the
  spine of a HList from the type, to avoid\nhaving HLists of undefined/error values
  somewhere.\n\nBuild with ghc-7.10 RC1. RecordU/RecordUS is moved to broken/ instead
  of\nupdating it.\n\n9 Sep 2014\nChange the ordering of the list produced by HLeftUnion
  / (.<++.)\nto better match hAppend / ++ suggested by the name.\n\n25 Aug 2014\nAdd
  HSort, which provides a merge sort and a quick sort.\n\nSupport _ (wildcard) with
  the pun quasiquoter, and make\npatterns such as [pun| x y _ |] constrain the Record
  or Variant\nto have at least 3 elements.\n\nReduce the number of parameters for
  Labelable\n\nAllow operations with different label kinds (ie.\nRecord [Tagged 1
  x, Tagged \"y\" Int]) to proceed as expected.\n\n13 Jul 2014\nStart RecordU and
  RecordUS, a variation on Record where the values\nare stored in unboxed array(s).\n\nAdd
  Partition, GroupBy and Span.\n\nAdd list2HList and isos sameLength and sameLabels.\n\n23
  Jun 2014\nTIPTransform and TIPTransformM become part of the distribution,\nand missing
  fields are reported with the Fail superclass\ntechnique.\n\nProjection of a TIP
  to a tuple is reimplemented without an explicit\ntype signature. The functions are
  exported as tipyTuple,\ntipyTuple3 etc.\n\nConversion between HLists and up to 6-tuples
  done with HTuple.\n\nAdd ZipVariant, Unvariant, splitVariant, extendVariant,\nan
  instance Eq (Variant v) and an instance Labelable TIC.\n\nAdd quickcheck in examples/Properties.hs.
  Coverage measured with\nHPC is about 40%.\n\n5 Jun 2014\nStart to parameterize operations
  on the collection type. This\nmeans that where we previously had HMapCxt f x y another\ntype
  parameter with kind [*] -> * is added. This means\nprevious uses of HMapCxt f x
  y become HMap HList f x y.\nThis allows hMap to be used with Record and Variant.\nHUpdateAtLabel
  is similarly generalized.\n\nRework Variant: the implementation is now similar to
  Dynamic\nand TIC. Likewise, TIP is implemented in terms of Record.\n\n28 May 2014\nAdd
  tipyLens and ticPrism.\n\nAdd a HExtend instance for Variant.\n\nAdd functional
  dependencies to Labelable (and corresponding\nsuperclasses) to avoid ambiguous types.\n\n26
  May 2014\nAdd prisms for Variant. This adds a dependency on \"profunctors\".\n\nParameterize
  Labelable on the collection type. This allows\nlabelable labels to be used with
  RecordS or VariantS, where\nthe resulting Optic is a Lens or Prism respectively.\n\nRemove
  recordLabels in favor of labelsOf: a kind variable which\nonly appears on the RHS
  required a lengthy type annotation to fix\nthat variable. Pattern matching to convert
  a `Label (a :: k)` to\n`a :: k` happens later on when another value with kind `k`
  is a\navailable on the LHS.\n\nImprove type errors when accessing missing fields
  when using\nLabelable labels. Except for HPrism, the error message contains\n`Fail
  (FieldNotFound \"x\")`. This involved adding a HUpdateAtLabel\nclass and HTPupdateAtLabel
  type which hides the `n` type\nvariable.\n\nReduce the number of parameters to HMapCxt.
  The old version could\nbe defined in terms of the new version as:\n\n\ttype HMapCxt_old
  f a b ha hb = (HMapCxt f a b,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHList a ~ ha,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHList
  b ~ hb)\n\nReimplement RecordValues in terms of HMap. The original\nimplementation
  is kept because it avoids the need for\n-XAllowAmbiguousTypes.\n\nAdd hMapR and
  hMapV to map over the values in a Record or the\nvalue in a Variant respectively.
  These functions are defined in\nterms of HFmap which may be useful on it's own.\n\nAdd
  a typeable instance for Label3, and change examples/cmdargs.hs\nto use this label
  kind. This allows the example to work with\nghc-7.8.2 which lacks an instance Typeable
  (x :: Symbol).\n\n28 Mar 2014\n\tRelease 0.3.4.1\n\tFix build with ghc-7.8 broken
  by changes in HList 0.3.4\n\n20 Feb 2014\n\tRelease 0.3.4\n\tRecordPuns add ( )

  DARCS repository announced.\n\t\n22 June\t2006\n\tVariantP.hs: Our extensible (variant)
  list supports the regular\n\tlist API.\n\t\n20 June\t2006\n\tAdded VariantP.hs --
  polymorphic variants as dual of records.\n\tThe extensibility problem solved? We
  can re-use as much as old\n\tcode as possible, when extending the variant and extending\n\tthe
  functions to the extended variant (and get the subtyping for\n\tfree).\n\t\n19 June\t2006\n\tAdded
  RecordP.hs -- records with unzipped and fully phantom\n\tlabels. Added tests as
  well.\n\t\n08 May\t2006\n\tMainPatternMatch.hs -- example of pattern-matching on

  Bailey, Brian Bloniarz, Gwern Branwen, Einar Karttunen,\n\tand Adam Vogt\n\n\nThe
  HList library and samples\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGetting
  the code\n\n> git clone https://bitbucket.org/HList/hlist HList\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPushing
  changes\n\nYou need an account at bitbucket.org\n\n> cd HList\n> git clone git@bitbucket.org:HList/hlist.git\n>
  git pull\n> git commit --interactive\n> git push\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis
  distribution covers all essential issues discussed in the HList paper,\nthough the
  implementation has been adapted to ghc features implemented\nafter the paper's writing.\n\nAdditional
  examples and HList operations are provided.\nThe code from the database section
  of the HList paper is not included\nsince doing so would have implied inclusion
  of substantial packages,\nnamely the underlying infrastructure for database access
  library.\n\nYou can get HList from Hackage or from bitbucket:\n\n$ cabal update
  && cabal install HList\n\nOr:\n\n$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/HList/hlist HList\n$
  cd HList; cabal install\n\nThe code works --- within the limits exercised in the
  source files ---\nfor GHC-7.6, 7.8, 7.10, 8.2 and 8.4.0.20180209.\nOlder compilers
  are not supported.\n\nOne may run \"cabal test\" to check the distribution.\n\nSee
  ChangeLog for updates.\n\n"
