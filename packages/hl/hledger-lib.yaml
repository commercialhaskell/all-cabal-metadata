  (#438)\n\n# 1.13.1 (2019/02/02)\n\n- stop depending on here to avoid haskell-src-meta/stackage
  blockage.\n\n# 1.13 (2019/02/01)\n\n- in Journal's jtxns field, forecasted txns
  are appended rather than prepended\n\n- API changes:\n\n  added:\n  +setFullPrecision\n
  \ +setMinimalPrecision\n  +expectParseStateOn\n  +embedFileRelative\n  +hereFileRelative\n\n
  \ changed:\n  - amultiplier -> aismultiplier\n  - Amount fields reordered for clearer
  debug output\n  - tpreceding_comment_lines -> tprecedingcomment, reordered\n  -
  Hledger.Data.TransactionModifier.transactionModifierToFunction -> modifyTransactions\n
  \ - Hledger.Read.Common.applyTransactionModifiers -> Hledger.Data.Journal.journalModifyTransactions\n\n
  \ - HelpTemplate -> CommandDoc\n\n\n# 1.12 (2018/12/02)\n\n-   switch to megaparsec
  7 (Alex Chen)\n    We now track the stack of include files in Journal ourselves,
  since\n    megaparsec dropped this feature.\n\n-   add 'ExceptT' layer to our parser
  monad again (Alex Chen)\n    We previously had a parser type, 'type ErroringJournalParser
  = ExceptT\n    String ...' for throwing parse errors without allowing further\n
  \   backtracking. This parser type was removed under the assumption that it\n    would
  be possible to write our parser without this capability. However,\n    after a hairy
  backtracking bug, we would now prefer to have the option to\n    prevent backtracking.\n\n
  \   -   Define a 'FinalParseError' type specifically for the 'ExceptT' layer\n    -
  \  Any parse error can be raised as a \"final\" parse error\n    -   Tracks the
  stack of include files for parser errors, anticipating the\n        removal of the
  tracking of stacks of include files in megaparsec 7\n        -   Although a stack
  of include files is also tracked in the 'StateT\n            Journal' layer of the
  parser, it seems easier to guarantee correct\n            error messages in the
  'ExceptT FinalParserError' layer\n        -   This does not make the 'StateT Journal'
  stack redundant because the\n            'ExceptT FinalParseError' stack cannot
  be used to detect cycles of\n            include files\n\n-   more support for location-aware
  parse errors when re-parsing (Alex Chen)\n\n-   make 'includedirectivep' an 'ErroringJournalParser'
  (Alex Chen)\n\n-   drop Ord instance breaking GHC 8.6 build (Peter Simons)\n\n-
  \  flip the arguments of (divide\\|multiply)\\[Mixed\\]Amount\n\n-   showTransaction:
  fix a case showing multiple missing amounts\n    showTransaction could sometimes
  hide the last posting's amount even if\n    one of the other posting amounts was
  already implcit, producing invalid\n    transaction output.\n\n-   plog, plogAt:
  add missing newline\n\n-   split up journalFinalise, reorder journal finalisation
  steps (#893) (Jesse Rosenthal)\n    The `journalFinalise` function has been split
  up, allowing more granular\n    control.\n\n-   journalSetTime --> journalSetLastReadTime\n\n-
  \  journalSetFilePath has been removed, use journalAddFile instead\n\n# 1.11.1 (2018/10/06)\n\n-
  \  add, lib: fix wrong transaction rendering in balance assertion errors\n    and
  when using the add command\n\n# 1.11 (2018/9/30)\n\n-   compilation now works when
  locale is unset (#849)\n\n-   all unit tests have been converted from HUnit+test-framework
  to easytest\n\n-   doctests now run quicker by default, by skipping reloading between
  tests.\n    This can be disabled by passing --slow to the doctests test suite\n
  \   executable.\n\n-   doctests test suite executable now supports --verbose, which
  shows\n    progress output as tests are run if doctest 0.16.0+ is installed\n    (and
  hopefully is harmless otherwise).\n\n-   doctests now support file pattern arguments,
  provide more informative output.\n    Limiting to just the file(s) you're interested
  can make doctest start\n    much quicker. With one big caveat: you can limit the
  starting files,\n    but it always imports and tests all other local files those
  import.\n\n-   a bunch of custom Show instances have been replaced with defaults,\n
  \   for easier troubleshooting. These were sometimes obscuring\n    important details,
  eg in test failure output. Our new policy is:\n    stick with default derived Show
  instances as far as possible, but\n    when necessary adjust them to valid haskell
  syntax so pretty-show\n    can pretty-print them (eg when they contain Day values,
  cf\n    https://github.com/haskell/time/issues/101). By convention, when\n    fields
  are shown in less than full detail, and/or in double-quoted\n    pseudo syntax,
  we show a double period (..) in the output.\n\n-   Amount has a new Show instance.
  Amount's show instance hid\n    important details by default, and showing more details
  required\n    increasing the debug level, which was inconvenient. Now it has a\n
  \   single show instance which shows more information, is fairly\n    compact, and
  is pretty-printable.\n\n        ghci> usd 1\n        OLD:\n        Amount {acommodity=\"$\",
  aquantity=1.00, ..}\n        NEW:\n        Amount {acommodity = \"$\", aquantity
  = 1.00, aprice = NoPrice, astyle = AmountStyle \"L False 2 Just '.' Nothing..\",
  amultiplier = False}\n\n    MixedAmount's show instance is unchanged, but showMixedAmountDebug\n
  \   is affected by this change:\n\n        ghci> putStrLn $ showMixedAmountDebug
  $ Mixed [usd 1]\n        OLD:\n        Mixed [Amount {acommodity=\"$\", aquantity=1.00,
  aprice=, astyle=AmountStyle {ascommodityside = L, ascommodityspaced = False, asprecision
  = 2, asdecimalpoint = Just '.', asdigitgroups = Nothing}}]\n        NEW:\n        Mixed
  [Amount {acommodity=\"$\", aquantity=1.00, aprice=, astyle=AmountStyle \"L False
  2 Just '.' Nothing..\"}]\n\n-   Same-line & next-line comments of transactions,
  postings, etc.\n    are now parsed a bit more precisely (followingcommentp).\n    Previously,
  parsing no comment gave the same result as an empty\n    comment (a single newline);
  now it gives an empty string.\\\n    Also, and perhaps as a consequence of the above,
  when there's no\n    same-line comment but there is a next-line comment, we'll insert
  an\n    empty first line, since otherwise next-line comments would get moved\n    up
  to the same line when rendered.\n\n-   Hledger.Utils.Test exports HasCallStack\n\n-
  \  queryDateSpan, queryDateSpan' now intersect date AND'ed date spans\n    instead
  of unioning them, and docs are clearer.\n\n-   pushAccount -> pushDeclaredAccount\n\n-
  \  jaccounts -> jdeclaredaccounts\n\n-   AutoTransaction.hs -> PeriodicTransaction.hs
  & TransactionModifier.hs\n\n-   Hledger.Utils.Debug helpers have been renamed/cleaned
  up\n\n# 1.10 (2018/6/30)\n\n-   build cleanly with all supported GHC versions again
  (7.10 to 8.4)\n\n-   support/use latest base-compat (#794)\n\n-   support/require
  megaparsec 6.4+\n\n-   extensive refactoring and cleanup of parsers and related
  types and utilities\n\n-   readJournalFile(s) cleanup, these now use InputOpts\n\n-
  \  doctests now run a bit faster (#802)\n\n# 1.9.1 (2018/4/30)\n\n-   new generic
  PeriodicReport, and some report-related type aliases\n\n-   new BudgetReport\n\n-
  \  make (readJournal\\|tryReader)s?WithOpts the default api, dropping \"WithOpts\"\n\n-
  \  automated postings and command line account aliases happen earlier\n    in journal
  processing (see hledger changelog)\n\n# 1.9 (2018/3/31)\n\n-   support ghc 8.4,
  latest deps\n\n-   when the system text encoding is UTF-8, ignore any UTF-8 BOM
  prefix\n    found when reading files.\n\n-   CompoundBalanceReport amounts are now
  normally positive.\n    The bs/bse/cf/is commands now show normal income, liability
  and equity\n    balances as positive. Negative numbers now indicate a contra-balance\n
  \   (eg an overdrawn checking account), a net loss, a negative net worth,\n    etc.
  This makes these reports more like conventional financial\n    statements, and easier
  to read and share with others. (experimental)\n\n-   splitSpan now returns no spans
  for an empty datespan\n\n-   don't count periodic/modifier txns in Journal debug
  output\n\n-   lib/ui/web/api: move embedded manual files to extra-source-files\n\n-
  \  Use skipMany/skipSome for parsing spacenonewline (Moritz Kiefer)\n    This avoids
  allocating the list of space characters only to then\n    discard it.\n\n-   rename,
  clarify purpose of balanceReportFromMultiBalanceReport\n\n-   fix some hlint warnings\n\n-
  \  add some easytest tests\n\n# 1.5 (2017/12/31)\n\n-   -V/--value uses today's
  market prices by default, not those of last transaction date. #683, #648)\n\n-   csv:
  allow balance assignment (balance assertion only, no amount) in csv records (Nadrieril)\n\n-
  \  journal: allow space as digit group separator character, #330 (Mykola Orliuk)\n\n-
  \  journal: balance assertion errors now show line of failed assertion posting,
  #481 (Sam Jeeves)\n\n-   journal: better errors for directives, #402 (Mykola Orliuk)\n\n-
  \  journal: better errors for included files, #660 (Mykola Orliuk)\n\n-   journal:
  commodity directives in parent files are inherited by included files, #487 (Mykola
  Orliuk)\n\n-   journal: commodity directives limits precision even after -B, #509
  (Mykola Orliuk)\n\n-   journal: decimal point/digit group separator chars are now
  inferred from an applicable commodity directive or default commodity directive.
  #399, #487 (Mykola Orliuk)\n\n-   journal: numbers are parsed more strictly (Mykola
  Orliuk)\n\n-   journal: support Ledger-style automated postings, enabled with --auto
  flag (Dmitry Astapov)\n\n-   journal: support Ledger-style periodic transactions,
  enabled with --forecast flag (Dmitry Astapov)\n\n-   period expressions: fix \"nth
  day of {week,month}\", which could generate wrong intervals (Dmitry Astapov)\n\n-
  \  period expressions: month names are now case-insensitive (Dmitry Astapov)\n\n-
  \  period expressions: stricter checking for invalid expressions (Mykola Orliuk)\n\n-
  \  period expressions: support \"every 11th Nov\" (Dmitry Astapov)\n\n-   period
  expressions: support \"every 2nd Thursday of month\" (Dmitry Astapov)\n\n-   period
  expressions: support \"every Tuesday\", short for \"every <n>th day of week\" (Dmitry
  Astapov)\n\n-   remove upper bounds on all but hledger* and base (experimental)\n
  \   It's rare that my deps break their api or that newer versions must\n    be avoided,
  and very common that they release new versions which I\n    must tediously and promptly
  test and release hackage revisions for\n    or risk falling out of stackage. Trying
  it this way for a bit.\n\n# 1.4 (2017/9/30)\n\n-   add readJournalFile\\[s\\]WithOpts,
  with simpler arguments and support\n    for detecting new transactions since the
  last read.\n\n-   query: add payee: and note: query terms, improve description/payee/note
  docs (Jakub Zárybnický, Simon Michael, #598, #608)\n\n-   journal, cli: make trailing
  whitespace significant in regex account aliases\n    Trailing whitespace in the
  replacement part of a regular expression\n    account alias is now significant.
  Eg, converting a parent account to\n    just an account name prefix: --alias '/:acct:/=:acct'\n\n-
  \  timedot: allow a quantity of seconds, minutes, days, weeks, months\n    or years
  to be logged as Ns, Nm, Nd, Nw, Nmo, Ny\n\n-   csv: switch the order of generated
  postings, so account1 is first.\n    This simplifies things and facilitates future
  improvements.\n\n-   csv: show the \"creating/using rules file\" message only with
  --debug\n\n-   csv: fix multiple includes in one rules file\n\n-   csv: add \"newest-first\"
  rule for more robust same-day ordering\n\n-   deps: allow ansi-terminal 0.7\n\n-
  \  deps: add missing parsec lower bound, possibly related to #596, fpco/stackage#2835\n\n-
  \  deps: drop oldtime flag, require time 1.5+\n\n-   deps: remove ghc < 7.6 support,
  remove obsolete CPP conditionals\n\n-   deps: fix test suite with ghc 8.2\n\n# 1.3.1
  (2017/8/25)\n\n-   Fix a bug with -H showing nothing for empty periods (#583, Nicholas
  Niro)\n    This patch fixes a bug that happened when using the -H option on\n    a
  period without any transaction. Previously, the behavior was no\n    output at all
  even though it should have shown the previous ending balances\n    of past transactions.
  (This is similar to previously using -H with -E,\n    but with the extra advantage
  of not showing empty accounts)\n\n-   allow megaparsec 6 (#594)\n\n-   allow megaparsec-6.1
  (Hans-Peter Deifel)\n\n-   fix test suite with Cabal 2 (#596)\n\n# 1.3 (2017/6/30)\n\njournal:
  The \"uncleared\" transaction/posting status, and associated UI flags\nand keys,
  have been renamed to \"unmarked\" to remove ambiguity and\nconfusion. This means
  that we have dropped the `--uncleared` flag,\nand our `-U` flag now matches only
  unmarked things and not pending\nones. See the issue and linked mail list discussion
  for more\nbackground. (#564)\n\ncsv: assigning to the \"balance\" field name creates
  balance\nassertions (#537, Dmitry Astapov).\n\ncsv: Doubled minus signs are handled
  more robustly (fixes #524, Nicolas Wavrant, Simon Michael)\n\nMultiple \"status:\"
  query terms are now OR'd together. (#564)\n\ndeps: allow megaparsec 5.3.\n\n# 1.2
  (2017/3/31)\n\n## journal format\n\nA pipe character can optionally be used to delimit
  payee names in\ntransaction descriptions, for more accurate querying and pivoting
  by\npayee. Eg, for a description like `payee name | additional notes`,\nthe two
  parts will be accessible as pseudo-fields/tags named `payee`\nand `note`.\n\nSome
  journal parse errors now show the range of lines involved, not just the first.\n\n##
  ledger format\n\nThe experimental `ledger:` reader based on the WIP ledger4 project
  has\nbeen disabled, reducing build dependencies.\n\n## Misc\n\nFix a bug when tying
  the knot between postings and their parent transaction, reducing memory usage by
  about 10% (#483) (Mykola Orliuk)\n\nFix a few spaceleaks (#413) (Moritz Kiefer)\n\nAdd
  Ledger.Parse.Text to package.yaml, fixing a potential build failure.\n\nAllow megaparsec
  5.2 (#503)\n\nRename optserror -> usageError, consolidate with other error functions\n\n#
  1.1 (2016/12/31)\n\n## journal format\n\n-   balance assignments are now supported
  (#438, #129, #157, #288)\n\n    This feature also brings a slight performance drop
  (\\~5%);\n    optimisations welcome.\n\n-   also recognise `*.hledger` files as
  hledger journal format\n\n## ledger format\n\n-   use ledger-parse from the ledger4
  project as an alternate reader for C++ Ledger journals\n\n    The idea is that some
  day we might get better compatibility with Ledger files this way.\n    Right now
  this reader is not very useful and will be used only if you explicitly select it
  with a `ledger:` prefix.\n    It parses transaction dates, descriptions, accounts
  and amounts, and ignores everything else.\n    Amount parsing is delegated to hledger's
  journal parser, and malformed amounts might be silently ignored.\n\n    This adds
  at least some of the following as new dependencies for hledger-lib:\n    parsers,
  parsec, attoparsec, trifecta.\n\n## misc\n\n-   update base lower bound to enforce
  GHC 7.10+\n\n    hledger-lib had a valid install plan with GHC 7.8, but currently
  requires GHC 7.10 to compile.\n    Now we require base 4.8+ everywhere to ensure
  the right GHC version at the start.\n\n-   Hledger.Read api cleanups\n\n-   rename
  dbgIO to dbg0IO, consistent with dbg0, and document a bug in dbg*IO\n\n-   make
  readJournalFiles \\[f\\] equivalent to readJournalFile f (#437)\n\n-   more general
  parser types enabling reuse outside of IO (#439)\n\n# 1.0.1 (2016/10/27)\n\n-   allow
  megaparsec 5.0 or 5.1\n\n# 1.0 (2016/10/26)\n\n## timedot format\n\n-   new \"timedot\"
  format for retroactive/approximate time logging.\n\n    Timedot is a plain text
  format for logging dated, categorised\n    quantities (eg time), supported by hledger.
  It is convenient\n    for approximate and retroactive time logging, eg when the\n
  \   real-time clock-in/out required with a timeclock file is too\n    precise or
  too interruptive. It can be formatted like a bar\n    chart, making clear at a glance
  where time was spent.\n\n## timeclock format\n\n-   renamed \"timelog\" format to
  \"timeclock\", matching the emacs package\n\n-   sessions can no longer span file
  boundaries (unclocked-out\n\n    sessions will be auto-closed at the end of the
  file).\n\n-   transaction ids now count up rather than down (#394)\n\n-   timeclock
  files no longer support default year directives\n\n-   removed old code for appending
  timeclock transactions to journal transactions.\n\n    A holdover from the days
  when both were allowed in one file.\n\n## csv format\n\n-   fix empty field assignment
  parsing, rule parse errors after megaparsec port (#407) (Hans-Peter Deifel)\n\n##
  journal format\n\n-   journal files can now include timeclock or timedot files (#320)\n\n
  \   (but not yet CSV files).\n\n-   fixed an issue with ordering of same-date transactions
  included from other files\n\n-   the \"commodity\" directive and \"format\" subdirective
  are now supported, allowing\n\n    full control of commodity style (#295) The commodity
  directive's\n    format subdirective can now be used to override the inferred\n
  \   style for a commodity, eg to increase or decrease the\n    precision. This is
  at least a good workaround for #295.\n\n-   Ledger-style \"apply account\"/\"end
  apply account\" directives are now used to set a default parent account.\n\n-   the
  Ledger-style \"account\" directive is now accepted (and ignored).\n\n-   bracketed
  posting dates are more robust (#304)\n\n    Bracketed posting dates were fragile;
  they worked only if you\n    wrote full 10-character dates. Also some semantics
  were a bit\n    unclear. Now they should be robust, and have been documented\n    more
  clearly. This is a legacy undocumented Ledger syntax, but\n    it improves compatibility
  and might be preferable to the more\n    verbose \"date:\" tags if you write posting
  dates often (as I do).\n    Internally, bracketed posting dates are no longer considered
  to\n    be tags. Journal comment, tag, and posting date parsers have\n    been reworked,
  all with doctests.\n\n-   balance assertion failure messages are clearer\n\n-   with
  --debug=2, more detail about balance assertions is shown.\n\n## misc\n\n-   file
  parsers have been ported from Parsec to Megaparsec \\o/ (#289, #366) (Alexey Shmalko,
  Moritz Kiefer)\n\n-   most hledger types have been converted from String to Text,
  reducing memory usage by 30%+ on large files\n\n-   file parsers have been simplified
  for easier troubleshooting (#275).\n\n    The journal/timeclock/timedot parsers,
  instead of constructing\n    opaque journal update functions which are later applied
  to build\n    the journal, now construct the journal directly by modifying the\n
  \   parser state. This is easier to understand and debug. It also\n    rules out
  the possibility of journal updates being a space\n    leak. (They weren't, in fact
  this change increased memory usage\n    slightly, but that has been addressed in
  other ways). The\n    ParsedJournal type alias has been added to distinguish\n    \"being-parsed\"
  journals and \"finalised\" journals.\n\n-   file format detection is more robust.\n\n
  \   The Journal, Timelog and Timedot readers' detectors now check\n    each line
  in the sample data, not just the first one. I think the\n    sample data is only
  about 30 chars right now, but even so this\n    fixed a format detection issue I
  was seeing.\n    Also, we now always try parsing stdin as journal format (not just
  sometimes).\n\n-   all file formats now produce transaction ids, not just journal
  (#394)\n\n-   git clone of the hledger repo on windows now works (#345)\n\n-   added
  missing benchmark file (#342)\n\n-   our stack.yaml files are more compatible across
  stack versions (#300)\n\n-   use newer file-embed to fix ghci working directory
  dependence (<https://github.com/snoyberg/file-embed/issues/18>)\n\n-   report more
  accurate dates in account transaction report when postings have their own dates\n\n
  \   (affects hledger-ui and hledger-web registers).\n    The newly-named \"transaction
  register date\" is the date to be\n    displayed for that transaction in a transaction
  register, for\n    some current account and filter query. It is either the\n    transaction
  date from the journal (\"transaction general date\"),\n    or if postings to the
  current account and matched by the\n    register's filter query have their own dates,
  the earliest of\n    those posting dates.\n\n-   simplify account transactions report's
  running total.\n\n    The account transactions report used for hledger-ui and -web\n
  \   registers now gives either the \"period total\" or \"historical\n    total\",
  depending strictly on the --historical flag. It doesn't\n    try to indicate whether
  the historical total is the accurate\n    historical balance (which depends on the
  user's report query).\n\n-   reloading a file now preserves the effect of options,
  query arguments etc.\n\n-   reloading a journal should now reload all included files
  as well.\n\n-   the Hledger.Read.* modules have been reorganised for better reuse.\n\n
  \   Hledger.Read.Utils has been renamed Hledger.Read.Common\n    and holds low-level
  parsers & utilities; high-level read\n    utilities are now in Hledger.Read.\n\n-
  \  clarify amount display style canonicalisation code and terminology a bit.\n\n
  \   Individual amounts still have styles; from these we derive\n    the standard
  \"commodity styles\". In user docs, we might call\n    these \"commodity formats\"
  since they can be controlled by the\n    \"format\" subdirective in journal files.\n\n-
  \  Journal is now a monoid\n\n-   expandPath now throws a proper IO error\n\n-   more
  unit tests, start using doctest\n\n0.27 (2015/10/30)\n\n-   The main hledger types
  now derive NFData, which makes it easier to\n    time things with criterion.\n\n-
  \  Utils has been split up more.\n\n-   Utils.Regex: regular expression compilation
  has been memoized, and\n    memoizing versions of regexReplace\\[CI\\] have been
  added, since\n    compiling regular expressions every time seems to be quite\n    expensive
  (#244).\n\n-   Utils.String: strWidth is now aware of multi-line strings (#242).\n\n-
  \  Read: parsers now use a consistent p suffix.\n\n-   New dependencies: deepseq,
  uglymemo.\n\n-   All the hledger packages' cabal files are now generated from\n
  \   simpler, less redundant yaml files by hpack, in principle. In\n    practice,
  manual fixups are still needed until hpack gets better,\n    but it's still a win.\n\n0.26
  (2015/7/12)\n\n-   allow year parser to handle arbitrarily large years\n-   Journal's
  Show instance reported one too many accounts\n-   some cleanup of debug trace helpers\n-
  \  tighten up some date and account name parsers (don't accept leading spaces; hadddocks)\n-
  \  drop regexpr dependency\n\n0.25.1 (2015/4/29)\n\n-   support/require base-compat
  >0.8 (#245)\n\n0.25 (2015/4/7)\n\n-   GHC 7.10 compatibility (#239)\n\n0.24.1 (2015/3/15)\n\n-
  \  fix JournalReader \"ctx\" compilation warning\n-   add some type signatures in
  Utils to help make ghci-web\n\n0.24 (2014/12/25)\n\n-   fix combineJournalUpdates
  folding order\n-   fix a regexReplaceCI bug\n-   fix a splitAtElement bug with adjacent
  separators\n-   mostly replace slow regexpr with regex-tdfa (fixes #189)\n-   use
  the modern Text.Parsec API\n-   allow transformers 0.4*\n-   regexReplace now supports
  backreferences\n-   Transactions now remember their parse location in the journal
  file\n-   export Regexp types, disambiguate CsvReader's similarly-named type\n-
  \  export failIfInvalidMonth/Day (fixes #216)\n-   track the commodity of zero amounts
  when possible\n    (useful eg for hledger-web's multi-commodity charts)\n-   show
  posting dates in debug output\n-   more debug helpers\n\n0.23.3 (2014/9/12)\n\n-
  \  allow transformers 0.4*\n\n0.23.2 (2014/5/8)\n\n-   postingsReport: also fix
  date sorting of displayed postings (#184)\n\n0.23.1 (2014/5/7)\n\n-   postingsReport:
  with disordered journal entries, postings before the\n    report start date could
  get wrongly included. (#184)\n\n0.23 (2014/5/1)\n\n-   orDatesFrom -> spanDefaultsFrom\n\n0.22.2
  (2014/4/16)\n\n-   display years before 1000 with four digits, not three\n-   avoid
  pretty-show to build with GHC < 7.4\n-   allow text 1.1, drop data-pprint to build
  with GHC 7.8.x\n\n0.22.1 (2014/1/6) and older: see http://hledger.org/release-notes
  or doc/CHANGES.md.\n"
