description: |-
  hledger-irr is a small command-line utility based on Simon
  Michael's hledger library. Its purpose is to compute the internal rate of
  return, also known as the effective interest rate, of a given investment.
  After specifying what account holds the investment, and what account stores
  the gains (or losses, or fees, or cost), it calculates the hypothetical
  annualy rate of fixed rate investment that would have provided the exact same
  cash flow.

  As an example, consider the following irregular investment recorded in a file
  called @speculation.ledger@. The account “Speculation” holds the investment which
  could be, for example, a stock. Regularly, we make sure that the value of the
  account matches the value of the stock, by moving money from or to the account
  “Rate Gain”. It does not really matter when we adjust the price, as long as it
  is correct at the end of our reporting period.

  >   Speculation   -€85.00
  >   Cash           €90.00
  >   Rate Gain     -€ 5.00

  We can now calculate the rate of return for the whole time or just for parts
  of it (and be freaked out by the volatility of the investment):

  > $ hledger-irr -f speculation.ledger -t "Rate Gain" -i Speculation -c
  > 2011/01/01: €-100.00
  > 2011/02/01: €-10.00
  > 2011/03/01: €30.00
  > 2011/04/01: €-50.00
  > 2011/05/01: €47.00
  > 2011/06/01: €90.00
  > 2011/01/01 - 2019/10/06: -100.00%
  > $ hledger-irr -f speculation.ledger -t "Rate Gain" -i Speculation -e 2011-03-01
  > 2011/01/01 - 2011/03/01: 26.12%
  > $ hledger-irr -f speculation.ledger -t "Rate Gain" -i Speculation -b 2011-03-01
  > 2011/03/01 - 2019/10/06: -100.00%
  > $ hledger-irr -f speculation.ledger -t "Rate Gain" -i Speculation --monthly
  > 2011/01/01 - 2011/02/01: 12.49%
  > 2011/02/01 - 2011/03/01: 41.55%
  > 2011/03/01 - 2011/04/01: -51.44%
  > 2011/04/01 - 2011/05/01: 32.24%
  > 2011/05/01 - 2011/06/01: 95.92%

  Running the utility with @--help@ gives a brief overview over the
  available options:

  > $ hledger-irr --help
  > Usage: hledger-irr [OPTION...]
  >   -h          --help                        print this message and exit
  >   -V          --version                     show version number and exit
  >   -c          --cashflow                    also show all revant transactions
  >   -f FILE     --file=FILE                   input ledger file (pass '-' for stdin)
  >   -i ACCOUNT  --investment-account=ACCOUNT  investment account
  >   -t ACCOUNT  --interest-account=ACCOUNT    interest/gain/fees/losses account
  >   -b DATE     --begin=DATE                  calculate interest from this date
  >   -e DATE     --end=DATE                    calculate interest until this date
  >   -D          --daily                       calculate interest for each day
  >   -W          --weekly                      calculate interest for each week
  >   -M          --monthly                     calculate interest for each month
  >   -Y          --yearly                      calculate interest for each year

  Known bugs and issues:

  * Currenlty, hledger-irr does not cope well with multiple commodities (e.g.
  Euro and Dollar, or shares).

  * Also, interest or fees that do not pass through the account selected by
  @--investment-account@ are not taken into consideration.
