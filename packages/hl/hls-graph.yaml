  # hls-graph - a limited reimplementation of Shake for in-memory build graphs

  `ghcide` was originally built on top of [Shake](http://shakebuild.com), a Haskell build system. Nowadays Shake has been replaced by a special purpose implementation of a build graph called hls-graph, which drops all the persistency features in exchange for simplicity and performance.

  Features:

  * Dynamic dependencies
  * User defined rules (there are no predefined File rules as in Shake)
  * Build reports (a la Shake profiling)
  * "Reactive" change tracking for minimal rebuilds (not available in Shake)

  What's missing:

  * Persistence
  * A default set of rules for file system builds
  * A testsuite
  * General purpose application - many design decisions make assumptions specific to ghcide
