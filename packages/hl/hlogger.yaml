description: |
  HLogger is a simple and concurrent logging utility for Haskell under the
  development by the Pontarius project. The goal is to provide a name and facility
  for a set of logging functionalities that many Haskell developers re-invent and
  maintain their own implementations of. We are not entirely sure yet what the
  scope of this library will be, but we will continue to evolve it in parallel
  with the development of Pontarius and HXMPP, utilizing it in those two projects.

  We have just released HLogger 0.1 Alpha 3 with support for custom logging
  behaviors. See the documentation for information on how to use HLogger, and how
  to write your own HLogger extension.

  See <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hlogger/> for more information.

  Please note that we are not recommending anyone to use HLogger at this time as
  it's still in an experimental stage and will have its API and data types
  modified frequently.

  We will release the next version, 0.1 Alpha 3, on the 4th of May.
