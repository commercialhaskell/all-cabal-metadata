synopsis: Command-line interface for the hledger accounting tool
changelog: ! "User-visible changes in the hledger command line tool.\n\n\n# 1.11 (2018/9/30)\n\n*
  The default display order of accounts is now influenced by\n  the order of account
  directives. Accounts declared by account\n  directives are displayed first (top-most),
  in declaration order,\n  followed by undeclared accounts in alphabetical order.
  Numeric\n  account codes are no longer used, and are ignored and considered\n  deprecated.\n\n
  \ So if your accounts are displaying in a weird order after upgrading,\n  and you
  want them alphabetical like before, just sort your account\n  directives alphabetically.\n\n*
  Account sorting (by name, by declaration, by amount) is now more\n  robust and supported
  consistently by all commands (accounts,\n  balance, bs..) in all modes (tree & flat,
  tabular & non-tabular).\n\n* close: new --opening/--closing flags to print only
  the opening or\n  closing transaction\n\n* files: a new command to list included
  files\n\n* prices: query arguments are now supported. Prices can be filtered by\n
  \ date, and postings providing transaction prices can also be filtered.\n\n* rewrite:
  help clarifies relation to print --auto (#745)\n\n* roi: a new command to compute
  return on investment, based on hledger-irr\n\n* test: has more verbose output, more
  informative failure messages,\n  and no longer tries to read the journal\n\n* csv:
  We use a more robust CSV lib (cassava) and now support\n  non-comma separators,
  eg --separator ';' (experimental, this flag\n  will probably become a CSV rule)
  (#829)\n\n* csv: interpolated field names in values are now properly case insensitive,
  so\n  this works:\n\n  fields  ...,Transaction_Date,...\n  date %Transaction_Date\n\n*
  journal: D (default commodity) directives no longer break multiplier\n  amounts
  in transaction modifiers (AKA automated postings) (#860)\n\n* journal: \"Automated
  Postings\" have been renamed to \"Transaction Modifiers\".\n\n* journal: transaction
  comments in transaction modifier rules are now parsed correctly. (#745)\n\n* journal:
  when include files form a cycle, we give an error instead\n  of hanging.\n\n* upper-case
  day/month names in period expressions no longer give an error (#847, #852)\n\n\n#
  1.10 (2018/6/30)\n\n* journal: many parse error messages have become more informative,
  and\n  some now show the source line and error location.\n\n* journal: ;tag: is
  no longer parsed as a tag named \";tag\" (#655)\n\n* journal: transaction price
  amounts having their own price amounts is\n  now a parse error\n\n* journal: amounts
  with space as digit group separator and trailing whitespace \n  now parse correctly
  (#780)\n\n* journal: in amounts containing digits and a single space, the space\n
  \ is now interpreted as a digit group separator, not a decimal separator (#749)\n\n*
  journal: in commodity/format/D directives, the amount must now include a decimal
  separator.\n\n  When more precise control is needed over number parsing, our\n  recommended
  solution is commodity directives. Commodity directives\n  that don't specify the
  decimal separator leave things ambiguous,\n  increasing the chance of misparsing
  numbers. In some cases it could\n  cause amounts with a decimal point to be parsed
  as if with a digit\n  group separator, so 1.234 became 1234.\n\n  It seems the simple
  and really only way to do this reliably is to require\n  an explicit decimal point
  character. Most folks probably do this already.\n  Unfortunately, it makes another
  potential incompatiblity with ledger and\n  beancount journals. But the error message
  will be clear and easy to\n  work around.\n\n* journal: directives currently have
  diverse and somewhat tricky\n  semantics, especially with multiple files.  The manual
  now describes\n  their behaviour precisely.\n\n* journal: `alias` and `apply account`
  directives now affect `account` directives (#825)\n\n* journal: periodic transactions
  can now have all the usual transaction fields\n  (status mark, code, description,
  comment), for generating more expressive\n  forecast transactions.\n\n* journal:
  forecast transactions now have the generating period\n  expression attached as a
  tag named \"recur\".\n\n* journal: periodic transactions now start on the first
  instance of the \n  recurring date, rather than the day after the last regular transaction
  (#750)\n\n* journal: periodic transaction rules now allow period expressions relative
  to today's date\n\n* csv: amount-in/amount-out errors are more detailed\n\n* balance:
  --drop is now ignored when not in flat mode, \n  rather than producing a corrupted
  report (#754)\n\n* budget: --drop now preserves the <unbudgeted> top-level account
  in --budget reports\n\n* register: in CSV output, the code field is now included
  (#746)\n\n* smart dates now allow  the YYYYMM format, and are better documented\n\n*
  use hledger-lib 1.10\n\n\n# 1.9.1 (2018/4/30)\n\n* use hledger-lib 1.9.1\n\n* budget
  (balance --budget): monthly columns are displayed in the\n  proper order.  This
  fixes a regression in 1.9.\n\n* budget: budgets can be built from periodic transactions
  with\n  different intervals again. In 1.9, budgets were restricted to a\n  single
  interval, but this was a mistake. This restores the 1.5\n  behaviour.\n\n* budget:
  budget reports are more intuitive and much less likely to\n  produce no output.\n\n*
  budget: when no report interval is specified, a budget report for\n  the whole journal
  period is shown.\n\n* budget: periodic transactions and the requested report period
  can\n  each have their own start/end dates, and the resulting report will\n  span
  the union of those periods, showing zeroes where data is\n  missing.\n\n* budget:
  total row and total/average columns are now calculated correctly\n\n* budget: actual,
  percentage, and goal amounts are now aligned in\n  columns for better readability
  (usually, unless numbers get huge).\n\n* budget: combining --budget and --sort-amount
  is not yet supported\n  and now gives an error.\n\n* csv: handle \"-%amount\" in
  a rule when the CSV amount is parenthesised (#736)\n\n* journal: automated postings
  are now generated early, before journal finalisation,\n  so they are present for
  amount inference, transaction balancing, and balance assertions\n  (#729)\n\n* journal:
  automated postings are now inserted right after the posting that triggered them\n
  \ (#729)\n\n* cli: command-line account aliases are now applied early, before journal
  finalisation,\n  so they are equivalent to alias directives in the journal (#730)\n\n*
  journal: inferred amounts now have the appropriate standard amount style applied\n
  \ (setting the precision correctly, eg). (#737)\n\n* journal: when checking for
  balanced transactions, amount styles declared with \n  commodity directives are
  also used (previously only inferred amount styles were).\n\n\n# 1.9 (2018/3/31)\n\n*
  support ghc 8.4, latest deps\n\n* journal: account directives can define a numeric
  account code to\ncustomize sorting.  bal/bs/cf/is will sort accounts by account
  code,\nif any, then account name.\n\n* journal: support scientific number notation
  (#704, #706)\n\n* csv: reading a CSV file containing no records is no longer an
  error\n\n* cli: when the system text encoding is UTF-8, ignore any UTF-8 BOM\nprefix
  found when reading files.  (Paypal's new CSV has this BOM\nprefix, causing a confusing
  parse error.)\n\n* cli: tabular reports no longer have a trailing blank line added.\n(This
  allows omitting the \">=0\" delimiters in our functional tests,\nmaking them easier
  to read and maintain.)\n\n* acc: the accounts command now has --declared and --used
  flags\n\n* bal: the --invert flag flips all signs\n\n* bal: --drop now works with
  CSV output\n\n* bal/bs/bse/cf/is: show overall report span in title\n\n* bal/bs/bse/cf/is:
  show short month names as headings in monthly reports\n\n* bal/bs/bse/cf/is: these
  commands can now generate HTML output\n\n* bal/bs/is/cf: drop short name and indent
  fields from multicolumn CSV\n\n* bs/bse/cf/is: these, the \"financial statement\"
  commands, now show\nnormal income, liability and equity balances as positive numbers.\nNegative
  numbers now indicate a contra-balance (eg an overdrawn\nchecking account), a net
  loss, or a negative net worth.  This makes\nthese reports more like conventional
  financial statements, and easier\nto read and share with others. (Other commands,
  like balance, have not\nchanged.)  (experimental)\n\n* bs/cf/is: always show a tabular
  report, even with no report\ninterval.  Previously you would get a simple borderless
  report like\nthe original balance command.  Less code, fewer bugs.\n\n* bs/bse/cf/is:
  in CSV output, don't repeat the headings row for each subreport\n\n* budget: warn
  that CSV output with bal --budget is unimplemented\n\n* budget: bal --budget shows
  budget goals even with no or zero actual amounts. \nMakes budget reports more intuitive,
  at the cost of a temporary hack\nwhich may misorder columns in some cases (if actual
  and budget\nactivity occur in a different range of columns).\n\n* budget: --budget
  uses only periodic txns with the selected interval.  \nBudgets with different interval,
  eg a daily and weekly budget, are independent.\n\n* budget: show mostly fixed-width
  columns for readability\n\n* budget: fix bug where a budget report could include
  budget goals\nending on the day before the report start date (splitSpan issue)\n\n*
  close: the equity command has been renamed to close.  It now ignores\nany begin
  date (it always closes historical end balances).  It also\nignores --date2.\n\n\n#
  1.5 (2017/12/31)\n\n* --auto adds Ledger-style automated postings to transactions
  (Dmitry Astapov, Mykola Orliuk)\n\n* --forecast generates Ledger-style periodic
  transactions in the future (Dmitry Astapov, Mykola Orliuk)\n\n* -V/--value uses
  today's market prices by default, not those of last transaction date. #683, #648\n\n*
  add: suggest implied (parent) and declared (by account directives) account names
  also\n\n* bal: --budget shows performance compared to budget goals defined\n  with
  periodic transactions.  Accounts with budget goals are\n  displayed folded (depth-clipped)
  at a depth matching the budget\n  specification.  Unbudgeted accounts are hidden,
  or with\n  --show-unbudgeted, shown at their usual depth. (Dmitry Astapov)\n\n*
  import: the output of --dry-run is now valid journal format\n\n* print: -B shows
  converted amounts again, as in 1.1, even without\n  -x. #551 (Mykola Orliuk, Simon
  Michael)\n\n* tag: the first argument now filters tag names, additional arguments\n
  \ filter transactions (#261)\n\n* remove upper bounds on all but hledger* and base
  (experimental)\n\n\n# 1.4 (2017/9/30)\n\n* cli: a @FILE argument reads flags & args
  from FILE, one per line\n\n* cli: reorganized commands list, added some new command
  aliases:\n  accounts: a\n  balance:  b\n  print:    p, txns\n  register: r\n\n*
  cli: accept -NUM as a shortcut for --depth=NUM (eg: -2)\n\n* cli: improve command-line
  help for --date2 (#604)\n\n* cli: make --help and -h the same, drop --man and --info
  for now (#579)\n\n* help: offers multiple formats, accepts topic substrings.\n  The
  separate info/man commands have been dropped. help now\n  chooses an appropriate
  documentation format as follows: \n  - it uses info if available, \n  - otherwise
  man if available, \n  - otherwise $PAGER if defined, \n  - otherwise less if available,
  \n  - otherwise it prints on stdout\n  - (and it always prints on stdout when piped).
  \n  You can override this with the `--info`/`--man`/`--pager`/`--cat` flags.\n  (#579)\n\n*
  bal/bs/cf/is: --sort-amount/-S sorts by largest amount instead of\n  account name\n\n*
  bs/cf/is: support --output-file and --output-format=txt|csv\n  The CSV output should
  be reasonably ok for dragging into a\n  spreadsheet and reformatting.\n\n* bal/bs/cf/is:
  consistent double space between columns, consistent\n  single final blank line.
  \ Previously, amounts wider than the column\n  headings would be separated by only
  a single space.\n\n* bs/is: don't let an empty subreport disable the grand totals
  (fixes #588)\n\n* cf: exclude asset accounts with \":fixed\" in their name (Christian
  G. Warden, Simon Michael, #584)\n\n* new balancesheetequity command: like balancesheet
  but also shows\n  equity accounts (Nicholas Niro)\n\n* new import command: adds
  new transactions seen in one or more input\n  files to the main journal file\n\n*
  print: --new shows only transactions added since last time\n  (saves state in .latest.JOURNALFILE
  file)\n\n* new tags command: lists tags in matched transactions\n\n* most addons
  formerly shipped in bin/ are now builtin commands. These\n  include: check-dates,
  check-dupes, equity, prices, print-unique,\n  register-match, rewrite.\n\n* refactor:
  new Commands module and subdirectory.\n  Builtin commands are now gathered more
  tightly in a single module,\n  Hledger.Cli.Commands, facilitating change.  The legacy
  \"convert\"\n  command has been dropped.\n\n* refactor: BalanceView -> CompoundBalanceCommand\n\n*
  deps: drop support for directory < 1.2\n\n* deps: allow ansi-terminal 0.7\n\n* deps:
  drop oldtime flag, require time 1.5+\n\n* deps: simplify shakespeare bounds\n\n*
  deps: remove ghc < 7.6 support\n\n\n# 1.3.1 (2017/8/25)\n\n* bs/is: don't let an
  empty subreport disable the grand totals (#588)\n\n* allow megaparsec 6 (#594)\n\n*
  allow megaparsec-6.1 (Hans-Peter Deifel)\n\n* restore upper bounds on hledger packages\n\n\n#
  1.3 (2017/6/30)\n\nThe \"uncleared\" transaction/posting status, and associated
  UI flags\nand keys, have been renamed to \"unmarked\" to remove ambiguity and\nconfusion.
  \ This means that we have dropped the `--uncleared` flag,\nand our `-U` flag now
  matches only unmarked things and not pending\nones. See the issue and linked mail
  list discussion for more\nbackground. (#564)\n\nAlso the -P short flag has been
  added for --pending, and the -U/-P/-C\nflags can be combined. \n\nbs/is: fix \"Ratio
  has zero denominator\" error (#535)\n\nbs/is/cf: fix --flat (#552) (Justin Le, Simon
  Michael)\n\nbal/bs/is/cf: show negative amounts in red (Simon Michael, Justin Le).\nThese
  commands now shows negative amounts in red, when hledger detects\nthat ANSI codes
  are supported, (ie when TERM is not \"dumb\" and stdout\nis not being redirected
  or piped).\n\nprint: show pending mark on postings (fixes #563).\nA pending mark
  on postings is now displayed, just like a cleared mark.\nAlso there will now be
  a space between the mark and account name.\n\nprint: amounts are now better aligned,
  eg when there are posting\nstatus marks or virtual postings\n\n\n# 1.2 (2017/3/31)\n\n##
  CLI\n\n\"hledger\" and \"hledger -h\" now print a better organised commands list\nand
  general usage message respectively (#297).\n\nThe common reporting flags can now
  be used anywhere on the command line.\n\nFixed deduplication of addons in commands
  list.\n\nFixed ugly stack traces in command line parse error messages.\n\nThe -V/--value
  flag is now a global report flag, so it works with\nbalance, print, register, balancesheet,
  incomestatement, cashflow,\netc. (Justin Le)\n\nThe `--pivot` global reporting option
  replaces all account names with\nthe value of some other field or tag. It has been
  improved, eg:\n\n- we don't add the field/tag name name as a prefix\n- when pivoting
  on a tag, if the tag is missing we show a blank \n  (rather than showing mixed tag
  values and account names)\n- a pipe character delimiter may be used in descriptions
  to get a more accurate\n  and useful payee report (`hledger balance --pivot payee`)\n\noptions
  cleanups\n\n## Addons\n\nEasier installation:\nmove add-ons and example scripts
  to bin/, \nconvert to stack scripts,\nadd a build script to install all deps,\nadd
  some functional tests,\ntest add-ons with Travis CI,\nadd installation docs to download
  page.\n\nImproved docs: \nall addons now contain their own documentation. Most of
  them (all but\nhledger-budget) use a new reduced-boilerplate declaration format\nand
  can show short (-h) and long (--help) command line help.\n(Long help is declared
  with pre and postambles to the generated\noptions help, short help is that truncated
  at the start of the hledger\ncommon flags.)\n\n`hledger` now shows a cleaner list
  of addon commands, showing only the\ncompiled version of an addon when both source
  and compiled versions\nare in $PATH. (Addons with .exe extension or no extension
  are\nconsidered compiled.  Modification time is not checked, ie, an old\ncompiled
  addon will override a newer source version.  If there are\nthree or more versions
  of an addon, all are shown.  )\n\nNew addons added/included:\n\n- autosync - example
  symlink to ledger-autosync\n- budget - experimental budget reporting command supporting
  Ledger-like periodic transactions and automated transactions (Mykola Orliuk)\n-
  chart - pie-chart-generating prototype, a repackaging of the old hledger-chart tool\n-
  check - more powerful balance assertions (Michael Walker)\n- check-dupes - find
  accounts sharing the same leaf name (Stefano Rodighiero)\n- prices - show all market
  price records (Mykola Orliuk)\n- register-match - a helper for ledger-autosync's
  deduplication, finds best match for a transaction description\n\nThe equity command
  now always generates a valid journal transaction,\nhandles prices better, and adds
  balance assertions (Mykola Orliuk).\n\nThe rewrite command is more robust and powerful
  (Mykola Orliuk):\n\n- in addition to command-line rewrite options, it understands
  rewrite rules\n  defined in the journal, similar to Ledger's automated transactions
  (#99).\n  Eg:\n    ```journal\n    = ^income\n        (liabilities:tax)  *.33\n\n
  \   = expenses:gifts\n        budget:gifts  *-1\n        assets:budget  *1\n    ```\n\n-
  it can generate diff output, allowing easier review of the proposed\n  changes,
  and safe modification of original journal files (preserving\n  file-level comments
  and directives). Eg:\n    ```\n    hledger-rewrite --diff Agency --add-posting 'Expenses:Taxes
  \ *0.17' | patch\n    ```\n\n- rewrites can affect multiple postings in a transaction,
  not just one.\n\n- posting-specific dates are handled better\n\n## balance\n\nA
  new --pretty-tables option uses unicode characters for rendering\ntable borders
  in multicolumn reports (#522) (Moritz Kiefer)\n\n## balancesheet/cashflow/incomestatement\n\nThese
  commands are now more powerful, able to show multicolumn reports\nand generally
  having the same features as the balance command. (Justin Le)\n\nbalancesheet has
  always ignored a begin date specified with a `-b` or\n`-p` option; now it also ignores
  a begin date specified with a `date:`\nquery. (Related discussion at #531)\n\n##
  print\n\nThe output of print is now always a valid journal (fixes #465) (Mykola
  Orliuk).\n\nprint now tries to preserves the format of implicit/explicit balancing\namounts
  and prices, by default. To print with all amounts explicit,\nuse the new `--explicit/-x`
  flag (fixes #442). (Mykola Orliuk)\n    \nDon't lose the commodity of zero amounts/zero
  balance assertions (fixes #475) (Mykola Orliuk)\n\n## Misc\n\nFix a regression in
  the readability of option parsing errors (#478) (Hans-Peter Deifel)\n\nFix an example
  in Cli/Main.hs (Steven R. Baker)\n\nAllow megaparsec 5.2 (#503)\n\n\n# 1.1 (2016/12/31)\n\n##
  balance\n\n-   with -V, don't ignore market prices in the future (#453, #403)\n\n-
  \  with -V and multiple same-date market prices, use the last parsed not the highest
  price (#403)\n\n## misc\n\n-   fix non-existent \"oldtime\" dependency (#431)\n\n-
  \  extra/hledger-equity.hs now generates valid journal format when there are multiple
  commodities\n\n\n# 1.0.1 (2016/10/27)\n\n- allow megaparsec 5.0 or 5.1\n\n- fix
  benchmark build failure (#423)\n\n\n# 1.0 (2016/10/26)\n\n## add\n\n-   suggest
  only one commodity at a time as default amount (#383)\n\n    (since we currently
  can't input more than one at a time)\n\n## balance\n\n-   added --change flag for
  consistency\n\n-   -H/--historical now also affects single-column balance reports
  with a start date (#392).\n\n    This has the same effect as just omitting the start
  date, but adds consistency.\n\n-   in CSV output, render amounts in one-line format
  (#336)\n\n## balancesheet\n\n-   fix an infinite loop (#393)\n\n## print\n\n-   in
  CSV output, fix and rename the transaction id field\n\n## register\n\n-   fix a
  sorting regression with --date2 (#326)\n\n-   --average/-A is now affected by --historical/-H\n\n-
  \  added --cumulative flag for consistency\n\n-   in CSV output, include the transaction
  id and rename the total field (#391)\n\n## stats\n\n-   fixed an issue with ordering
  of include files\n\n## misc\n\n-   --pivot option added, groups postings by tag
  instead of account (#323) (Malte Brandy)\n\n-   --anon option added, obfuscates
  account names and descriptions (#265) (Brian Scott)\n\n    (Only affects the hledger
  tool, for now.)\n\n-   try to clarify balance/register's various report modes,\n\n
  \   kinds of \"balance\" displayed, and related options and language.\n\n-   with
  multiple --change/--cumulative/--historical flags, use the last one instead of complaining\n\n-
  \  don't add the \"d\" suffix when displaying day periods\n\n-   stack-ify extra/hledger-rewrite.hs\n\n\n\n\n0.27
  (2015/10/30)\n\nAccount aliases:\n\n- Regular expression account aliases are now
  fast enough that you can\n  use lots of them without slowing things down. They now
  take\n  O(aliases x accounts) time, instead of O(aliases x transactions);\n  also,
  regular expressions are no longer recompiled unnecessarily.\n\nDocumentation:\n\n-
  The hledger packages now have man pages, based on the current user\n  manual, thanks
  to the mighty pandoc (#282).\n \nJournal format:\n\n- Dates must now begin with
  a digit (not /, eg).\n\n- The comment directive longer requires an end comment,
  and will\n  extend to the end of the file(s) without it.\n\nCommand-line interface:\n\n-
  Output (balance reports, register reports, print output etc.)\n  containing wide
  characters, eg chinese/japanese/korean characters,\n  should now align correctly,
  when viewed in apps and fonts that show\n  wide characters as double width (#242).\n
  \n- The argument for --depth or depth: must now be positive.\n\nadd:\n\n- Journal
  entries are now written with all amounts explicit, to avoid\n  losing price info
  (#283).\n\n- Fixed a bug which sometimes (when the same letter pair was repeated)\n
  \ caused it not to pick the most similar past transaction for defaults.\n    \nbalance:\n\n-
  There is now a -V/--value flag to report current market value (as in Ledger).\n
  \ It converts all reported amounts using their \"default market price\".\n  \"Market
  price\" is the new name for \"historical prices\", defined with the P directive.\n
  \ The default market price for a commodity is the most recent one found in the journal
  on or before the report end date.\n    \n    Unlike Ledger, hledger's -V uses only
  the market prices recorded\n  with P directives; it does not use the \"transaction
  prices\"\n  recorded as part of posting amounts (which are used by -B/--cost).\n
  \ Also, using both -B and -V at the same time is supported.\n\n- Fixed a bug in
  amount normalization which caused amount styles\n  (commodity symbol placement,
  decimal point character, etc.) to be\n  lost in certain cases (#230, #276).\n\n-
  The balance command's --format option can now adjust the rendering\n  style of multi-commodity
  amounts, if you begin the format string\n  with one of:\n    \n     %_  - renders
  amounts on multiple lines, bottom-aligned (the default)\n     %^  - renders amounts
  on multiple lines, top-aligned\n     %,  - renders amounts on one line, comma-separated\n
  \   \n- The balance report's final total (and the line above it) now adapt\n  themselves
  to a custom --format.\n\nprint:\n\n- The --match option prints the journal entry
  that best matches a\n  description (ie whose description field is most similar to
  the value\n  given, and if there are several equally similar, the most recent).\n
  \ This was originally an add-on I used to guess account names for\n  ledger-autosync.
  It's nice for quickly looking up a recent\n  transaction from a guessed or partial
  description.\n\n- print now always right-aligns the amounts in an entry, even when\n
  \ they are wider than 12 characters.  (If there is a price, it's\n  considered part
  of the amount for right-alignment.)\n\nregister:\n\n- Amount columns now resize
  automatically, using more space if it's\n  needed and available.\n\n\n0.26 (2015/7/12)\n\nAccount
  aliases:\n\n- Account aliases are once again non-regular-expression-based, by default.
  (#252)\n    \n    The regex account aliases added in 0.24 trip up people switching
  between\n    hledger and Ledger. (Also they are currently slow).\n    \n    This
  change makes the old non-regex aliases the default; they are\n    unsurprising,
  useful, and pretty close in functionality to Ledger's.\n    \n    The new regex
  aliases are still available; they must be enclosed\n    in forward slashes. (Ledger
  effectively ignores these.)\n    \nJournal format:\n\n- We now parse, and also print,
  journal entries with no postings, as\n  proposed on the mail lists.  These are not
  well-formed General\n  Journal entries/transactions, but here is my rationale:\n
  \   \n    - Ledger and beancount parse them\n    - if they are parsed, they should
  be printed\n    - they provide a convenient way to record (and report) non-transaction
  events\n    - they permit more gradual introduction and learning of the concepts.\n
  \     So eg a beginner can keep a simple journal before learning about accounts
  and postings.\n\n- Trailing whitespace after a `comment` directive is now ignored.\n\nCommand-line
  interface:\n\n- The -f/file option may now be used multiple times. \n  This is equivalent
  to concatenating the input files before running hledger.\n  The add command adds
  entries to the first file specified.\n\nQueries:\n\n- real: (no argument) is now
  a synonym for real:1\n\n- tag: now matches tag names with a regular expression,
  like most other queries\n\n- empty: is no longer supported, as it overlaps a bit
  confusingly with\n  amt:0. The --empty flag is still available.\n\n- You can now
  match on pending status (#250)\n    \n    A transaction/posting status of ! (pending)
  was effectively equivalent\n    to * (cleared). Now it's a separate state, not matched
  by --cleared.\n    The new Ledger-compatible --pending flag matches it, and so does\n
  \   --uncleared.\n\n    The relevant search query terms are now status:*, status:!
  and\n    status: (the old status:1 and status:0 spellings are deprecated).\n    \n
  \   Since we interpret --uncleared and status: as \"any state except cleared\",\n
  \   it's not currently possible to match things which are neither cleared\n    nor
  pending.\n\nactivity:\n- activity no longer excludes 0-amount postings by default.\n\nadd:\n-
  Don't show quotes around the journal file path in the \"Creating...\"\n  message,
  for consistency with the subsequent \"Adding...\" message.\n\nbalancesheet:\n- Accounts
  beginning with \"debt\" or now also recognised as liabilities.\n\nprint:\n- We now
  limit the display precision of inferred prices. (#262)\n    \n    When a transaction
  posts to two commodities without specifying the\n    conversion price, we generate
  a price which makes it balance (cf\n    http://hledger.org/manual.html#prices).
  The print command showed\n    this with full precision (so that manual calculations
  with the\n    displayed numbers would look right), but this sometimes meant we\n
  \   showed 255 digits (when there are multiple postings in the\n    commodity being
  priced, and the averaged unit price is an\n    irrational number). In this case
  we now set the price's display\n    precision to the sum of the (max) display precisions
  of the\n    commodities involved. An example:\n    \n    hledgerdev -f- print\n
  \   <<<\n    1/1\n        c    C 10.00\n        c    C 11.00\n        d  D -320.00\n
  \   >>>\n    2015/01/01\n        c  C 10.00 @ D 15.2381\n        c  C 11.00 @ D
  15.2381\n        d     D -320.00\n    \n    >>>=0\n    \n    There might still be
  cases where this will show more price decimal\n    places than necessary. \n\n-
  We now show inferred unit prices with at least 2 decimal places.\n    \n    When
  inferring prices, if the commodities involved have low\n    display precisions,
  we don't do a good job of rendering\n    accurate-looking unit prices. Eg if the
  journal doesn't use any\n    decimal places, any inferred unit prices are also displayed
  with\n    no decimal places, which makes them look wrong to the user.  Now,\n    we
  always give inferred unit prices a minimum display precision of\n    2, which helps
  a bit.\n\nregister:\n- Postings with no amounts could give a runtime error in some
  obscure case, now fixed.\n\nstats: \n- stats now supports -o/--outputfile, like
  register/balance/print.\n- An O(n^2) performance slowdown has been fixed, it's now
  much faster on large journals.\n\n      +--------------------------------------++--------+--------+\n

  The June 30 day span was not being rendered correctly; fixed. (#272)\n\n- The bench
  script invoked by \"cabal bench\" or \"stack bench\" now runs\n  some simple benchmarks.\n
  \   \n    You can get more accurate benchmark times by running with --criterion.\n
  \   This will usually give much the same numbers and takes much longer.\n    \n
  \   Or with --simplebench, it benchmarks whatever commands are\n    configured in
  bench/default.bench. This mode uses the first\n    \"hledger\" executable in $PATH.\n\n-
  The deprecated shakespeare-text dependency has been removed more thoroughly.\n\n\n0.25.1
  (2015/4/29)\n\n- timelog: support the description field (#247)\n\n\n0.25 (2015/4/7)\n\n-
  GHC 7.10 compatibility (#239)\n\n- build with terminfo support on POSIX systems
  by default\n    \n    On non-windows systems, we now build with terminfo support
  by\n    default, useful for detecting terminal width and other things.\n\n    This
  requires the C curses dev libaries, which makes POSIX\n    installation slightly
  harder; if it causes problems you can\n    disable terminfo support with the new
  `curses` cabal flag, eg:\n    cabal install -f-curses ... (or cabal might try this\n
  \   automatically, I'm not sure).\n\n- register: use the full terminal width, respect
  COLUMNS, allow column width adjustment\n    \n    On POSIX systems, register now
  uses the full terminal width by\n    default. Specifically, the output width is
  set from:\n    \n    1. a --width option\n    2. or a COLUMNS environment variable
  (NB: not the same as a bash shell var)\n    3. or on POSIX (non-windows) systems,
  the current terminal width\n    4. or the default, 80 characters.\n    \n    Also,
  register's --width option now accepts an optional\n    description column width
  following the overall width (--width\n    WIDTH[,DESCWIDTH]). This also sets the
  account column width, since\n    the available space (WIDTH-41) is divided up between
  these two\n    columns. Here's a diagram:\n    \n    <---------------------------------
  width (W) ---------------------------------->\n    date (10)  description (D)       account
  (W-41-D)     amount (12)   balance (12)\n    DDDDDDDDDD dddddddddddddddddddd  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
  \ AAAAAAAAAAAA  AAAAAAAAAAAA\n    \n    Examples:\n    $ hledger reg                 #
  use terminal width on posix\n    $ hledger reg -w 100          # width 100, equal
  description/account widths\n    $ hledger reg -w 100,40       # width 100, wider
  description\n    $ hledger reg -w $COLUMNS,100 # terminal width and set description
  width\n\n- balance: new -T/--row-total and -A/--average options\n\n  In multicolumn
  balance reports, -T/--row-total now shows a row totals\n  column and -A/--average
  shows a row averages column.\n  This helps eg to see monthly average expenses (hledger
  bal ^expenses -MA).\n\n  NB our use of -T deviates from Ledger's UI, where -T sets
  a custom\n  final total expression.\n\n- balance: -N is now short for --no-total\n-
  balance: fix partially-visible totals row with --no-total\n    \n    A periodic
  (not using --cumulative or --historical) balance report\n    with --no-total now
  hides the totals row properly.\n\n- journal, csv: comment lines can also start with
  *\n    \n    As in Ledger. This means you can embed emacs org/outline-mode nodes
  in\n    your journal file and manipulate it like an outline.\n\n0.24.1 (2015/3/15)\n\n-
  journal: fix balance accumulation across assertions (#195)\n    \n    A sequence
  of balance assertions asserting first one commodity, then\n    another, then the
  first again, was not working.\n\n- timelog: show hours with two decimal places instead
  of one (#237)\n- in weekly reports, simplify week 52's heading like the others\n-
  disallow trailing garbage in a number of parsers\n\n    Trailing garbage is no longer
  ignored when parsing the following:\n    balance --format option, register --width
  option, hledger-rewrite\n    options, hledger add's inputs, CSV amounts, posting
  amounts,\n    posting dates in tags.\n\n- allow utf8-string-1 (fpco/stackage/#426)\n\n0.24
  (2014/12/25)\n\nGeneral:\n- fix redundant compilation when cabal installing the
  hledger packages\n- switch to Decimal for representing amounts (#118)\n- report
  interval headings (eg in balance, register reports) are shown\n  compactly when
  possible\n- general speedups\n\nJournal format:\n- detect decimal point and digit
  groups more robustly (#196)\n- check that transaction dates are followed by whitespace
  or newline\n- check that dates use a consistent separator character\n- balance assertions
  now are specific to a single commodity, like\n  Ledger (#195)\n- support multi-line
  comments using \"comment\", \"end comment\"\n  directives, like Ledger\n\nCSV format:\n-
  reading CSV data from stdin now works better\n- the rules file include directive
  is now relative to the current\n  file's directory (#198)\n- the original order
  of same-day transactions is now usually preserved\n  (if the records appear to be
  in reverse date order, we reverse them\n  before finally sorting by transaction
  date)\n- CSV output is now built in to the balance, print, and register\n  commands,
  controlled by -O/--output-format (and -o/--output-file,\n  see below)\n\nCLI:\n-
  the --width and --debug options now require their argument (#149)\n- when an option
  is repeated, the last value takes precedence (#219).\n  This is helpful eg for customising
  your reporting command aliases on\n  the fly.\n- smart dates (used in -p/-b/-e/date:/date2:)
  now must use a\n  consistent separator character, and must be parseable to the end\n-
  output destination and format selection is now built in to the\n  balance, print
  and register commands, controlled by -o/--output-file\n  and -O/--output-format
  options. Notes:\n  - -o - means stdout\n  - an output file name suffix matching
  a supported format will also\n    set the output format, unless overridden by --output-format\n
  \ - commands' supported output formats are listed in their\n    command-line help.
  Two formats are currently available:\n    txt (the default) and csv.\n- balance
  assertions can be disabled with --ignore-assertions\n\nAccount aliases:\n- all matching
  account aliases are now applied, not just one directive\n  and one option\n- account
  aliases now match by case insensitive regular expressions\n  matching anywhere in
  the account name\n- account aliases can replace multiple occurrences of the pattern\n
  \ within an account name\n- an account alias replacement pattern can reference matched
  groups\n  with \\N\n\nQueries:\n- date:/date2: with a malformed date now reports
  an error instead of\n  being ignored\n- amt: now supports >= or <=\n- clarify status:
  docs and behaviour; \"*\" is no longer a synonym for\n  \"1\" (fixes #227)\n\nbalance:\n-
  fix: in tree mode, --drop is ignored instead of showing empty account names\n- a
  depth limit of 0 now shows summary items with account name \"...\",\n  instead of
  an empty report (#206)\n- in multicolumn balance reports, -E now also shows posting-less\n
  \ accounts with a non-zero balance during the period (in addition to\n  showing
  leading & trailing empty columns)\n- in multicolumn reports, multi-commodity amounts
  are rendered on one\n  line for better layout (#186)\n- multicolumn reports' title
  now includes the report span\n\nregister:\n- runs faster with large output\n- supports
  date2:, and date:/date2: combined with --date2, better (fixes\n  #201, #221, #222)\n-
  a depth limit of 0 now shows summary items (see balance)\n- -A/--average now implies
  -E/--empty\n- postings with multi-commodity amounts are now top-aligned, like\n
  \ Ledger\n\nExtra commands:\n- hledger-equity: fix end date in title; print closing
  entry too\n- hledger-check-dates: added\n\n0.23.3 (2014/9/12)\n\n- allow text 1.2+
  (#207)\n\n0.23.2 (2014/5/8)\n\n- register: also fix date sorting of postings (#184)\n\n0.23.1
  (2014/5/7)\n\n- register: fix a refactoring-related regression that the tests\n
  \ missed: if transactions were not ordered by date in the journal,\n  register could
  include postings before the report start date in the\n  output. (#184)\n- add: don't
  apply a default commodity to amounts on entry (#138)\n- cli: options before the
  add-on command name are now also passed to it (#182)\n- csv: allow the first name
  in a fields list to be empty (#178)\n- csv: don't validate fields count in skipped
  lines (#177)\n\n\n0.23 (2014/5/1)\n\nJournal format:\n- A # (hash) in column 0 is
  now also supported for starting a top-level journal comment, like Ledger.\n- The
  \"too many missing amounts\" error now reminds about the 2-space rule.\n- Fix: .
  (period) is no longer parsed as a valid amount.\n- Fix: default commodity directives
  no longer limit the maximum display precision (#169).\n- Fix: + before an amount
  is no longer parsed as part of the commodity (#181).\n\nCLI:\n- Command-line help
  cleanups, layout improvements.\n- Descriptions are shown for known add-ons in the
  command list.\n- Command aliases have been simplified.\n- Add-ons can now have any
  of these file extensions:\n  none, hs, lhs, pl, py, rb, rkt, sh, bat, com, exe.\n-
  Add-ons are displayed without their file extensions when possible.\n- Add-ons with
  the same name as a built-in command or alias are ignored.\n- Fix: add-on detection
  and invocation now works on windows.\n- Fix: add-ons with digits in the name are
  now found.\n- Fix: add-on arguments containing a single quote now work.\n- Fix:
  when -- is used to hide add-on options from the main program,\n  it is no longer
  passed through as an add-on argument.\n\nQueries:\n- The currency/commodity query
  prefix (sym:) has been renamed to cur:.\n- Currency/commodity queries are applied
  more strongly in register and\n  balance reports, filtering out unwanted currencies
  entirely. Eg\n  hledger balance cur:'\\$' now reports only the dollar amounts even
  if\n  there are multi-currency transactions or postings.\n- Amount queries like
  amt:N, amt:<N and amt:>N, where N is not 0, now do an unsigned\n  comparison of
  the amount and N. That is, they compare the absolute magnitude.\n  To do a signed
  comparison instead, write N with its sign (eg amt:+N, amt:<+N, amt:>-N).\n- Fix:
  amount queries no longer give false positives on multi-commodity amounts.\n\naccounts:\n-
  An accounts command has been added, similar to Ledger's, for listing account names\n
  \ in flat or hierarchical mode.\n\nadd:\n- Tab completion now works at all prompts,
  and will insert the default if the input area is empty.\n- Account and amount defaults
  are more robust and useful.\n- Transactions may also be completed by the enter key,
  when there are no more default postings.\n- Input prompts are displayed in a different
  colour when supported.\n\nbalance:\n- Balance reports in flat mode now always show
  exclusive (subaccount-excluding) balances.\n- Balance reports in flat mode with
  --depth now aggregate deeper accounts at the depth limit instead of excluding them.\n-
  Multicolumn reports in flat mode now support --drop.\n- Multicolumn balance reports
  can now show the account hierarchy with --tree.\n- Multicolumn report start/end
  dates are adjusted to encompass the displayed\n  report periods, so the first and
  last periods are \"full\" and comparable to the others.\n- Fix: zero-balance leaf
  accounts below a non-zero-balance parent are no longer always shown (#170).\n- Fix:
  multicolumn reports now support --date2 (cf #174).\n\nbalancesheet, cashflow, incomestatement:\n-
  These commands now support --flat and --drop.\n\nprint:\n- Tag queries (tag:) will
  now match a transaction if any of its postings match.\n\nregister:\n- The --display
  option has been dropped. To see an accurate running total which\n  includes the
  prior starting balance, use --historical/-H (like balance). \n- With a report interval,
  report start/end dates are adjusted to encompass the displayed\n  periods, so the
  first and last periods are \"full\" and comparable to the others.\n- Fix: --date2
  now works with report intervals (fixes #174).\n\nMiscellaneous:\n- Default report
  dates now derive from the secondary dates when --date2 is in effect.\n- Default
  report dates now notice any posting dates outside the transaction dates' span.\n-
  Debug output improvements.\n- New add-on example: extra/hledger-rewrite.hs, adds
  postings to matched entries.\n- Compatible with GHC 7.2 (#155) - GHC 7.8, shakespeare
  2\n\n\n0.22.2 (2014/4/16)\n\n- display years before 1000 with four digits, not three\n-
  avoid pretty-show to build with GHC < 7.4\n- allow text 1.1, drop data-pprint to
  build with GHC 7.8.x\n\n\n0.22.1 (2014/1/6) and older: see http://hledger.org/release-notes
  or doc/release-notes.md.\n"

description: ! "#  hledger\n\n## lightweight, portable, dependable accounting tools\n\nhledger
  is a computer program for easily tracking money, time, or other commodities,\non
  unix, mac and windows (and web-capable mobile devices, to some extent).\n\nIt is
  first a command-line tool, but there are also curses-style and\nweb interfaces,
  and a Haskell library\n(http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hledger-lib) for building
  your own\nprograms and scripts (hledger is written in Haskell).  hledger was\ninspired
  by and is largely compatible with Ledger.  hledger is free\nsoftware available under
  the GNU General Public License v3+.\n\nhledger aims to help both computer experts
  and regular folks\nto gain clarity and control in their finances and time management,\nbut
  currently it is a bit more suited to techies.\nI use it every day to:\n\n-   track
  spending and income\n-   see time reports by day/week/month/project\n-   get accurate
  numbers for client billing and tax filing\n-   track invoices\n\nThough limited
  in features, hledger is lightweight, usable and reliable.\nFor some, it is a simpler,
  less distracting, more future-proof alternative to Quicken or GnuCash.\n\nFor more,
  see http://hledger.org.\n\n## Support\n\n### Backers\nSupport us with a monthly
