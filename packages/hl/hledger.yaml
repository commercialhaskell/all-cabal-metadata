changelog: "<!--\n      _ _ \n  ___| (_)\n / __| | |\n| (__| | |\n \\___|_|_|\n\n-->\nUser-visible
  changes in the hledger command line tool and library.\n\n\n# 1.22.2 2021-08-07\n\nBreaking
  changes\n\n- aregister no longer hides future transactions by default.\n  This is
  a consequence of the fix for \n  [#1638](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/1638).
  \n  It makes aregister consistent, so we think it's a reasonable change.\n  So if
  you have future-dated transactions in your journal which you\n  don't want reported,
  you now must exclude them with `-e tomorrow` or\n  `date:-tomorrow` in the command,
  as with other reports.\n  (Stephen Morgan)\n\nImprovements\n\n- Timedot format's
  doc has been rewritten.\n\nFixes\n\n- Make balance assignments in forecasted transactions
  work again\n  (broken in 1.22.1).\n  Forecast transactions are now generated early
  and processed\n  in the same way as other transactions.\n  ([#1638](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/1638),
  Stephen Morgan)\n\n- aregister preserves the order of same-day transactions again\n
  \ (broken in 1.22.1).\n  ([#1642](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/1642),
  Stephen Morgan)\n\n# 1.22.1 2021-08-02\n\nImprovements\n\n- Bash shell completions
  (for hledger, hledger-ui, hledger-web) are\n  now included in the hledger package's
  release tarballs, making them\n  more likely to be installed by system packages.
  (Jakob Schöttl)\n\n- roi docs now discuss how to quote multi-word queries. (#1609,
  Dmitry\n  Astapov)\n\n- Allow megaparsec 9.1\n\nFixes\n\n- `cur:` and `amt:` queries
  now match the original amounts before\n  valuation and cost conversion, as they
  did before hledger 1.22. We\n  believe this is the more useful behaviour in practice.
  \n  (#1625, Stephen Morgan)\n\n- Queries now work better with `register --related`,
  no longer showing\n  duplicate postings when more than one posting in a transaction
  is\n  matched. \n  (#1629, Stephen Morgan)\n\n- Valuation now works with `register
  --related`. \n  (#1630, Stephen Morgan)\n\n- Auto posting rules now also see inferred
  amounts,\n  not just explicit amounts. \n  (#1412, Stephen Morgan)\n\n- The aregister
  command now properly ignores a `depth:` argument. \n  It might now also behave more
  correctly with valuation or `--txn-dates`.\n  (#1634, Stephen Morgan)\n\n- Our info
  manuals now have more robust directory metadata (no\n  subdirectory path), making
  them more likely to be linked in your\n  top-level Info directory by system packages.
  (#1594) (Simon Michael,\n  Damien Cassou)\n\n- The error message for a non-existent
  input file no longer shows\n  excess double quotes. (#1601, Stephen Morgan)\n\n-
  Journal format docs: The commodity directive's scope is now\n  correctly described
  (lasts until end of current file).\n\n# 1.22 2021-07-03\n\nFeatures\n\n- check:
  A new `balancednoautoconversion` check requires transactions\n  to balance without
  the use of inferred transaction prices. (Explicit\n  transaction prices are allowed.)
  This check is included in `--strict`\n  mode. The old `autobalanced` check has been
  renamed to\n  `balancedwithautoconversion`. (Stephen Morgan)\n\nImprovements\n\n-
  Many internal optimisations have been applied (cf hledger-lib\n  changelog). Overall,
  you can expect most reports to be about 20%\n  faster. The register report is more
  than 2x faster uses 4x less\n  memory. (Stephen Morgan)\n\n      ~/src/hledger$

  ANSI color is now disabled automatically (on stdout) when the\n  `-o/--output-file`
  option is used (with a value other than `-`).\n  (#1533)\n\n- ANSI color is now
  also available in debug output, determined in the\n  usual way by `--color`, `NO_COLOR`,
  and whether the output (stderr)\n  is interactive.\n  \n- The --version flag shows
  more details of the build, when known: git\n  tag, number of commits since the tag,
  commit hash, platform and\n  architecture. (Stephen Morgan)\n\n- balance: Capitalisation
  of \"account\" and \"total\" (and lack of a\n  colon in the latter) in CSV output
  is now consistent for single- and\n  multi-period reports.\n\n- balance reports'
  CSV output now includes full account names. (#1566)\n  (Stephen Morgan)\n\n- csv:
  We now accept spaces when parsing amounts from CSV. (Eric\n  Mertens)\n\n- json:
  Avoid adding unnecessary decimal places in JSON output. (Don't\n  increase them
  all to 10 decimal places.) (Stephen Morgan)\n  \n- json: Simplify amount precision
  (asprecision) in JSON output.\n  It is now just the number of decimal places, rather
  than an object.\n  (Stephen Morgan)\n\n- GHC 9.0 is now officially supported, and
  GHC 8.0, 8.2, 8.4 are not;\n  building hledger now requires GHC 8.6 or greater.\n\n-
  Added a now-required lower bound on containers. (#1514)\n\nFixes\n\n- Auto posting
  rules now match postings more precisely, respecting\n  `cur:` and `amt:` queries.
  (#1582) (Stephen Morgan)\n\n- balance reports: Fix empty cells when amounts are
  too wide to fit\n  (broken since 1.20) (#1526). (Stephen Morgan)\n\n- csv: Fix the
  escaping of double quotes in CSV output (broken in\n  1.21). (Stephen Morgan)\n\n-
  register: Fix the running total when there is a report interval\n  (broken since
  1.19) (#1568). (Stephen Morgan)\n\n- stats: No longer gets confused by posting dates.
  (#772) (Stephen Morgan)\n\n- timeclock: `hledger print` shows timeclock amounts
  with just 2\n  decimal places again (broken in 1.21). (#1527)\n\n- When all transaction
  amounts have the same sign, the error message\n  no longer adds an inferred price.
  (#1551) (Stephen Morgan)\n\n- Cleaned up some references to old man pages. (Felix
  Yan)\n\n# 1.21 2021-03-10\n\n## general\n\n- hledger is now generally about 10%
  more memory- and time-efficient,\n  and significantly more so in certain cases,
  eg journals with many\n  total transaction prices. (Stephen Morgan)\n\n- The `--help/-h`
  and `--version` flags are no longer position-sensitive;\n  if there is a command
  argument, they now always refer to the command\n  (where applicable).\n\n- The new
  `--info` flag opens the hledger info manual, if \"info\" is in $PATH.\n  `hledger
  COMMAND --info` will open COMMAND's info node.\n\n- The `--man` flag opens the hledger
  man page, if \"man\" is in $PATH.\n  `hledger COMMAND --man` will scroll the page
  to CMD's section, if \"less\"\n  is in $PATH. (We force the use of \"less\" in this
  case, overriding any\n  $PAGER or $MAN_PAGER setting.)\n\n- Some command aliases,
  considered deprecated, have been removed:\n  `txns`, `equity`, and the single-letter
  command aliases `a`, `b`,\n  `p`, and `r`. This was discussed at\n  https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/pull/1423
  and on the hledger\n  mail list. It might annoy some folks; please read the issue
  and do\n  follow up there if needed.\n  \n- Notable documentation updates:\n  the
  separate file format manuals have been merged into the hledger manual,\n  the topic
  hierarchy has been simplified,\n  the `balance` command docs and \"commands\" section
  have been rewritten.\n\n## valuation\n\n- Costing and valuation are now independent,
  and can be combined.\n  `--value=cost` and `--value=cost,COMM` are still supported\n
  \ (equivalent to `--cost` and `--cost --value=then,COMM` respectively), \n  but
  deprecated. (Stephen Morgan)\n\n- `-V` is now always equivalent to `--value=end`.
  (Stephen Morgan)\n\n- `--value=end` now includes market price directives as well
  as\n  transactions when choosing a valuation date for single-period\n  reports.
  (#1405, Stephen Morgan)\n\n- `--value=end` now picks a consistent valuation date
  for single- and\n  and multi-period reports. (#1424, Stephen Morgan)\n\n- `--value=then`
  is now supported with all reports, not just register. (Stephen Morgan)\n\n- The
  too-vague `--infer-value` flag has been renamed to `--infer-market-price`.\n  Tip:
  typing `--infer-market` or even `--infer` is sufficient.\n  The old spelling still
  works, but is now deprecated.\n\n## commands\n\n- add: Infix matches are now scored
  higher. If the search pattern\n  occurs in full within the other description, that
  match gets a +0.5\n  score boost.\n\n- add: `--debug` now shows transaction matching
  results, useful when\n  troubleshooting.\n\n- balance: To accomodate new report
  types, the\n  `--change|--cumulative|--historical|--budget` flags have been split\n
  \ into two groups: report type (`--sum|--budget|...`) and accumulation\n  type (`--change|--cumulative|--historical`).
  `--sum` and `--change`\n  are the defaults, and your balance commands should still
  work as\n  before. (Stephen Morgan et al, #1353)\n\n- balance: The `--valuechange`
  report type has been added, showing the\n  changes in period-end values. (Stephen
  Morgan, #1353)\n\n- balance: With `--budget`, the first and last subperiods are
  enlarged\n  to whole intervals for calculating the budget goals also. (Stephen\n
  \ Morgan)\n\n- balance: In multi-period balance reports, specifying a report period\n
  \ now also forces leading/trailing empty columns to be displayed,\n  without having
  to add `-E`. This is consistent with `balancesheet`\n  etc. (#1396, Stephen Morgan)\n\n-
  balancesheet, cashflow: declaring just a Cash account no longer\n  hides other Asset
  accounts.\n\n- check: Various improvements:\n\n  - check name arguments may be given
  as case-insensitive prefixes\n  - `accounts` and `commodities` may also be specified
  as arguments\n  - `ordereddates` now checks each file separately (#1493)\n  - `ordereddates`
  no longer supports the `--unique` flag or query arguments\n  - `payees` is a new
  check requiring payee declarations\n  - `uniqueleafnames` now gives a fancy error
  message like the others\n  - the old `checkdates`/`checkdupes` commands have been
  dropped\n\n- help: The `help` command now shows only the hledger (CLI) manual,\n
  \ its `--info/--man/--pager` flags have been renamed to `-i/-m/-p`,\n  and `--cat`
  has been dropped.\n\n- help: With a TOPIC argument (any heading or heading prefix,
  case\n  insensitive), it will open the manual positioned at this topic if\n  possible.
  (Similar to the new `--man` and `--info` flags described above.)\n  <!-- `hledger
  help print` will show `print`'s doc with the best available viewer (usually info).
  -->\n  <!-- `hledger help print -m` is equivalent to `hledger print --man`.) -->\n\n-
  payees: Add `--used`/`--declared` flags, like the `accounts` command.\n\n- print:
  Now always shows amounts with all decimal places,\n  unconstrained by commodity
  display style. This ensures more\n  parseable and sensible-looking output in more
  cases, and behaves\n  more like Ledger's print. (There may be a cosmetic issue with\n
  \ trailing zeroes.) (#931, #1465)\n\n- print: With `--match`, infix matches are
  now scored higher, as with\n  the add command.\n\n- print: `--match` now provides
  debug output useful for troubleshooting.\n\n  If you forget to give `--match` an
  argument, it can confusingly\n  consume a following flag. Eg if you write:\n\n      hledger
  print --match -x somebank   # should be: hledger print --match=somebank -x\n\n  it
  gets quietly parsed as:\n\n      hledger print --match=\"-x\"\n\n  Now you can at
  least use --debug to figure it out:\n\n      hledger print --match -x somebank --debug\n
  \     finding best match for description: \"-x\"\n      similar transactions:\n
  \     ...\n\n- roi: Now supports the valuation options (#1417), and uses commodity
  display styles.\n  Also the manual has been simplified, with some content moved
  to the Cookbook.\n  (Dmitry Astapov):\n\n## journal format\n\n- The `commodity`
  directive now properly sets the display style of the\n  no-symbol commodity. (#1461)\n\n##
  csv format\n\n- More kinds of malformed signed numbers are now ignored, in\n  particular
  just a sign without a number, which simplifies sign\n  flipping with amount-in/amount-out.\n\n##
  API\n\n- API changes include:\n  ```\n  Hledger.Cli.Utils:\n  +journalSimilarTransaction\n
  \ \n  Hledger.Cli.Commands.Add:\n   transactionsSimilarTo -> Hledger.Data.Journal.journalTransactionsSimilarTo\n
  \   and now takes a number-of-results argument\n  ```\n\n\n# 1.20.4 2021-01-29\n\n-
  aregister: ignore a depth limit, as in 1.19 (#1468).\n  In 1.20-1.20.3, aregister
  had stopped showing transactions in subaccounts \n  below a depth limit. Now it
  properly shows all subaccount transactions, \n  ensuring that the register's final
  total matches a balance report with \n  similar arguments.\n\n# 1.20.3 2021-01-14\n\n-
  When searching for price chains during valuation/currency conversion:\n\n  - It
  no longer hangs when there are price loops. (And in case of\n    future bugs, it
  will give up rather than search forever.) (#1439)\n  - It now really finds the shortest
  path. (#1443)\n  - Useful progress info is displayed with `--debug=1` or `--debug=2`.\n\n-
  balance, incomestatement: End-valued multi-period balance change\n  reports (eg:
  `bal -MV`) have been reverted to show value-of-change,\n  as in previous hledger
  versions, rather than change-of-value, for\n  now. (#1353, #1428) (Stephen Morgan)\n\n-
  balance: End-valued balance change reports now choose the same final\n  valuation
  date and show consistent results whether single-period or\n  multi-period. (#1424)
  (Stephen Morgan)\n\n- balance: the `--drop` option now works with `csv` and `html`
  output.\n  (#1456) (Ilya Konovalov)\n\n- check: the `commodities` check, and `-s`/`--strict`
  mode, now ignore\n  the \"AUTO\" internal pseudo-commodity. (#1419) (Ilya Konovalov)\n\n-
  register: Then-valued multi-period register reports\n  (eg: `register -M --value=then`)
  now calculate the correct values.\n  (#1449) (Stephen Morgan)\n\n- roi: now shows
  a better error message when required prices are\n  missing. (#1446) (Dmitry Astapov)\n\n-
  The no-symbol commodity's input number format can now be set by a\n  `commodity`
  directive, like other commodities. (#1461)\n\n# 1.20.2 2020-12-28\n\n- help: Fix
  loss of capitalisation in part of the hledger-ui manual. \n\n- Fix the info manuals'
  node structure.\n\n- Drop unused parsec dependency.\n\n# 1.20.1 2020-12-15\n\n-
  bal, bs, cf, is: In amount-sorted balance reports, equal-balance accounts \n  are
  now reliably sorted by name. (Simon Michael, Stephen Morgan)\n\n- help: Fix the
  topic hierarchy in Info manuals.\n\n# 1.20 2020-12-05\n\n## general\n\n- strict
  mode: with -s/--strict, hledger requires that\n  all accounts and commodities are
  declared with directives.\n\n- Reverted a stripAnsi change in 1.19.1 that caused
  a 3x slowdown of amount rendering\n  in terminal reports. (#1350)\n\n- Amount and
  table rendering has been improved, so that stripAnsi is no longer needed.\n  This
  speeds up amount rendering in the terminal, speeding up some reports by 10% or more
  since 1.19.\n  (Stephen Morgan)\n\n- Amount eliding no longer displays corrupted
  ANSI codes (#1352, Stephen Morgan)\n\n- Eliding of multicommodity amounts now makes
  better use of available space,\n  avoiding unnecessary eliding (showing as many
  amounts as possible within\n  32 characters). (Stephen Morgan)\n\n- Command line
  help for --no-elide now mentions that it also disables eliding of\n  multicommodity
  amounts.\n\n- Query terms containing quotes (eg to match account names containing
  quotes)\n  now work properly. (#1368, Stephen Morgan)\n\n- cli, journal: Date range
  parsing is more robust, fixing failing/incorrect cases such as: (Stephen Morgan)\n\n
  \ - a hyphenated range with just years (`2017-2018`)\n  - a hyphenated date with
  no day in a hyphenated range (`2017-07-2018`)\n  - a dotted date with no day in
  a dotted range (`2017.07..2018.02`)\n \n- Debug output is prettier (eg, in colour),
  using pretty-simple instead of pretty-show.\n\n- csv, timedot, timeclock files now
  respect command line --alias options,\n  like journal files.  (#859)\n\n- Market
  price lookup for value reports is now more robust, fixing several bugs\n  (and debug
  output is more informative).\n  There has been a slight change in functionality:
  when chaining prices,\n  we now prefer chains of all \"forward\" prices, even if
  longer, with chains\n  involving reverse prices being the last resort.\n  (#1402)\n\n##
  commands\n\n- add: number style (eg thousands separators) no longer disturbs the
  value\n  that is offered as default. (#1378)\n\n- bal: --invert now affects -S/--sort-amount,
  reversing the order. (#1283, #1379) (Stephen Morgan)\n\n- bal: --budget reports
  no longer insert an extra space inside the brackets. (Stephen Morgan)\n\n- bal:
  --budget reports now support CSV output (#1155)\n\n- bal, is, bs --change: \n  Valued
  multiperiod balance change reports now show changes of value, \n  rather than the
  value of changes. (#1353, Stephen Morgan)\n\n- bal: clearer debug output, following
  debug levels policy\n\n- check: A new command which consolidating the various check-*
  commands.\n  It runs the default, strict, or specified checks and produces\n  no
  output and a zero exit code if all is well.\n\n- check-dates: this command is deprecated
  and will be removed\n  in next release; use \"hledger check ordereddates\" instead.\n\n-
  check-dupes: this command is deprecated and will be removed\n  in next release;
  use \"hledger check uniqueleafnames\" instead.\n\n- import: The journal's commodity
  styles (declared or inferred) are now applied\n  to imported amounts, overriding
  their original number format.\n\n- roi: TWR now handles same-day pnl changes and
  cashflows,\n  calculation failure messages have been improved, and\n  the documentation
  includes more detail and examples.\n  (#1398) (Dmitry Astapov)\n\n## journal format\n\n-
  The journal's commodity styles are now applied to forecasted transactions. (#1371)\n\n-
  journal, csv: commodity style is now inferred from the first amount, as documented,\n
  \ not the last. This was \"working wrongly\" since hledger 1.12..\n\n- A zero market
  price no longer causes \"Ratio has zero denominator\" error\n  in valued reports.
  (#1373)\n\n## csv format\n\n- The new `decimal-mark` rule allows reliable number
  parsing\n  when CSV numbers contain digit group marks (eg thousands separators).\n\n-
  The CSV reader's verbose \"assignment\" debug output is now at level 9.\n\n\n# 1.19.1
  2020-09-07\n\n- Fix alignment of coloured numbers (#1345, #1349, Stephen Morgan)\n\n-
  Fix a regression in account type autodetection for accounts with\n  capitalised
  names. (#1341)\n\n- Allow megaparsec 9\n\n# 1.19 2020-09-01\n\n## general\n\n- When
  parsing dates, the year is now required to have at least four\n  digits. So eg we
  no longer accept `200/1/1` as a valid date, it\n  would need to be written `0200/1/1`.
  This was done for.. reasons,\n  and is experimental; let us know if it causes you
  trouble.\n\n- The --color/--colour=WHEN command line option, support for the\n  NO_COLOR
  environment variable, and smarter autodetection of colour\n  terminals have been
  added (#1296)\n\n- Command line options taking a numeric argument are now validated\n
  \ more carefully, preventing issues with unexpected negatives or Int\n  overflow.
  (Stephen Morgan)\n\n- In queries, you can now specify a quarter like `2020q1` or
  `q4`\n  (the q is case-insensitive). (#1247, Henning Thieleman, Stephen Morgan)\n\n-
  In report intervals, `fortnightly` has been added as a synonym for\n  `biweekly`.
  (Stephen Morgan)\n\n- -t and -l command line flags have been added as short forms
  of\n  --tree and --flat (#1286)\n\n- All reports displaying accounts now choose
  flat mode by default\n  (Stephen Morgan)\n\n- Reports now show at most 2 commodities
  of multicommodity amounts,\n  unless the --no-elide flag is used. This helps keep
  them readable by\n  default, since multicolumn, multicommodity balance reports otherwise\n
  \ tend to become very wide, especially in tree mode.\n\n- Numbers with more than
  255 decimal places, which we do not support,\n  now give an error instead of silently
  misparsing. (#1326)\n\n- Digit groups are now limited to at most 255 digits each.
  (#1326)\n\n- Account aliases (on command line or in journal) containing a bad\n
  \ regular expression now give a more detailed error message.\n\n- A tab character
  could get parsed as part of a commodity symbol, with\n  confusing results. This
  no longer happens. (#1301, Dmitry Astapov)\n\n- Debug output is now organised better
  by debug level.\n  The levels are:\n\n  0. normal command output only (no warnings)\n
  \ 1. useful warnings & most common troubleshooting info (valuation, eg)\n  2. common
  troubleshooting info, more detail\n  3. report options selection\n  4. report generation\n
  \ 5. report generation, more detail\n  6. input file reading\n  7. input file reading,
  more detail\n  8. command line parsing\n  9. any other rarely needed or more in-depth
  info\n\n- Added a missing lower bound for aeson, making cabal installs more\n  reliable.
  (#1268)\n\n- lib: parseAmountQueryTerm: allow whitespace around arg parts (#1312)\n
  \ Whitespace around the operator, sign, or number is now tolerated.\n\n## commands\n\n-
  account,bal,bs,cf,is: --drop now also works in tree mode (Stephen Morgan)\n\n- add:
  fix an error in the command line help (arguments are inputs,\n  not a query)\n\n-
  aregister: a new command showing a transaction-oriented account\n  register, like
  hledger-ui, hledger-web, or your bank statement. \n  Each line represents a whole
  transaction in one account, unlike\n  the register command which shows individual
  postings possibly from\n  multiple accounts. You might prefer aregister when reconciling\n
  \ real-world asset/liability accounts, and register when reviewing\n  detailed revenues/expenses.
  (#1294)\n\n- bal,bs,cf,is: boring parents are now elided by default in tabular\n
  \ balance reports too, like single-column reports. (Stephen Morgan)\n\n- bal,bs,cf,is:
  monthly column headings are no longer elided to just\n  the short month name, if
  multiple years are being displayed.\n\n- bal --budget's column headings are now
  end dates rather than\n  periods when appropriate (ie with --cumulative or --historical).\n\n-
  bs,cf,is: -%/--no-total no longer forces --no-total (Stephen Morgan)\n\n- bs,cf,is:
  --no-total now hides subtotals as well as the grand total\n  (Stephen Morgan)\n\n-
  codes: a new command for listing transaction codes\n\n- print: a new `sql` output
  format has been added (Dmitry Astapov)\n\n- roi: errors are now shown without a
  call stack\n\n- tags: add --parsed flag, hide empties without --empty. With the\n
  \ --parsed flag, all tags or values are shown in the order they are\n  parsed from
  the input data, including duplicates. With -E/--empty,\n  any blank/empty values
  will also be shown, otherwise they are\n  omitted.\n\n## journal format\n\n- account
  directives can specify a new `Cash` account type. This is a\n  subtype of `Asset`,
  denoting accounts which should be displayed\n  in `cashflow` reports. \n  \n- The
  built-in regular expressions for choosing default account types\n  have been tweaked,
  and documentation for account types has been\n  improved.\n\n## csv format\n\n-
  Inferring the appropriate default field separator based on file\n  extension (,
  for .csv, ; for .ssv, \\t for .tsv) now works as\n  documented.\n\n- Conditional
  rule patterns can now be grouped with the `&` (AND) operator,\n  allowing more powerful
  matching. (Michael Sanders)\n\n- Invalid csv rules files now give clearer parse
  error messages.\n  (Dmitry Astapov)\n\n- \"If tables\", a compact bulk format for
  conditional rules, have been\n  added. (Dmitry Astapov)\n\n- csv conversion with
  a lot of conditional rules is now faster (Dmitry Astapov)\n\n\n# 1.18.1 2020-06-21\n\n-
  journal: document recursive wildcards\n\n- by default, value reports work as in
  1.17; to infer market prices from\n  transactions, add the new --infer-value flag.
  (#1239, #1253)\n\n- organise debug output better\n\n- print: amounts in csv output
  now have commodity symbol, digit group\n  separators and prices removed (Dmitry
  Astapov)\n\n\n# 1.18 2020-06-07\n\n## General\n\n- The --forecast flag now takes
  an optional argument\n  (--forecast=PERIODICEXPR), allowing periodic transactions
  to\n  start/end on any date and to overlap recorded transactions.\n  (#835, #1236)
  (Dmitry Astapov)\n\n- An upper case file extension no longer confuses file format\n
  \ detection. (#1225)\n\n- In the commands list, redundant source scripts are now
  hidden\n  properly when a corresponding .com/.exe file exists. (#1225)\n\n- We now
  show `..` instead of `-` to indicate date ranges, eg in\n  report titles, to stand
  out more from hyphenated dates. \n  (Stephen Morgan)\n  \n- Period expressions (eg
  in -p, date:, and periodic rules) now accept\n  `to`, `until`, `-`, or `..` as synonyms.
  (Stephen Morgan)\n\n- When parsing amounts, whitespace between sign and number is
  now allowed.\n\n- A clearer error message is shown on encountering a malformed regular\n
  \ expression.\n\n## commands\n\n- commands allowing different output formats now
  list their supported\n  formats accurately in --help (#689)\n\n- commands allowing
  JSON output now actually produce JSON (#689)\n\n- bal, bs: show .. (not ,,) in report
  titles, like other reports\n\n## journal format\n\n- We now also infer market prices
  from transactions, like Ledger.\n  See https://hledger.org/hledger.html#market-prices
  (#1239). \n  \n  Upgrade note: this means value reports (-V, -X etc.) can give\n
  \ different output compared to hledger 1.17. If needed, you can\n  prevent this
  by adding a P directive declaring the old price, on or\n  after the date of the
  transaction causing the issue.\n\n- The include directive now accepts a file format
  prefix, like the\n  -f/--file option. This works with glob patterns too, applying
  the\n  prefix to each path. This can be useful when included files don't\n  have
  the standard file extension, eg:\n\n      include timedot:2020*.md\n\n- We now accept
  (and ignore) Ledger-style lot dates\n  (`[DATE]`) and four lot price forms (`{PRICE}`,
  `{{PRICE}}`,\n  `{=PRICE}`, `{{=PRICE}}`), anywhere after the posting amount but\n
  \ before any balance assertion.\n\n- We now accept Ledger-style parenthesised \"virtual
  posting\n  costs\" (`(@)`, `(@@)`). In hledger these are equivalent to the\n  unparenthesised
  form.\n\n- The unbalanced transaction error message is clearer, especially when\n
  \ postings all have the same sign, and is split into multiple lines\n  for readability.\n\n##
  csv format\n\n- You can now generate up to 99 postings in a transaction. (Vladimir
  Sorokin)\n\n- You can now generate postings with an explicit 0 amount. (#1112)\n\n-
  For each posting, when both numbered and unnumbered amount\n  assignments are active
  (eg: both `amount` and `amount1`), we ignore\n  the unnumbered ones. This makes
  it easier to override old `amount`\n  rules.\n  \n- Fix a 1.17.1 regression involving
  amount-in/amount-out. (#1226)\n\n- Assigning too many non-zero or zero values to
  a posting amount now\n  gives a clearer error. (#1226)\n\n\n# 1.17.1.1 2020-03-19\n\n-
  update bounds after some belated hledger-* version bumps\n\n# 1.17.1 2020-03-19\n\n-
  csv: amount1 no longer forces a second posting or second posting amount.\n  The
  \"special handling for pre 1.17 rules\" should now be less\n  noticeable. amount1/amount2
  no longer force a second posting or\n  explicit amounts on both postings. (Only
  amount/amount-in/amount-out\n  do that.) Error messages and handling of corner cases
  may be more\n  robust, also.\n\n- journal: a commodity directive without decimal
  mark now gives a more\n  verbose error message with examples\n\n- journal: inclusive
  balance assignments now work (#1207)\n\n- require newer Decimal, math-functions
  libs to ensure consistent\n  rounding behaviour, even when built with old GHCs/snapshots.
  \n  hledger uses banker's rounding (rounds to nearest even number, eg\n  0.5 displayed
  with zero decimal places is \"0\").\n\n# 1.17 2020-03-01\n\n## General\n\n- hledger's
  default date format is now YYYY-MM-DD (ISO-8601 dates).\n  (Brian Wignall, Jakob
  Schöttl, Simon Michael)\n\n- Drop the file format auto-detection feature.\n\n  For
  a long time hledger has auto-detected the file format when it's\n  not known, eg
  when reading from a file with unusual extension (like\n  .dat or .txt), or from
  standard input (-f-), or when using the\n  include directive (which currently ignores
  file extensions).  This\n  was done by trying all readers until one succeeded.  This
  worked\n  well in practice. But recent changes to timedot format have made\n  this
  kind of auto-detection unreliable. (timedot and journal formats\n  overlap).\n\n
  \ For predictability and to minimise confusion, hledger will no longer\n  guess;
  when there's no file extension or reader prefix available, it\n  always assumes
  journal format.\n\n  To specify one of the other formats, you must use its standard
  file\n  extension (`.timeclock`, `.timedot`, `.csv`, `.ssv`, `.tsv`), or a\n  reader
  prefix (`-f csv:foo.txt`, `-f timedot:-`).\n\n  Experimental, feedback welcome.\n\n-
  Fix extra $ symbol (Mateus Furquim)\n\n- --output-format now rejects invalid formats\n\n-
  Numbers in JSON output now provide a floating point Number\n  representation as
  well as our native Decimal object representation,\n  since the later can sometimes
  contain 255-digit integers. The\n  floating point numbers can have up to 10 decimal
  digits (and an\n  unbounded number of integer digits.)\n  Experimental, suggestions
  needed. (#1195)\n\n- Fix finding latest date in queryEndDate Or queries and simplify\n
  \ date comparison code. (Stephen Morgan)\n\n- Fix issue 457. (Jacek Generowicz)\n
  \ Issue #457 pointed out that commands such as\n\n      hledger ui 'amt:>200'\n\n
  \ failed. This was because the process of dispatching from `hledger ui`\n  to `hledger-ui`
  (note addition of `-`) lost the quotes around\n  `amt:>20` and the `>` character
  was interpreted as a shell redirection\n  operator, rather than as part of the argument.\n\n
  \ The machinery for quoting or escaping arguments which contain\n  characters which
  require quoting or escaping (thus far whitespace and\n  quotes) already existed.
  This solution simply adds shell stdio\n  redirection characters to this set.\n\n##
  commands\n\n- add: you can use `<` to undo and redo previous inputs (Gaith Hallak)\n\n-
  bs, cf, is, bal, print, reg: support json output\n\n- bs, cf, is: fix excess subreport
  columns in csv output\n\n- bs, cf, is, bal: fix an issue with border intersections
  in\n  --pretty-tables output. (Eric Mertens)\n\n- close: fix a rounding bug that
  could generate unbalanced transactions. (#1164)\n\n- close: hide cost prices by
  default, show them with --show-costs.\n  close no longer preserves costs (transaction
  prices) unless you ask\n  it to, since that can generate huge entries when there
  are many\n  foreign currency/investment transactions. (#1165)\n\n- close: equity
  amounts are omitted by default, for simpler entries;\n  -x/--explicit shows them
  (usually causing more postings). (#1165)\n\n- close: --interleaved generates equity
  postings alongside each closed\n  account, making troubleshooting easier.\n\n- close:
  \"equity:opening/closing balances\" is now the default\n  closing and opening account.\n\n-
  close: --close-desc/--open-desc customise the closing/opening\n  transaction descriptions.
  (#1165)\n\n- close: some --open*/--close* flags have been simplified for memorability:\n\n
  \ --closing -> --close\n  --opening -> --open\n  --close-to -> --close-acct\n  --open-from
  -> --open-acct\n\n  The old flags are accepted as hidden aliases, and deprecated.
  (#1165)\n\n- print, register: a new valuation type, --value=then, shows the\n  market
  value at each posting's date.\n\n- print: -V/-X/--value now imply -x/--explicit,
  as -B/--cost does.\n  This avoids a bug where print -V of a transaction with an
  implicit\n  commodity conversion would convert only some of its postings to value.\n\n##
  journal format\n\n- The include directive no longer tries all readers.  It now picks\n
  \ just one, based on the included file's extension, defaulting to\n  journal.  (It
  doesn't yet handle a reader prefix.)\n\n- The default commodity (D) directive now
  limits display precision too. (#1187)\n  D directives are now fully equivalent to
  commodity directives for\n  setting a commodity's display style. (Previously it
  couldn't limit\n  the number of decimal places.)  When both kinds of directive exist,\n
  \ commodity directives take precedence.  When there are multiple D\n  directives
  in the journal, only the last one affects display style.\n\n## csv format\n\n- Conditional
  blocks can now match single fields. \\o/\n\n- The experimental --separator command
  line option has been dropped,\n  replaced a new `separator` directive in CSV rule
  files. (Aleksandar Dimitrov)\n  Also the `.tsv` and `.ssv` file extensions are now
  recognised,\n  and set the default `separator` to TAB and semicolon respectively.\n
  \ (#1179)\n\n- Allow manual assignment of the \"expenses:unknown\" account name.
  (#1192)\n\n- CSV rule keywords are now case insensitive. (Aleksandar Dimitrov)\n\n##
  timeclock format\n\n- Misc. fixes making parsing more robust. (Jakob Schöttl)\n\n##
  timedot format\n\n- More support for org mode: org headlines can now be used for
  date\n  lines and timelog items (the stars are ignored). Also, any org\n  headlines
  before the first date line are ignored.\n\n- You can now write a description after
  a date, which will be used in\n  all of that day's transactions.\n\n\n# 1.16.2 2020-01-14\n\n-
  add support for megaparsec 8 (#1175)\n \n- close: mention --close-to/--open-from
  in docs\n \n# 1.16.1 2019-12-03\n\n- Drop unnecessary mtl-compat dependency\n\n-
  Fix building with GHC 8.0, 8.2\n\n# 1.16 2019-12-01\n\n## General\n\n- add support
  for GHC 8.8, base-compat 0.11 (#1090)\n\n- drop support for GHC 7.10\n\n- The benchmark
  suite has been disabled.\n\n- The --anon flag now also anonymises transaction codes
  and account\n  names declared with account directives. (Mykola Orliuk) (#901)\n\n##
  commands\n\n- balance/bs/cf/is: balance commands now support the -%/--percent flag\n
  \ to show amounts as percentages of the column's total. (Michael Kainer)\n\n  If
  there are multiple commodities involved in a report hledger bails\n  with an error
  message. This can be avoided by using -B/--cost. Also note\n  that if one uses -%
  with the balance command the chances are high that\n  all numbers are 0. This is
  due to the fact that by default balance sums\n  up to zero. If one wants to use
  -% in a meaningful way with balance one\n  has to add a query.\n\n  In order to
  keep the implementation as simple as possible --tree has no\n  influence over how
  the percentages are calculated, i.e., the percentages\n  always represent the fraction
  of the columns total. If one wants to know\n  the percentages relative to a parent
  account, one has to use a query to\n  narrow down the accounts.\n\n- balance: --budget
  no longer errors when there is neither budget nor\n  transactions in the report
  period (Dmitry Astapov)\n\n- balance: --budget has improved debug output (shows
  budget txns)\n  (Dmitry Astapov)\n\n- check-dates: now sets the exit status code
  (Amitai Burstein)\n\n- close: no longer strips zeroes after the decimal mark, and
  preserves\n  parseable output (#1137)\n\n- close: the --close-to, --open-from options
  allow closing/opening\n  account names to be chosen\n\n- import: create the journal
  if missing, like the add command\n  Streamlines import/migration instructions.\n\n-
  import: --catchup marks all transactions imported, without importing\n\n- import:
  more informative output: mention the input files, also show\n  a message when nothing
  was imported\n\n- prices: show price amounts with proper display style; always show\n
  \ full precision\n\n- roi: don't give an error with empty input data (Dmitry Astapov)\n\n-
  tests: unit tests are now run by tasty, and show coloured output by default (#1090).\n
  \ Test running options have changed, see the command help. \n  Some unit tests have
  been collapsed, so the reported test count has\n  dropped a little.\n\n## journal
  format\n\n- Fixed: wrong dates generated by certain periodic transaction rules,\n
  \ eg \"~ every 12 months from 2019/04\". (Dmitry Astapov) (#1085)\n\n## csv format\n\nCSV
  conversion is now more powerful (#1095, Dmitry Astapov, Simon Michael):\n\n- A variable
  number of postings can be generated, from zero to nine. (#627, #1095)\n\n- In conditional
  blocks, `skip` can be used to skip one or more\n  records after a pattern match,
  or the new `end` rule can be used to\n  skip all remaining records. (#1076)\n\n-
  The new `balance-type` CSV rule controls which kind of balance\n  assertions are
  generated (=, ==, =*, ==*)\n\n- Postings with balance assignments can be generated.
  (#1000)\n\n- Both the amount-in/amount-out fields having a non-empty value is now\n
  \ accepted, as long as one of them is zero. (#570)\n\n- Line feeds/carriage returns
  in (quoted) CSV values are now converted\n  to spaces during conversion. (#416,
  #841)\n\n- Field assignments can now unset a field (eg a posting can be\n  suppressed
  by assigning no value to its account).\n\n- CSV records with varying lengths are
  now allowed; short records will\n  be padded with empty fields as needed. This allows
  us to handle eg\n  exported Google spreadsheets, where trailing empty fields are
  omitted.\n\n- Journals generated from CSV are now finalised and checked like\n  ordinary
  journals (#1000). So invalid transactions generated from\n  CSV will be rejected,
  amount styles will be standardised etc.\n\n- Fixed: we no longer add an extra (third)
  space between description and comment.\n\n- Fixed: whitespace on the line after
  an if block no longer causes misparsing. (#1120)\n\n- Fixed: an empty field assignment
  no longer consumes the next line. (#1001)\n\n- Fixed: interpolation of field names
  containing punctuation now works.\n\n- Docs have been rewritten and clarified.\n\nMigration
  notes:\n\n- When `print`ing from CSV, there is now one less space between\n  transaction
  descriptions and comments, which may generate noisy\n  diffs if you are comparing
  old and new reports. diff -w\n  (--ignore-all-space) will filter these out.\n\n-
  CSV rules now give you more freedom to generate any journal\n  entries you want,
  including malformed or unbalanced ones. \n  The csv reader now checks the journal
  after conversion,\n  so it will report any problems with the generated entries.\n\n-
  Balance assertions generated from CSV are not checked, currently.\n  This is appropriate
  when you are downloading partial CSV data to\n  be merged into your main journal.
  If you do need to check balance\n  assertions right away, you can pipe through hledger
  again:\n\n      $ hledger -f a.csv print | hledger -f- print\n\n\n\n# 1.15.2 2019-09-05\n\n-
  -V and -X now respect a report end date (set with -e or -p or date:)\n  when choosing
  the valuation date (which determines the market prices\n  used). This is how -V
  works in hledger 1.14 and Ledger, and it means\n  that -V isn't exactly equivalent
  to either --value=end or\n  --value=now. Possibly some other corner cases in valuation
  have been\n  fixed as well. \"Effect of --value on reports\" in the hledger manual\n
  \ has been updated and is more accurate.\n\n# 1.15.1 2019-09-02\n\n- add commodities,
  descriptions, diff, notes, payees commands to manual\n\n# 1.15 2019-09-01\n\n##
  General\n\n- There is a new valuation option `--value=TYPE[,COMM]`, with\n  backwards-compatible
  `-B/--cost`, `-V/--market`, `-X/--exchange=COMM`\n  variants. These provide control
  over valuation date (#329), and\n  inference of indirect market prices (similar
  to Ledger's -X) (#131).\n  Experimental.\n  \n- Market valuation (-V/-X/--value)
  is now much faster (#999):\n\n      +-------------------------------------------++--------------+--------------+\n

  How date options like `-M` and `-p` interact has been updated and clarified.\n  (Jakob
  Schöttl) (#1008, #1009, #1011)\n\n- Restore `--aux-date` and `--effective` as `--date2`
  aliases (#1034).\n  These Ledger-ish spellings were dropped over the years, to improve\n
  \ `--help`'s layout. Now we support them again, as semi-hidden flags\n  (`--help`
  doesn't list them, but they are mentioned in `--date2`'s help).\n\n## commands\n\n-
  add, web: on Windows, trying to add transactions to a file path\n  containing trailing
  periods (eg `hledger add -f  Documents.\\.hledger.journal`) \n  now gives an error,
  since this could cause data loss otherwise (#1056).\n  This affects the add command
  and hledger-web's add form.\n\n- bal: --budget: don't always convert to cost.\n\n-
  bal: --budget: don't show a percentage when budgeted and actual\n  amounts are in
  different commodities.\n\n- bal/bs/bse: `-H/--historical` or `--cumulative` now
  disables `-T/--row-total` (#329).\n  Multiperiod balance reports which show end
  balances (eg, `bal -MH` or `bs -M`)\n  no longer show a Totals column, since summing
  end balances generally\n  doesn't make sense.\n\n- bs: show end date(s) in title,
  not transactions date span (#1078)\n  Compound balance reports showing ending balances
  (eg balancesheet),\n  now show the ending date (single column) or range of ending\n
  \ dates (multi column) in their title. ,, (double comma) is used\n  rather than
  - (hyphen) to suggest a sequence of discrete dates\n  rather than a continuous span.\n\n-
  close: preserve transaction prices (costs) accurately (#1035).\n  The generated
  closing/opening transactions were collapsing/misreporting\n  the costs in balances
  involving multiple costs.\n  Now, each separately-priced amount gets its own posting.\n
  \ (And only the last of these (for each commodity) gets a balance assertion.)\n
  \ Also the equity posting's amount is now always shown explicitly, \n  which in
  multicommodity situations means that multiple equity postings are shown. \n  The
  upshot is that a balance -B report will be unchanged after\n  the closing & opening
  transactions generated by the close command.\n\n- descriptions, payees, notes commands
  added (Caleb Maclennan)\n\n- diff: Gabriel Ebner's hledger-diff is now a built in
  command,\n  and https://github.com/gebner/hledger-diff is deprecated.\n\n- help:
  don't require a journal file\n\n- print: now also canonicalises the display style
  of balance assertion amounts (#1042)\n\n- reg: show negative amounts in red, like
  balance and Ledger\n\n- reg: fix `--average`, broken since 1.12 (#1003)\n\n- stats:
  show count of market prices (P directives), and the commodities covered\n\n- tags:
  add --values flag to list tag values.\n\n- tags: now runs much faster when there
  many tags\n\n## journal format\n\n- Transactions and postings generated/modified
  by periodic transaction\n  rules and/or transaction modifier rules are now marked
  with tags\n  (`generated-transaction`, `generated-posting`, `modified`) for\n  easier
  troubleshooting and filtering.\n\n## csv format\n\n- When interpolating CSV values,
  outer whitespace is now stripped.\n  This removes a potential snag in amount field
  assignments (#1051),\n  and hopefully is harmless and acceptable otherwise.\n\n-
  We no longer add inter-field spaces in CSV error messages.\n  Some CSV errors would
  show the problem record, eg:\n\n      2000-01-01,a,\"1\"\n  \n  with extra spaces
  added, eg:\n\n      the CSV record is: \"2000-01-01\", \"a\", \"1\"\n\n  which was
  inaccurate and not valid RFC-4180 CSV format.\n\n- CSV parse errors are human-readable
  again (broken since 1.11) (#1038)\n\n- CSV rules now allow the amount to be unassigned,
  if there is an\n  assignment to \"balance\" (generating a balance assignment in
  this\n  case). (#1000)\n\n\n# 1.14.2 2019-03-20\n\n- require easytest <0.3 to fix

  1.13 (2019/02/01)\n\n- cli: reorganised commands list. Addons now have a + prefix.\n\n-
  cli: the command line help and manual section for all hledger's\n  commands are
  now consistent, and generated from the same source.\n\n- cli: comprehensive bash
  completion support is now provided (in\n  shell-completion/). See how-to in the
  Cookbook. (Jakob Schöttl)\n\n- balance --budget: budget amounts now aggregate hierarchically,
  like\n  account balances. Unbudgeted accounts can be shown with -E/--empty\n  (along
  with zero-balance accounts), and the --show-budgeted flag has\n  been dropped.  (Dmitry
  Astapov)\n\n- balance: new --transpose flag switches the rows and columns of\n  tabular
  balance reports (in txt and csv output formats). (Dmitry\n  Astapov)\n\n- close:
  generated balance assertions now have exact amounts with all\n  decimal digits,
  ignoring display precision. Also, balance assertion\n  amounts will no longer contain
  prices. (#941, #824, #958)\n\n- files: now shows up in the commands list\n\n- import:
  be silent when there's nothing to import\n\n- roi: percentages smaller than 0.01%
  are displayed as zero (Dmitry\n  Astapov)\n\n- stats, ui: correct file order is
  preserved when using --auto (#949)\n\n- journal: account directive: the account
  name can now be followed by\n  a comment on the same line\n\n- journal: account
  directive: account types for the bs/bse/cf/is\n  commands can now be set with a
  `type:` tag, whose value is `Asset`,\n  `Liability`, `Equity`, `Revenue`, `Expense`,
  `A`, `L`, `E`, `R` or\n  `X` (case-insensitive).  The previous syntax (`account
  assets A`) is\n  now deprecated.\n\n- journal: account directive: account sort codes
  like `account 1000`\n  (introduced in 1.9, deprecated in 1.11) are no longer supported.\n\n-
  journal: transaction modifiers (auto postings) can affect periodic\n  transactions
  (--auto can add postings to transactions generated with\n  --forecast). (Dmitry
  Astapov)\n\n- journal: balance assertion errors now show exact amounts with all\n
  \ decimal digits.  Previously it was possible, in case of a commodity\n  directive
  limiting the display precision, to have a balance\n  assertion error with asserted
  and actual amounts looking the\n  same. (#941)\n\n- journal: fixed a periodic transaction
  parsing failure (#942) (Dmitry\n  Astapov)\n\n# 1.12.1 (2018/12/03)\n\n-   roi:
  use math-functions lib instead of statistics,\n    be more stackage nightly compatible\n\n#
  1.12 (2018/12/02)\n\n-   install script: ensure a new-enough version of stack; more
  informative output\n\n-   build with GHC 8.6/base-4.12 (Peter Simons)\n\n-   add
  required upper bound for statistics (Samuel May)\n\n-   --anon anonymises more thoroughly
  (including linked original postings) (Moritz Kiefer)\n\n-   unbalanced transaction
  errors now include location info (Mykola Orliuk)\n\n-   accounts command: --drop
  also affects the default flat output, without needing an explicit --flat flag\n\n-
  \  accounts command: the --codes flag has been dropped\n\n-   accounts command:
  filtering by non-account-name queries now works\n\n-   add command: fix transaction
  rendering regression during data entry and in journal file\n\n-   balance command:
  fix wrongful eliding of zero-balance parent accounts in tree mode (Dmitry Astapov)\n\n-
  \  journal format, bs/bse/cf/is commands: account directives can declare account
  types (#877)\n    Previously you had to use one of the standard english account
  names\n    (assets, liabilities..) for top-level accounts, if you wanted them to\n
  \   appear in the right place in the balancesheet, balancesheetequity,\n    cashflow
  or incomestatement reports.\n\n    Now you can use your preferred account names,
  and use account directives\n    to declare which accounting class (Asset, Liability,
  Equity, Revenue or\n    eXpense) an account (and its subaccounts) belongs to, by
  writing one of\n    the letters A, L, E, R, X after the account name, after two
  or more\n    spaces. This syntax may change (see issue). Experimental.\n\n    Currently
  we allow unlimited account type declarations anywhere in the\n    account tree.
  So you could declare a liability account somewhere under\n    assets, and maybe
  a revenue account under that, and another asset account\n    even further down.
  In such cases you start to see oddities like accounts\n    appearing in multiple
  places in a tree-mode report. I have left it this\n    way for now in case it helps
  with, eg, modelling contra accounts, or\n    combining multiple files each with
  their own account type\n    declarations. (In that scenario, if we only allowed
  type declarations on\n    top-level accounts, or only allowed a single account of
  each type,\n    complications seem likely.)\n\n-   journal format: periodic transaction
  rules now require a double space separator.\n    In periodic transaction rules which
  specify a transaction description or\n    same-line transaction comment, this must
  be separated from the period\n    expression by two or more spaces, to prevent ambiguous
  parsing. Eg\n    this will parse correctly as \"monthly\" thanks to the double space:\n\n
  \       ~ monthly  In 2020 we'll end this monthly transaction.\n\n-   journal format:
  exact/complete balance assertions (Samuel May).\n    A stronger kind of balance
  assertion, written with a double equals sign,\n    asserts an account's complete
  account balance, not just the balance in\n    one commodity. (But only if it is
  a single-commodity balance, for now.)\n    Eg:\n\n        1/1\n          (a)  A
  1\n          (a)  B 1\n          (a)  0   =  A 1   ; commodity A balance assertion,
  succeeds\n          (a)  0   == A 1   ; complete balance assertion, fails\n\n-   journal
  format: account directives now allow whitespace or a comment after the account name\n\n-
  \  journal format: using \\~ for home directory in include directives now works
  (#896) (Mykola Orliuk)\n\n-   journal format: prevent misleading parse error messages
  with cyclic include directives (#853) (Alex Chen)\n\n-   journal format: transaction
  modifier multipliers handle total-priced amounts correctly (#928).\n    Multipliers
  (*N) in transaction modifier rules did not multiply\n    total-priced amounts properly.
  Now the total prices are also multiplied,\n    keeping the transaction balanced.\n\n-
  \  journal format: do amount inference/balance assignments/assertions before transaction
  modifiers (#893, #908) (Jesse Rosenthal)\n    Previously, transaction modifier (auto
  postings) rules were applied\n    before missing amounts were inferred. This meant
  amount multipliers could\n    generate too many missing-amount postings, making
  the transaction\n    unbalanceable (#893).\n\n    Now, missing amount inference
  (and balance assignments, and balance\n    assertions, which are interdependent)
  are done earlier, before\n    transaction modifier rules are applied (#900, #903).\n\n
  \   Also, we now disallow the combination of balance assignments and\n    transaction
  modifier rules which both affect the same account, which\n    could otherwise cause
  confusing balance assertion failures (#912).\n    (Because assignments now generate
  amounts to satisfy balance assertions\n    before transaction modifier rules are
  applied (#908).)\n\n-   journal format: periodic transaction rules are now aware
  of Y default year directives. (#892)\n    Ie when a default year Y is in effect,
  they resolve partial or relative\n    dates using Y/1/1 as the reference date, rather
  than today's date.\n\n# 1.11.1 (2018/10/06)\n\n-   fix wrong transaction rendering
  in balance assertion errors and when\n    using the add command\n\n# 1.11 (2018/9/30)\n\n-
  \  The default display order of accounts is now influenced by\n    the order of
  account directives. Accounts declared by account\n    directives are displayed first
  (top-most), in declaration order,\n    followed by undeclared accounts in alphabetical
  order. Numeric\n    account codes are no longer used, and are ignored and considered\n
  \   deprecated.\n\n    So if your accounts are displaying in a weird order after
  upgrading,\n    and you want them alphabetical like before, just sort your account\n
  \   directives alphabetically.\n\n-   Account sorting (by name, by declaration,
  by amount) is now more\n    robust and supported consistently by all commands (accounts,\n
  \   balance, bs..) in all modes (tree & flat, tabular & non-tabular).\n\n-   close:
  new --opening/--closing flags to print only the opening or\n    closing transaction\n\n-
  \  files: a new command to list included files\n\n-   prices: query arguments are
  now supported. Prices can be filtered by\n    date, and postings providing transaction
  prices can also be filtered.\n\n-   rewrite: help clarifies relation to print --auto
  (#745)\n\n-   roi: a new command to compute return on investment, based on hledger-irr\n\n-
  \  test: has more verbose output, more informative failure messages,\n    and no
  longer tries to read the journal\n\n-   csv: We use a more robust CSV lib (cassava)
  and now support\n    non-comma separators, eg --separator ';' (experimental, this
  flag\n    will probably become a CSV rule) (#829)\n\n-   csv: interpolated field
  names in values are now properly case insensitive, so\n    this works:\n\n        fields
  \ ...,Transaction_Date,...\n        date %Transaction_Date\n\n-   journal: D (default
  commodity) directives no longer break multiplier\n    amounts in transaction modifiers
  (AKA automated postings) (#860)\n\n-   journal: \"Automated Postings\" have been
  renamed to \"Transaction Modifiers\".\n\n-   journal: transaction comments in transaction
  modifier rules are now parsed correctly. (#745)\n\n-   journal: when include files
  form a cycle, we give an error instead\n    of hanging.\n\n-   upper-case day/month
  names in period expressions no longer give an error (#847, #852)\n\n# 1.10 (2018/6/30)\n\n-
  \  journal: many parse error messages have become more informative, and\n    some
  now show the source line and error location.\n\n-   journal: ;tag: is no longer
  parsed as a tag named \";tag\" (#655)\n\n-   journal: transaction price amounts
  having their own price amounts is\n    now a parse error\n\n-   journal: amounts
  with space as digit group separator and trailing whitespace\n    now parse correctly
  (#780)\n\n-   journal: in amounts containing digits and a single space, the space\n
  \   is now interpreted as a digit group separator, not a decimal separator (#749)\n\n-
  \  journal: in commodity/format/D directives, the amount must now include a decimal
  separator.\n\n    When more precise control is needed over number parsing, our\n
  \   recommended solution is commodity directives. Commodity directives\n    that
  don't specify the decimal separator leave things ambiguous,\n    increasing the
  chance of misparsing numbers. In some cases it could\n    cause amounts with a decimal
  point to be parsed as if with a digit\n    group separator, so 1.234 became 1234.\n\n
  \   It seems the simple and really only way to do this reliably is to require\n
  \   an explicit decimal point character. Most folks probably do this already.\n
  \   Unfortunately, it makes another potential incompatibility with ledger and\n
  \   beancount journals. But the error message will be clear and easy to\n    work
  around.\n\n-   journal: directives currently have diverse and somewhat tricky\n
  \   semantics, especially with multiple files. The manual now describes\n    their
  behaviour precisely.\n\n-   journal: `alias` and `apply account` directives now
  affect `account` directives (#825)\n\n-   journal: periodic transactions can now
  have all the usual transaction fields\n    (status mark, code, description, comment),
  for generating more expressive\n    forecast transactions.\n\n-   journal: forecast
  transactions now have the generating period\n    expression attached as a tag named
  \"recur\".\n\n-   journal: periodic transactions now start on the first instance
  of the\n    recurring date, rather than the day after the last regular transaction
  (#750)\n\n-   journal: periodic transaction rules now allow period expressions relative
  to today's date\n\n-   csv: amount-in/amount-out errors are more detailed\n\n-   balance:
  --drop is now ignored when not in flat mode,\n    rather than producing a corrupted
  report (#754)\n\n-   budget: --drop now preserves the <unbudgeted> top-level account
  in --budget reports\n\n-   register: in CSV output, the code field is now included
  (#746)\n\n-   smart dates now allow the YYYYMM format, and are better documented\n\n-
  \  use hledger-lib 1.10\n\n# 1.9.1 (2018/4/30)\n\n-   use hledger-lib 1.9.1\n\n-
  \  budget (balance --budget): monthly columns are displayed in the\n    proper order.
  This fixes a regression in 1.9.\n\n-   budget: budgets can be built from periodic
  transactions with\n    different intervals again. In 1.9, budgets were restricted
  to a\n    single interval, but this was a mistake. This restores the 1.5\n    behaviour.\n\n-
  \  budget: budget reports are more intuitive and much less likely to\n    produce
  no output.\n\n-   budget: when no report interval is specified, a budget report
  for\n    the whole journal period is shown.\n\n-   budget: periodic transactions
  and the requested report period can\n    each have their own start/end dates, and
  the resulting report will\n    span the union of those periods, showing zeroes where
  data is\n    missing.\n\n-   budget: total row and total/average columns are now
  calculated correctly\n\n-   budget: actual, percentage, and goal amounts are now
  aligned in\n    columns for better readability (usually, unless numbers get huge).\n\n-
  \  budget: combining --budget and --sort-amount is not yet supported\n    and now
  gives an error.\n\n-   csv: handle \"-%amount\" in a rule when the CSV amount is
  parenthesised (#736)\n\n-   journal: automated postings are now generated early,
  before journal finalisation,\n    so they are present for amount inference, transaction
  balancing, and balance assertions\n    (#729)\n\n-   journal: automated postings
  are now inserted right after the posting that triggered them\n    (#729)\n\n-   cli:
  command-line account aliases are now applied early, before journal finalisation,\n
  \   so they are equivalent to alias directives in the journal (#730)\n\n-   journal:
  inferred amounts now have the appropriate standard amount style applied\n    (setting
  the precision correctly, eg). (#737)\n\n-   journal: when checking for balanced
  transactions, amount styles declared with\n    commodity directives are also used
  (previously only inferred amount styles were).\n\n# 1.9 (2018/3/31)\n\n-   support
  ghc 8.4, latest deps\n\n-   journal: account directives can define a numeric account
  code to\n    customize sorting. bal/bs/cf/is will sort accounts by account code,\n
  \   if any, then account name.\n\n-   journal: support scientific number notation
  (#704, #706)\n\n-   csv: reading a CSV file containing no records is no longer an
  error\n\n-   cli: when the system text encoding is UTF-8, ignore any UTF-8 BOM\n
  \   prefix found when reading files. (Paypal's new CSV has this BOM\n    prefix,
  causing a confusing parse error.)\n\n-   cli: tabular reports no longer have a trailing
  blank line added.\n    (This allows omitting the \">=0\" delimiters in our functional
  tests,\n    making them easier to read and maintain.)\n\n-   acc: the accounts command
  now has --declared and --used flags\n\n-   bal: the --invert flag flips all signs\n\n-
  \  bal: --drop now works with CSV output\n\n-   bal/bs/bse/cf/is: show overall report
  span in title\n\n-   bal/bs/bse/cf/is: show short month names as headings in monthly
  reports\n\n-   bal/bs/bse/cf/is: these commands can now generate HTML output\n\n-
  \  bal/bs/is/cf: drop short name and indent fields from multicolumn CSV\n\n-   bs/bse/cf/is:
  these, the \"financial statement\" commands, now show\n    normal income, liability
  and equity balances as positive numbers.\n    Negative numbers now indicate a contra-balance
  (eg an overdrawn\n    checking account), a net loss, or a negative net worth. This
  makes\n    these reports more like conventional financial statements, and easier\n
  \   to read and share with others. (Other commands, like balance, have not\n    changed.)
  (experimental)\n\n-   bs/cf/is: always show a tabular report, even with no report\n
  \   interval. Previously you would get a simple borderless report like\n    the
  original balance command. Less code, fewer bugs.\n\n-   bs/bse/cf/is: in CSV output,
  don't repeat the headings row for each subreport\n\n-   budget: warn that CSV output
  with bal --budget is unimplemented\n\n-   budget: bal --budget shows budget goals
  even with no or zero actual amounts.\n    Makes budget reports more intuitive, at
  the cost of a temporary hack\n    which may misorder columns in some cases (if actual
  and budget\n    activity occur in a different range of columns).\n\n-   budget:
  --budget uses only periodic txns with the selected interval.\\\n    Budgets with
  different interval, eg a daily and weekly budget, are independent.\n\n-   budget:
  show mostly fixed-width columns for readability\n\n-   budget: fix bug where a budget
  report could include budget goals\n    ending on the day before the report start
  date (splitSpan issue)\n\n-   close: the equity command has been renamed to close.
  It now ignores\n    any begin date (it always closes historical end balances). It
  also\n    ignores --date2.\n\n# 1.5 (2017/12/31)\n\n-   --auto adds Ledger-style
  automated postings to transactions (Dmitry Astapov, Mykola Orliuk)\n\n-   --forecast
  generates Ledger-style periodic transactions in the future (Dmitry Astapov, Mykola
  Orliuk)\n\n-   -V/--value uses today's market prices by default, not those of last
  transaction date. #683, #648\n\n-   add: suggest implied (parent) and declared (by
  account directives) account names also\n\n-   bal: --budget shows performance compared
  to budget goals defined\n    with periodic transactions. Accounts with budget goals
  are\n    displayed folded (depth-clipped) at a depth matching the budget\n    specification.
  Unbudgeted accounts are hidden, or with\n    --show-unbudgeted, shown at their usual
  depth. (Dmitry Astapov)\n\n-   import: the output of --dry-run is now valid journal
  format\n\n-   print: -B shows converted amounts again, as in 1.1, even without\n
  \   -x. #551 (Mykola Orliuk, Simon Michael)\n\n-   tag: the first argument now filters
  tag names, additional arguments\n    filter transactions (#261)\n\n-   remove upper
  bounds on all but hledger* and base (experimental)\n\n# 1.4 (2017/9/30)\n\n-   cli:
  a @FILE argument reads flags & args from FILE, one per line\n\n-   cli: reorganized
  commands list, added some new command aliases:\n\n    -   accounts: a\n    -   balance:
  b\n    -   print: p, txns\n    -   register: r\n\n-   cli: accept -NUM as a shortcut
  for --depth=NUM (eg: -2)\n\n-   cli: improve command-line help for --date2 (#604)\n\n-
  \  cli: make --help and -h the same, drop --man and --info for now (#579)\n\n-   help:
  offers multiple formats, accepts topic substrings.\n    The separate info/man commands
  have been dropped. help now\n    chooses an appropriate documentation format as
  follows:\n\n    -   it uses info if available,\n    -   otherwise man if available,\n
  \   -   otherwise $PAGER if defined,\n    -   otherwise less if available,\n    -
  \  otherwise it prints on stdout\n    -   (and it always prints on stdout when piped).\n\n
  \   You can override this with the `--info`/`--man`/`--pager`/`--cat` flags.\n    (#579)\n\n-
  \  bal/bs/cf/is: --sort-amount/-S sorts by largest amount instead of\n    account
  name\n\n-   bs/cf/is: support --output-file and --output-format=txt\\|csv\n    The
  CSV output should be reasonably ok for dragging into a\n    spreadsheet and reformatting.\n\n-
  \  bal/bs/cf/is: consistent double space between columns, consistent\n    single
  final blank line. Previously, amounts wider than the column\n    headings would
  be separated by only a single space.\n\n-   bs/is: don't let an empty subreport
  disable the grand totals (fixes #588)\n\n-   cf: exclude asset accounts with \":fixed\"
  in their name (Christian G. Warden, Simon Michael, #584)\n\n-   new balancesheetequity
  command: like balancesheet but also shows\n    equity accounts (Nicholas Niro)\n\n-
  \  new import command: adds new transactions seen in one or more input\n    files
  to the main journal file\n\n-   print: --new shows only transactions added since
  last time\n    (saves state in .latest.JOURNALFILE file)\n\n-   new tags command:
  lists tags in matched transactions\n\n-   most addons formerly shipped in bin/ are
  now builtin commands. These\n    include: check-dates, check-dupes, equity, prices,
  print-unique,\n    register-match, rewrite.\n\n-   refactor: new Commands module
  and subdirectory.\n    Builtin commands are now gathered more tightly in a single
  module,\n    Hledger.Cli.Commands, facilitating change. The legacy \"convert\"\n
  \   command has been dropped.\n\n-   refactor: BalanceView -> CompoundBalanceCommand\n\n-
  \  deps: drop support for directory < 1.2\n\n-   deps: allow ansi-terminal 0.7\n\n-
  \  deps: drop oldtime flag, require time 1.5+\n\n-   deps: simplify shakespeare
  bounds\n\n-   deps: remove ghc < 7.6 support\n\n# 1.3.1 (2017/8/25)\n\n-   bs/is:
  don't let an empty subreport disable the grand totals (#588)\n\n-   allow megaparsec
  6 (#594)\n\n-   allow megaparsec-6.1 (Hans-Peter Deifel)\n\n-   restore upper bounds
  on hledger packages\n\n# 1.3 (2017/6/30)\n\nThe \"uncleared\" transaction/posting
  status, and associated UI flags\nand keys, have been renamed to \"unmarked\" to
  remove ambiguity and\nconfusion. This means that we have dropped the `--uncleared`
  flag,\nand our `-U` flag now matches only unmarked things and not pending\nones.
  See the issue and linked mail list discussion for more\nbackground. (#564)\n\nAlso
  the -P short flag has been added for --pending, and the -U/-P/-C\nflags can be combined.\n\nbs/is:
  fix \"Ratio has zero denominator\" error (#535)\n\nbs/is/cf: fix --flat (#552) (Justin
  Le, Simon Michael)\n\nbal/bs/is/cf: show negative amounts in red (Simon Michael,
  Justin Le).\nThese commands now shows negative amounts in red, when hledger detects\nthat
  ANSI codes are supported, (ie when TERM is not \"dumb\" and stdout\nis not being
  redirected or piped).\n\nprint: show pending mark on postings (fixes #563).\nA pending
  mark on postings is now displayed, just like a cleared mark.\nAlso there will now
  be a space between the mark and account name.\n\nprint: amounts are now better aligned,
  eg when there are posting\nstatus marks or virtual postings\n\n# 1.2 (2017/3/31)\n\n##
  CLI\n\n\"hledger\" and \"hledger -h\" now print a better organised commands list\nand
  general usage message respectively (#297).\n\nThe common reporting flags can now
  be used anywhere on the command line.\n\nFixed deduplication of addons in commands
  list.\n\nFixed ugly stack traces in command line parse error messages.\n\nThe -V/--value
  flag is now a global report flag, so it works with\nbalance, print, register, balancesheet,
  incomestatement, cashflow,\netc. (Justin Le)\n\nThe `--pivot` global reporting option
  replaces all account names with\nthe value of some other field or tag. It has been
  improved, eg:\n\n-   we don't add the field/tag name name as a prefix\n-   when
  pivoting on a tag, if the tag is missing we show a blank\n    (rather than showing
  mixed tag values and account names)\n-   a pipe character delimiter may be used
  in descriptions to get a more accurate\n    and useful payee report (`hledger balance
  --pivot payee`)\n\noptions cleanups\n\n## Addons\n\nEasier installation:\nmove add-ons
  and example scripts to bin/,\nconvert to stack scripts,\nadd a build script to install
  all deps,\nadd some functional tests,\ntest add-ons with Travis CI,\nadd installation
  docs to download page.\n\nImproved docs:\nall addons now contain their own documentation.
  Most of them (all but\nhledger-budget) use a new reduced-boilerplate declaration
  format\nand can show short (-h) and long (--help) command line help.\n(Long help
  is declared with pre and postambles to the generated\noptions help, short help is
  that truncated at the start of the hledger\ncommon flags.)\n\n`hledger` now shows
  a cleaner list of addon commands, showing only the\ncompiled version of an addon
  when both source and compiled versions\nare in $PATH. (Addons with .exe extension
  or no extension are\nconsidered compiled. Modification time is not checked, ie,
  an old\ncompiled addon will override a newer source version. If there are\nthree
  or more versions of an addon, all are shown. )\n\nNew addons added/included:\n\n-
  \  autosync - example symlink to ledger-autosync\n-   budget - experimental budget
  reporting command supporting Ledger-like periodic transactions and automated transactions
  (Mykola Orliuk)\n-   chart - pie-chart-generating prototype, a repackaging of the
  old hledger-chart tool\n-   check - more powerful balance assertions (Michael Walker)\n-
  \  check-dupes - find accounts sharing the same leaf name (Stefano Rodighiero)\n-
  \  prices - show all market price records (Mykola Orliuk)\n-   register-match -
  a helper for ledger-autosync's deduplication, finds best match for a transaction
  description\n\nThe equity command now always generates a valid journal transaction,\nhandles
  prices better, and adds balance assertions (Mykola Orliuk).\n\nThe rewrite command
  is more robust and powerful (Mykola Orliuk):\n\n-   in addition to command-line
  rewrite options, it understands rewrite rules\n    defined in the journal, similar
  to Ledger's automated transactions (#99).\n    Eg:\n\n        = ^income\n            (liabilities:tax)
  \ *.33\n\n        = expenses:gifts\n            budget:gifts  *-1\n            assets:budget
  \ *1\n\n-   it can generate diff output, allowing easier review of the proposed\n
  \   changes, and safe modification of original journal files (preserving\n    file-level
  comments and directives). Eg:\n\n        hledger-rewrite --diff Agency --add-posting
  'Expenses:Taxes  *0.17' | patch\n\n-   rewrites can affect multiple postings in
  a transaction, not just one.\n\n-   posting-specific dates are handled better\n\n##
  balance\n\nA new --pretty-tables option uses unicode characters for rendering\ntable
  borders in multicolumn reports (#522) (Moritz Kiefer)\n\n## balancesheet/cashflow/incomestatement\n\nThese
  commands are now more powerful, able to show multicolumn reports\nand generally
  having the same features as the balance command. (Justin Le)\n\nbalancesheet has
  always ignored a begin date specified with a `-b` or\n`-p` option; now it also ignores
  a begin date specified with a `date:`\nquery. (Related discussion at #531)\n\n##
  print\n\nThe output of print is now always a valid journal (fixes #465) (Mykola
  Orliuk).\n\nprint now tries to preserves the format of implicit/explicit balancing\namounts
  and prices, by default. To print with all amounts explicit,\nuse the new `--explicit/-x`
  flag (fixes #442). (Mykola Orliuk)\n\nDon't lose the commodity of zero amounts/zero
  balance assertions (fixes #475) (Mykola Orliuk)\n\n## Misc\n\nFix a regression in
  the readability of option parsing errors (#478) (Hans-Peter Deifel)\n\nFix an example
  in Cli/Main.hs (Steven R. Baker)\n\nAllow megaparsec 5.2 (#503)\n\n# 1.1 (2016/12/31)\n\n##
  balance\n\n-   with -V, don't ignore market prices in the future (#453, #403)\n\n-
  \  with -V and multiple same-date market prices, use the last parsed not the highest
  price (#403)\n\n## misc\n\n-   fix non-existent \"oldtime\" dependency (#431)\n\n-
  \  extra/hledger-equity.hs now generates valid journal format when there are multiple
  commodities\n\n# 1.0.1 (2016/10/27)\n\n-   allow megaparsec 5.0 or 5.1\n\n-   fix
  benchmark build failure (#423)\n\n# 1.0 (2016/10/26)\n\n## add\n\n-   suggest only
  one commodity at a time as default amount (#383)\n\n    (since we currently can't
  input more than one at a time)\n\n## balance\n\n-   added --change flag for consistency\n\n-
  \  -H/--historical now also affects single-column balance reports with a start date
  (#392).\n\n    This has the same effect as just omitting the start date, but adds
  consistency.\n\n-   in CSV output, render amounts in one-line format (#336)\n\n##

  tool, for now.)\n\n-   try to clarify balance/register's various report modes,\n\n
  \   kinds of \"balance\" displayed, and related options and language.\n\n-   with
  multiple --change/--cumulative/--historical flags, use the last one instead of complaining\n\n-
  \  don't add the \"d\" suffix when displaying day periods\n\n-   stack-ify extra/hledger-rewrite.hs\n\n##
  misc\n\n-   added GHC 8 support, dropped GHC 7.6 and 7.8 support.\n\n    GHC 7.8
  support could be restored with small code changes and a maintainer.\n\n-   a cabal.project
  file has been added (Moritz Kiefer)\n\n-   use hpack for maintaining cabal files
  (#371).\n\n    Instead of editing cabal files directly, we now edit the less\n    verbose
  and less redundant package.yaml files and let stack (or\n    hpack) update the cabal
  files. We commit both the .yaml and\n    .cabal files.\n\n-   clean up some old
  cabal flags\n\n-   tools/simplebench has been spun off as the quickbench package.\n\n-
  \  add Appveyor CI builds, provide up-to-date binaries for Windows\n\n-   extra:
  add a bunch of CSV rules examples\n\n## docs\n\n-   the website is simpler, clearer,
  and more mobile-friendly.\n\n    Docs are now collected on a single page and organised
  by type: getting started, reference, more.\n\n-   reference docs have been split
  into one manual for each executable and file format.\n\n    This helps with maintenance
  and packaging and also should make it\n    easier to see what's available and to
  read just what you need.\n\n-   manuals are now provided in html, plain text, man
  and info formats\n\n    generated from the same source by a new Shake-based docs
  build system. (#292)\n\n-   versioned manuals are provided on the website, covering
  recent releases and the latest dev version (#385, #387)\n\n-   manuals are built
  in to the hledger executables, allowing easy offline reading on all platforms.\n\n
  \       PROG -h              shows PROG's command-line usage\n        PROG --help
  \         shows PROG's manual (fixed width)\n        PROG --man           shows
  PROG's manual with man (formatted/paged)\n        PROG --info          shows PROG's
  manual with info (hypertext)\n        hledger help [TOPIC] shows any manual\n        hledger
  man  [TOPIC] shows any manual with man\n        hledger info [TOPIC] shows any manual
  with info\n\n-   the general and reporting options are now listed in all executable
  manuals.\n\n    We assume any of them which are unsupported are harmlessly ignored.\n\n-
  \  demo.hledger.org is using beancount's example journal.\n\n    This is the somewhat
  realistic example journal from the beancount\n    project, tweaked for hledger.\n\n-
  \  minor copyedits (jungle-boogie)\n\n## cli\n\n-   parsing multiple input files
  is now robust.\n\n    When multiple -f options are provided, we now parse each file\n
  \   individually rather than just concatenating them, so they can\n    have different
  formats (#320). Note this also means that\n    directives (like \\`Y\\` or \\`alias\\`)
  no longer carry over from one\n    file to the next.\n\n-   -I has been added as
  the short flag for --ignore-assertions\n\n    (this is different from Ledger's CLI,
  but useful for hledger-ui).\n\n-   parsing an argument-less --debug option is more
  robust\n\n0.27 (2015/10/30)\n\nAccount aliases:\n\n-   Regular expression account
  aliases are now fast enough that you can\n    use lots of them without slowing things
  down. They now take\n    O(aliases x accounts) time, instead of O(aliases x transactions);\n
  \   also, regular expressions are no longer recompiled unnecessarily.\n\nDocumentation:\n\n-
  \  Each hledger package now includes one or more man pages, generated\n    from
  markdown by the mighty pandoc. Currently there are six: one\n    for each main executable
  and each input file format. Currently these\n    somewhat duplicate the manual on
  the website; this will be resolved\n    somehow. (#282).\n\n-   The site is now
  built with hakyll-std, a generic hakyll script.\n\n-   hledger once again has a
  HCAR entry.\n\nTools:\n\n-   The hledger cabal files are now generated from package.yaml
  files by\n    hpack, in principle, removing a lot of error-prone duplication and\n
  \   boilerplate. (In practice, both files are being updated manually\n    for the
  moment, until hpack supports flags and conditional blocks.)\n\n-   Time/allocation
  and heap profiling is working again, and easier:\n\n    -   `make quickprof-CMD`
  generates a profile for CMD, which runs\n        against one of the sample journals.
  (CMD must be one word,\n        enclosing in double quotes isn't working here for
  some reason).\n\n    -   `make quickheap-CMD` generates a heap profile for CMD,
  in\n        hledgerprof.ps, and tries to open it in a viewer (currently the\n        mac-friendly
  \"open\" executable, so you may need to adjust this in\n        the makefile). As
  with quickprof, CMD must be one word and runs\n        against one of the sample
  journals.\n\n    -   `make hledgerprof` builds the hledgerprof executable used for\n
  \       time/allocation profiling. `make hledgercov` builds the hledgercov\n        executable
  used for coverage reports.\n\n-   Travis CI now tests the build on each github push
  and announces\n    status changes by email and on #hledger.\n\nJournal format:\n\n-
  \  Dates must now begin with a digit (not /, eg).\n\n-   The comment directive longer
  requires an end comment, and will\n    extend to the end of the file(s) without
  it.\n\nCommand-line interface:\n\n-   Output (balance reports, register reports,
  print output etc.)\n    containing wide characters, eg chinese/japanese/korean characters,\n
  \   should now align correctly, when viewed in apps and fonts that show\n    wide
  characters as double width (#242).\n\n-   The argument for --depth or depth: must
  now be positive.\n\nadd:\n\n-   Journal entries are now written with all amounts
  explicit, to avoid\n    losing price info (#283).\n\n-   Fixed a bug which sometimes
  (when the same letter pair was repeated)\n    caused it not to pick the most similar
  past transaction for defaults.\n\nbalance:\n\n-   There is now a -V/--value flag
  to report current market value (as in Ledger).\n    It converts all reported amounts
  using their \"default market price\".\n    \"Market price\" is the new name for
  \"historical prices\", defined with the P directive.\n    The default market price
  for a commodity is the most recent one found in the journal on or before the report
  end date.\n\n    Unlike Ledger, hledger's -V uses only the market prices recorded\n
  \   with P directives; it does not use the \"transaction prices\"\n    recorded
  as part of posting amounts (which are used by -B/--cost).\n    Also, using both
  -B and -V at the same time is supported.\n\n-   Fixed a bug in amount normalization
  which caused amount styles\n    (commodity symbol placement, decimal point character,
  etc.) to be\n    lost in certain cases (#230, #276).\n\n-   The balance command's
  --format option can now adjust the rendering\n    style of multi-commodity amounts,
  if you begin the format string\n    with one of:\n\n        %_  - renders amounts
  on multiple lines, bottom-aligned (the default)\n        %^  - renders amounts on
  multiple lines, top-aligned\n        %,  - renders amounts on one line, comma-separated\n\n-
  \  The balance report's final total (and the line above it) now adapt\n    themselves
  to a custom --format.\n\nprint:\n\n-   The --match option prints the journal entry
  that best matches a\n    description (ie whose description field is most similar
  to the value\n    given, and if there are several equally similar, the most recent).\n
  \   This was originally an add-on I used to guess account names for\n    ledger-autosync.
  It's nice for quickly looking up a recent\n    transaction from a guessed or partial
  description.\n\n-   print now always right-aligns the amounts in an entry, even
  when\n    they are wider than 12 characters. (If there is a price, it's\n    considered
  part of the amount for right-alignment.)\n\nregister:\n\n-   Amount columns now
  resize automatically, using more space if it's\n    needed and available.\n\n0.26
  (2015/7/12)\n\nAccount aliases:\n\n-   Account aliases are once again non-regular-expression-based,
  by default. (#252)\n\n    The regex account aliases added in 0.24 trip up people
  switching between\n    hledger and Ledger. (Also they are currently slow).\n\n    This
  change makes the old non-regex aliases the default; they are\n    unsurprising,
  useful, and pretty close in functionality to Ledger's.\n\n    The new regex aliases
  are still available; they must be enclosed\n    in forward slashes. (Ledger effectively
  ignores these.)\n\nJournal format:\n\n-   We now parse, and also print, journal
  entries with no postings, as\n    proposed on the mail lists. These are not well-formed
  General\n    Journal entries/transactions, but here is my rationale:\n\n    -   Ledger
  and beancount parse them\n    -   if they are parsed, they should be printed\n    -
  \  they provide a convenient way to record (and report) non-transaction events\n
  \   -   they permit more gradual introduction and learning of the concepts.\n        So
  eg a beginner can keep a simple journal before learning about accounts and postings.\n\n-
  \  Trailing whitespace after a `comment` directive is now ignored.\n\nCommand-line
  interface:\n\n-   The -f/file option may now be used multiple times.\n    This is
  equivalent to concatenating the input files before running hledger.\n    The add
  command adds entries to the first file specified.\n\nQueries:\n\n-   real: (no argument)
  is now a synonym for real:1\n\n-   tag: now matches tag names with a regular expression,
  like most other queries\n\n-   empty: is no longer supported, as it overlaps a bit
  confusingly with\n    amt:0. The --empty flag is still available.\n\n-   You can
  now match on pending status (#250)\n\n    A transaction/posting status of ! (pending)
  was effectively equivalent\n    to * (cleared). Now it's a separate state, not matched
  by --cleared.\n    The new Ledger-compatible --pending flag matches it, and so does\n
  \   --uncleared.\n\n    The relevant search query terms are now status:*, status:!
  and\n    status: (the old status:1 and status:0 spellings are deprecated).\n\n    Since
  we interpret --uncleared and status: as \"any state except cleared\",\n    it's
  not currently possible to match things which are neither cleared\n    nor pending.\n\nactivity:\n\n-
  \  activity no longer excludes 0-amount postings by default.\n\nadd:\n\n-   Don't
  show quotes around the journal file path in the \"Creating...\"\n    message, for
  consistency with the subsequent \"Adding...\" message.\n\nbalancesheet:\n\n-   Accounts
  beginning with \"debt\" or now also recognised as liabilities.\n\nprint:\n\n-   We
  now limit the display precision of inferred prices. (#262)\n\n    When a transaction
  posts to two commodities without specifying the\n    conversion price, we generate
  a price which makes it balance (cf\n    https://hledger.org/hledger.html#prices).
  The print command showed\n    this with full precision (so that manual calculations
  with the\n    displayed numbers would look right), but this sometimes meant we\n
  \   showed 255 digits (when there are multiple postings in the\n    commodity being
  priced, and the averaged unit price is an\n    irrational number). In this case
  we now set the price's display\n    precision to the sum of the (max) display precisions
  of the\n    commodities involved. An example:\n\n          hledgerdev -f- print\n
  \         <<<\n          1/1\n              c    C 10.00\n              c    C 11.00\n
  \             d  D -320.00\n          >>>\n          2015/01/01\n              c
  \ C 10.00 @ D 15.2381\n              c  C 11.00 @ D 15.2381\n              d     D
  -320.00\n\n          >>>=0\n\n    There might still be cases where this will show
  more price decimal\n    places than necessary.\n\n-   We now show inferred unit
  prices with at least 2 decimal places.\n\n    When inferring prices, if the commodities
  involved have low\n    display precisions, we don't do a good job of rendering\n
  \   accurate-looking unit prices. Eg if the journal doesn't use any\n    decimal
  places, any inferred unit prices are also displayed with\n    no decimal places,
  which makes them look wrong to the user. Now,\n    we always give inferred unit
  prices a minimum display precision of\n    2, which helps a bit.\n\nregister:\n\n-
  \  Postings with no amounts could give a runtime error in some obscure case, now
  fixed.\n\nstats:\n\n-   stats now supports -o/--outputfile, like register/balance/print.\n-
  \  An O(n\\^2) performance slowdown has been fixed, it's now much faster on large
  journals.\n\n        +--------------------------------------++--------+--------+\n

  \  The June 30 day span was not being rendered correctly; fixed. (#272)\n\n-   The
  bench script invoked by \"cabal bench\" or \"stack bench\" now runs\n    some simple
  benchmarks.\n\n    You can get more accurate benchmark times by running with --criterion.\n
  \   This will usually give much the same numbers and takes much longer.\n\n    Or
  with --simplebench, it benchmarks whatever commands are\n    configured in bench/default.bench.
  This mode uses the first\n    \"hledger\" executable in $PATH.\n\n-   The deprecated
  shakespeare-text dependency has been removed more thoroughly.\n\n0.25.1 (2015/4/29)\n\n-
  \  timelog: support the description field (#247)\n\n0.25 (2015/4/7)\n\n-   GHC 7.10
  compatibility (#239)\n\n-   build with terminfo support on POSIX systems by default\n\n
  \   On non-windows systems, we now build with terminfo support by\n    default,
  useful for detecting terminal width and other things.\n\n    This requires the C
  curses dev libraries, which makes POSIX\n    installation slightly harder; if it
  causes problems you can\n    disable terminfo support with the new `curses` cabal
  flag, eg:\n    cabal install -f-curses ... (or cabal might try this\n    automatically,
  I'm not sure).\n\n-   register: use the full terminal width, respect COLUMNS, allow
  column width adjustment\n\n    On POSIX systems, register now uses the full terminal
  width by\n    default. Specifically, the output width is set from:\n\n    1.  a
  --width option\n    2.  or a COLUMNS environment variable (NB: not the same as a
  bash shell var)\n    3.  or on POSIX (non-windows) systems, the current terminal
  width\n    4.  or the default, 80 characters.\n\n    Also, register's --width option
  now accepts an optional\n    description column width following the overall width
  (--width\n    WIDTH\\[,DESCWIDTH\\]). This also sets the account column width, since\n
  \   the available space (WIDTH-41) is divided up between these two\n    columns.
  Here's a diagram:\n\n          <--------------------------------- width (W) ---------------------------------->\n
  \         date (10)  description (D)       account (W-41-D)     amount (12)   balance
  (12)\n          DDDDDDDDDD dddddddddddddddddddd  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  AAAAAAAAAAAA
  \ AAAAAAAAAAAA\n\n    Examples:\n\n          $ hledger reg                 # use
  terminal width on posix\n          $ hledger reg -w 100          # width 100, equal
  description/account widths\n          $ hledger reg -w 100,40       # width 100,
  wider description\n          $ hledger reg -w $COLUMNS,100 # terminal width and
  set description width\n\n-   balance: new -T/--row-total and -A/--average options\n\n
  \   In multicolumn balance reports, -T/--row-total now shows a row totals\n    column
  and -A/--average shows a row averages column.\n    This helps eg to see monthly
  average expenses (hledger bal \\^expenses -MA).\n\n    NB our use of -T deviates
  from Ledger's UI, where -T sets a custom\n    final total expression.\n\n-   balance:
  -N is now short for --no-total\n-   balance: fix partially-visible totals row with
  --no-total\n\n    A periodic (not using --cumulative or --historical) balance report\n
  \   with --no-total now hides the totals row properly.\n\n-   journal, csv: comment
  lines can also start with *\n\n    As in Ledger. This means you can embed emacs
  org/outline-mode nodes in\n    your journal file and manipulate it like an outline.\n\n0.24.1
  (2015/3/15)\n\n-   journal: fix balance accumulation across assertions (#195)\n\n
  \   A sequence of balance assertions asserting first one commodity, then\n    another,
  then the first again, was not working.\n\n-   timelog: show hours with two decimal
  places instead of one (#237)\n-   in weekly reports, simplify week 52's heading
  like the others\n-   disallow trailing garbage in a number of parsers\n\n    Trailing
  garbage is no longer ignored when parsing the following:\n    balance --format option,
  register --width option, hledger-rewrite\n    options, hledger add's inputs, CSV
  amounts, posting amounts,\n    posting dates in tags.\n\n-   allow utf8-string-1
  (fpco/stackage/#426)\n\n0.24 (2014/12/25)\n\nGeneral:\n\n-   fix redundant compilation
  when cabal installing the hledger packages\n-   switch to Decimal for representing
  amounts (#118)\n-   report interval headings (eg in balance, register reports) are
  shown\n    compactly when possible\n-   general speedups\n\nJournal format:\n\n-
  \  detect decimal point and digit groups more robustly (#196)\n-   check that transaction
  dates are followed by whitespace or newline\n-   check that dates use a consistent
  separator character\n-   balance assertions now are specific to a single commodity,
  like\n    Ledger (#195)\n-   support multi-line comments using \"comment\", \"end
  comment\"\n    directives, like Ledger\n\nCSV format:\n\n-   reading CSV data from
  stdin now works better\n-   the rules file include directive is now relative to
  the current\n    file's directory (#198)\n-   the original order of same-day transactions
  is now usually preserved\n    (if the records appear to be in reverse date order,
  we reverse them\n    before finally sorting by transaction date)\n-   CSV output
  is now built in to the balance, print, and register\n    commands, controlled by
  -O/--output-format (and -o/--output-file,\n    see below)\n\nCLI:\n\n-   the --width
  and --debug options now require their argument (#149)\n-   when an option is repeated,
  the last value takes precedence (#219).\n    This is helpful eg for customising
  your reporting command aliases on\n    the fly.\n-   smart dates (used in -p/-b/-e/date:/date2:)
  now must use a\n    consistent separator character, and must be parseable to the
  end\n-   output destination and format selection is now built in to the\n    balance,
  print and register commands, controlled by -o/--output-file\n    and -O/--output-format
  options. Notes:\n    -   -o - means stdout\n    -   an output file name suffix matching
  a supported format will also\n        set the output format, unless overridden by
  --output-format\n    -   commands' supported output formats are listed in their\n
  \       command-line help. Two formats are currently available:\n        txt (the
  default) and csv.\n-   balance assertions can be disabled with --ignore-assertions\n\nAccount
  aliases:\n\n-   all matching account aliases are now applied, not just one directive\n
  \   and one option\n-   account aliases now match by case insensitive regular expressions\n
  \   matching anywhere in the account name\n-   account aliases can replace multiple
  occurrences of the pattern\n    within an account name\n-   an account alias replacement
  pattern can reference matched groups\n    with \\N\n\nQueries:\n\n-   date:/date2:
  with a malformed date now reports an error instead of\n    being ignored\n-   amt:
  now supports >= or <=\n-   clarify status: docs and behaviour; \\\"*\\\" is no longer
  a synonym for\n    \"1\" (fixes #227)\n\nbalance:\n\n-   fix: in tree mode, --drop
  is ignored instead of showing empty account names\n-   a depth limit of 0 now shows
  summary items with account name \"...\",\n    instead of an empty report (#206)\n-
  \  in multicolumn balance reports, -E now also shows posting-less\n    accounts
  with a non-zero balance during the period (in addition to\n    showing leading &
  trailing empty columns)\n-   in multicolumn reports, multi-commodity amounts are
  rendered on one\n    line for better layout (#186)\n-   multicolumn reports' title
  now includes the report span\n\nregister:\n\n-   runs faster with large output\n-
  \  supports date2:, and date:/date2: combined with --date2, better (fixes\n    #201,
  #221, #222)\n-   a depth limit of 0 now shows summary items (see balance)\n-   -A/--average
  now implies -E/--empty\n-   postings with multi-commodity amounts are now top-aligned,
  like\n    Ledger\n\nExtra commands:\n\n-   hledger-equity: fix end date in title;
  print closing entry too\n-   hledger-check-dates: added\n\n0.23.3 (2014/9/12)\n\n-
  \  allow text 1.2+ (#207)\n\n0.23.2 (2014/5/8)\n\n-   register: also fix date sorting
  of postings (#184)\n\n0.23.1 (2014/5/7)\n\n-   register: fix a refactoring-related
  regression that the tests\n    missed: if transactions were not ordered by date
  in the journal,\n    register could include postings before the report start date
  in the\n    output. (#184)\n-   add: don't apply a default commodity to amounts
  on entry (#138)\n-   cli: options before the add-on command name are now also passed
  to it (#182)\n-   csv: allow the first name in a fields list to be empty (#178)\n-
  \  csv: don't validate fields count in skipped lines (#177)\n\n0.23 (2014/5/1)\n\nJournal
  format:\n\n-   A # (hash) in column 0 is now also supported for starting a top-level
  journal comment, like Ledger.\n-   The \"too many missing amounts\" error now reminds
  about the 2-space rule.\n-   Fix: . (period) is no longer parsed as a valid amount.\n-
  \  Fix: default commodity directives no longer limit the maximum display precision
  (#169).\n-   Fix: + before an amount is no longer parsed as part of the commodity
  (#181).\n\nCLI:\n\n-   Command-line help cleanups, layout improvements.\n-   Descriptions
  are shown for known add-ons in the command list.\n-   Command aliases have been
  simplified.\n-   Add-ons can now have any of these file extensions:\n    none, hs,
  lhs, pl, py, rb, rkt, sh, bat, com, exe.\n-   Add-ons are displayed without their
  file extensions when possible.\n-   Add-ons with the same name as a built-in command
  or alias are ignored.\n-   Fix: add-on detection and invocation now works on windows.\n-
  \  Fix: add-ons with digits in the name are now found.\n-   Fix: add-on arguments
  containing a single quote now work.\n-   Fix: when -- is used to hide add-on options
  from the main program,\n    it is no longer passed through as an add-on argument.\n\nQueries:\n\n-
  \  The currency/commodity query prefix (sym:) has been renamed to cur:.\n-   Currency/commodity
  queries are applied more strongly in register and\n    balance reports, filtering
  out unwanted currencies entirely. Eg\n    hledger balance cur:'$' now reports only
  the dollar amounts even if\n    there are multi-currency transactions or postings.\n-
  \  Amount queries like amt:N, amt:<N and amt:>N, where N is not 0, now do an unsigned\n
  \   comparison of the amount and N. That is, they compare the absolute magnitude.\n
  \   To do a signed comparison instead, write N with its sign (eg amt:+N, amt:<+N,
  amt:>-N).\n-   Fix: amount queries no longer give false positives on multi-commodity
  amounts.\n\naccounts:\n\n-   An accounts command has been added, similar to Ledger's,
  for listing account names\n    in flat or hierarchical mode.\n\nadd:\n\n-   Tab
  completion now works at all prompts, and will insert the default if the input area
  is empty.\n-   Account and amount defaults are more robust and useful.\n-   Transactions
  may also be completed by the enter key, when there are no more default postings.\n-
  \  Input prompts are displayed in a different colour when supported.\n\nbalance:\n\n-
  \  Balance reports in flat mode now always show exclusive (subaccount-excluding)
  balances.\n-   Balance reports in flat mode with --depth now aggregate deeper accounts
  at the depth limit instead of excluding them.\n-   Multicolumn reports in flat mode
  now support --drop.\n-   Multicolumn balance reports can now show the account hierarchy
  with --tree.\n-   Multicolumn report start/end dates are adjusted to encompass the
  displayed\n    report periods, so the first and last periods are \"full\" and comparable
  to the others.\n-   Fix: zero-balance leaf accounts below a non-zero-balance parent
  are no longer always shown (#170).\n-   Fix: multicolumn reports now support --date2
  (cf #174).\n\nbalancesheet, cashflow, incomestatement:\n\n-   These commands now
  support --flat and --drop.\n\nprint:\n\n-   Tag queries (tag:) will now match a
  transaction if any of its postings match.\n\nregister:\n\n-   The --display option
  has been dropped. To see an accurate running total which\n    includes the prior
  starting balance, use --historical/-H (like balance).\n-   With a report interval,
  report start/end dates are adjusted to encompass the displayed\n    periods, so
  the first and last periods are \"full\" and comparable to the others.\n-   Fix:
  --date2 now works with report intervals (fixes #174).\n\nMiscellaneous:\n\n-   Default
  report dates now derive from the secondary dates when --date2 is in effect.\n-   Default
  report dates now notice any posting dates outside the transaction dates' span.\n-
  \  Debug output improvements.\n-   New add-on example: extra/hledger-rewrite.hs,
  adds postings to matched entries.\n-   Compatible with GHC 7.2 (#155) - GHC 7.8,
  shakespeare 2\n\n0.22.2 (2014/4/16)\n\n-   display years before 1000 with four digits,
  not three\n-   avoid pretty-show to build with GHC < 7.4\n-   allow text 1.1, drop
  data-pprint to build with GHC 7.8.x\n\n0.22.1 (2014/1/6) and older: see https://hledger.org/release-notes
  or doc/release-notes.md.\n"
