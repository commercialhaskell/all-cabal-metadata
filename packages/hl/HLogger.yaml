  HLogger is a simple and concurrent logging utility for Haskell under the
  development by the Pontarius project. The goal is to provide a name and facility
  for a set of logging functionalities that many Haskell developers re-invent and
  maintain their own implementations of. We are not entirely sure yet what the
  scope of this library will be, but we will continue to evolve it in parallel
  with the development of Pontarius and HXMPP, utilizing it in those two projects.
  One specific feature that we are looking into is a plug-in system for customized
  logger behaviors.

  See <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/HLogger/> for more information.

  Please note that we are <em>not</em> recommending anyone to use HLogger at this
  time as it's still in an experimental stage and will have its API and data types
  modified frequently. We have scheduled the first beta release for the 4th of
  May. That being said, if you are interested to use HLogger anyway, feel free to
  do so and to contact the Pontarius project if you need any assistance.

  We will release the next version, 0.1 Alpha 2, on the 23rd of March.
