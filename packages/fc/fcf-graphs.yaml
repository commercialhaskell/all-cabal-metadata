  # fcf-graphs

  fcf-graphs mimicks
  [algebraic-graphs](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs) but
  for type level computations using
  [first-class-families](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/first-class-families).

  Provided are the `Graph` and `AdjacencyMap` data types, and several functions
  for each. I believe this can reach api parity with algebraic-graphs. At the
  moment, not everything is implemented, but type-level `simplify` works which is
  interesting.

  Note that ordering of underlying lists/maps is a bit weird so be careful. See
  the doctests for examples, and see
  [fcf-containers](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fcf-containers) for
  reference.
