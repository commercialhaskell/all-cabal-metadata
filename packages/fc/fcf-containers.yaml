description: "# fcf-containers [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/fcf-containers.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fcf-containers)
  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gspia/fcf-containers.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/gspia/fcf-containers)\n\nFcf-containers
  mimicks the containers package but for type-level computations. \nThat is, we provide
  e.g. trees and maps. In addition to that, this package \ncontains some other type-level
  computation utilities. \n\nThese methods are based on the idea given in the\n[first-class-families](https://github.com/Lysxia/first-class-families)
  -package,\nor Fcf shortly. Fcf is the main dependency of fcf-containers. As some
  of the\nmethods fit badly under the name \"fcf-containers\", they might end up into
  \nthe Fcf or some other package to be created. So stay tuned, be patient, check
  \nthe [TODO.md](https://github.com/gspia/fcf-containers/blob/master/TODO.md) \nand
  send those PR's :)\n\n\nMotivation for calculating things on type-level or on compile-time
  \ninclude\n\n- increase the safety measures of runtime methods,\n- pre-calculate
  complex things once on compile time and not every time the\n  executable is run,
  \n- provide users a way to choose between different algorithms for solving\n  a
  problem based on problem instance properties (e.g. local vs network,\n  or small
  vs large) known in advance.\n \nWhy fcf-like? The kind of signatures used for functions
  might be easier to \nread for some people and the ability to apply partially a function
  is nice \ntool to have. The techniques that allows this are defunctionalization,
  \nencoding the functions with empty data types and the use of open type family \nto
  Eval the constructed expressions. \n \nIf you have other motivations, please do
  let us know! \n\nNote: some of the claims on the items in the above list are such
  that I \nbelieve/hope but really don't know at the moment nor do I know how check
  them. \nE.g. the matter of compile time vs run time. Yes, types are erased at compile
  \ntime but do they still leave something into executables: simple check by \ncomparing
  outputs of the orbit example and another program that has one method \nto print
  integer 42 and main, reveals that sizes are almost the same, but not \nexactly.\n\n\nThere
  are lot of open interesting questions. See \n[TODO.md](https://github.com/gspia/fcf-containers/blob/master/TODO.md)
  file. E.g. how combine \nthese techniques with singletons-lib and related techniques.
  \n\n\n\n## Installation and building \n\nFirst, get the repo with `git clone` and
  `cd` into the directory. \n\n```\nnix-shell \ncabal build \ncabal test \n```\n\nThe
  doc-tests both document and work as main testing mechanism for this lib. \n\nIf
  you don't use nix, `cabal install fcf-containers` should be enough. This\npackage
  has almost as good number of dependencies as the first-class-families.\n\n\n## Example\n\nSee
  [Orbits.hs](https://github.com/gspia/fcf-containers/blob/master/examples/Orbits.hs).
  \nIt shows how to solve a real problem,\nwhat PRAGMAs are probably needed etc.\n\n```\ncabal
  run orbits \n```\n\nThere is also another example that show how to use MapC, see\n[Haiku.hs](https://github.com/gspia/fcf-containers/blob/master/examples/Haiku.hs)\n\n```\ncabal
  run haiku \n```\n\n\n## Random Notes\n\n### Partiality and anonymous functions\n\nIn
  the end, everything has to be total. We just post-pone the totality checking\nwith
  defunctionalization in a way by trying to evaluate our functions as late\nas possible
  with the `Eval` function. \n\nWe don't have lambdas, but if you can write the helper
  function in point-free\nform, it might can be used directly without any global function
  definition.\nRemember, that `(<=<)` corresponds to term-level `(.)` and `(=<<)`
  to \nterm-level function  application `($)`. See also Maguire's book \n(Thinking
  with Types).\n\n\n### Conflicting family instance declarations\n\nTransforming term-level
  Haskell code is relatively straigthforward. Often, \nlocal definitions in `where`
  and anonymous functions will be turned into \nseparate helper functions. \n\nOccasionally,
  the pattern matching is not quite enough. Please, consider\n\n```\nisPrefixOf              ::
  (Eq a) => [a] -> [a] -> Bool\nisPrefixOf [] _         =  True\nisPrefixOf _  []
  \       =  False\nisPrefixOf (x:xs) (y:ys)=  x == y && isPrefixOf xs ys\n```\n\nWe
  could try to define it as \n```\ndata IsPrefixOf :: [a] -> [a] -> Exp Bool\ntype
  instance Eval (IsPrefixOf '[] _) = 'True\ntype instance Eval (IsPrefixOf _ '[])
  = 'False\ntype instance Eval (IsPrefixOf (x ': xs) (y ': ys)) =\n         Eval ((Eval
  (TyEq x y)) && Eval (IsPrefixOf xs ys))\n```\n\nBut ghc does not like this definition:
  the first two type instances are\nconflicting together. Instead, in these situations
  we can use a helper type \nfamily:\n\n```\ndata IsPrefixOf :: [a] -> [a] -> Exp
  Bool\ntype instance Eval (IsPrefixOf xs ys) = IsPrefixOf_ xs ys\n\n-- helper for
  IsPrefixOf\ntype family IsPrefixOf_ (xs :: [a]) (ys :: [a]) :: Bool where\n    IsPrefixOf_
  '[] _ = 'True\n    IsPrefixOf_ _ '[] = 'False\n    IsPrefixOf_ (x ': xs) (y ': ys)
  =\n         Eval ((Eval (TyEq x y)) && IsPrefixOf_ xs ys)\n```\n\n### Using `If`\n\nIf
  possible, try to avoid using `Eval` in the if-branches. \nFor example, consider\n```\n
  \   (If (Eval (s > 0) )\n        ( 'Just '( a, s TL.- 1 ))\n        'Nothing\n    )\n```\nand\n```\n
  \   (If (Eval (s > 0))\n        (Eval (Pure ( 'Just '( a, s TL.- 1 ))))\n        (Eval
  (Pure 'Nothing))\n    )\n```\n\nBoth compile and it is easy to end up in the latter
  form, especially if the \nbranch is more complex than in this example. \n\nThe former,
  however, is much better as it doesn't have to evaluate both branches\nand is thus
  more efficient.\n\n\n### Other\n\n\nThe `ghci` and `:kind!` command are your friends!\n\nSource
  also contains a lot of examples, see\n[fcf-containers](https://github.com/gspia/fcf-containers/tree/master/src/Fcf).\n\n\nHappy
  :kinding!\n"
