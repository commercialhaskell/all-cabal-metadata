changelog: "\n# 0.8.2\n\nThank you again to Skyfold (Martin P.)\n\n- Deprecation warning
  for the KnownNats class and its instances: the KnownVal\n  can be used instead.\n-
  Instances to IntMap, Map and Set to convert directly from '[a] or '[ '(key,val)
  ]\n- The ErrorMessage instance for KnownVal to show information about types \n-
  Add KnownVal instance for typeable types, this can be used as Show for\n  the types
  presented at the kind level. \n- Fix the Test.Alg test description\n- Remove doc-tests
  from all Fcf.Alg modules and write the corresponding test modules\n- Some cleaning\n-
  Add depracation and warning pragmas to text modules.\n\n\n# 0.8.1\n\n20230410\n\nThank
  you to Skyfold (Martin P.)\n\n- Generalized KnownVal instances\n- Initialized the
  HSpec use and test directory organization\n- Added flake definitions\n- Updated
  stack version (not tested with stack)\n- Removed shell.nix\n- Fcf.Data.Set doctests
  removed and replaced with Test.Data.Set\n- Fcf.Alg.List doctests removed and replaced
  with Test.Alg.List\n\n\n# 0.8.0\n\n20230226\n\n- Fcf.Data.Char for GHC 9.2.X or
  higher, the Text will start using this.\n- Fcf.Data.Tuple with Swap method\n- Fcf.Data.Reflect
  gives methods to turn type-level structures into value-level.\n  These include instances
  for trees, natMaps, maps, lists, and text. Text instances\n  are only for GHC 9.2.X
  or higher.\n- Fcf.Data.Symbol for GHC 9.2.x or higher, the Text will start using
  this.\n- Deprecate the current Text and Text.Internal modules and introduce new
  using\n  the Symbol module (these are for GHC 9.2.x or higher).\n- Add new dependencies,
  containers and text (for the Reflect module).\n- Several hlint suggestion fixes
  included\n\nThe \"NewText\" module could have more methods that the counterpart
  already has.\nAlso, the Reflect module could have more typical instances.\n\nThe
  test will be moved into the test directory and away from the doctests, which\nin
  turn, will be deprecated. The doctests would be otherwise nice, but they are\ndifficult
  (laborous) to support for several different ghc versions.\n\nThis also includes
  Data.List.Utils and there Foldl and MaybeToList methods.\n\n\n# 0.7.2\n\n2023015\n\n-
  Add notes about defunctionalization and associated code examples\n- Add helper module
  for Foldl method (it would be better at first-class-families lib).\n\n# 0.7.1\n\n20220601\n\n
  - Clean up several modules (remove extra spaces and paranthesis)\n - Update doctest
  function and remove Glob dependency\n - Update ci pipeline to do tests with 9.0
  and 9.2\n\n# 0.7.0\n\n20220424\n\n - Add preliminary support for Applicative and
  Monadic computations\n - Small whitespace fixes\n - Added dependency for mtl (to
  get Identity)\n - Add new compiler versions for tests and drop some old\n - Start
  referring to cabal version 3.0\n\n# 0.6.1\n\n20210130\n\nStart using the github
  actions and remove travis CI.\n\n# 0.6.0\n\n20210130\n\n - use symbol as text representation
  (we can split predefined char-sets, as shown\n   by the Csongor at https://kcsongor.github.io/symbol-parsing-haskell/
  see also\n   the symbols-package)\n - and hie.yaml (for language server)\n - minor
  documentation fixes\n - add new example that really stresses ghc (Advent-of-code
  2020, day 22b)\n - MToN to Alg.List (this generates Nat-list from M to N)\n - Nat

description: "# fcf-containers [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/fcf-containers.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fcf-containers)
  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gspia/fcf-containers.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/gspia/fcf-containers)\n\nFcf-containers
  mimicks the containers package but for type-level computations. \nThat is, we provide
  e.g. trees and maps. In addition to that, this package \ncontains some other type-level
  computation utilities. \n\nThese methods are based on the idea given in the\n[first-class-families](https://github.com/Lysxia/first-class-families)
  -package,\nor Fcf shortly. Fcf is the main dependency of fcf-containers. As some
  of the\nmethods fit badly under the name \"fcf-containers\", they might end up into
  \nthe Fcf or some other package to be created. So stay tuned, be patient, check
  \nthe [TODO.md](https://github.com/gspia/fcf-containers/blob/master/TODO.md) \nand
  send those PR's :)\n\n\nMotivation for calculating things on type-level or on compile-time
  \ninclude\n\n- increase the safety measures of runtime methods,\n- pre-calculate
  complex things once on compile time and not every time the\n  executable is run,
  \n- provide users a way to choose between different algorithms for solving\n  a
  problem based on problem instance properties (e.g. local vs network,\n  or small
  vs large) known in advance.\n \nWhy fcf-like? The kind of signatures used for functions
  might be easier to \nread for some people and the ability to apply partially a function
  is nice \ntool to have. The techniques that allows this are defunctionalization,
  \nencoding the functions with empty data types and the use of open type family \nto
  Eval the constructed expressions. \n \nIf you have other motivations, please do
  let us know! \n\nNote: some of the claims on the items in the above list are such
  that I \nbelieve/hope but really don't know at the moment nor do I know how check
  them. \nE.g. the matter of compile time vs run time. Yes, types are erased at compile
  \ntime but do they still leave something into executables: simple check by \ncomparing
  outputs of the orbit example and another program that has one method \nto print
  integer 42 and main, reveals that sizes are almost the same, but not \nexactly.\n\n\nThere
  are lot of open interesting questions. See \n[TODO.md](https://github.com/gspia/fcf-containers/blob/master/TODO.md)
  file. E.g. how combine \nthese techniques with singletons-lib and related techniques.
  \n\n\n\n## Installation and building \n\nFirst, get the repo with `git clone` and
  `cd` into the directory. \n\n```\nnix-shell \ncabal build \ncabal test \n```\n\nIf
  you are flakes user, `nix develop -c zsh` (or without that `-c zsh`) works as well.\n\nThe
  doc-tests both document and work partly as testing mechanism for this lib. Please
  \ndo note that we are moving away from the doc-tests and building the testing modules
  \nunder `test` directory.\n\nIf you don't use nix, `cabal install fcf-containers`
  should be enough. This\npackage has almost as good number of dependencies as the
  first-class-families.\n\n\n## Example\n\n\n### Test cases as examples\n\nThe  \n[test
  directory](https://github.com/gspia/fcf-containers/blob/master/test)\ncontains a
  lot of useful examples.  There you will find out, how to apply most\nof the methods:
  examples that only work on \"compile time\", and examples on how\nto get the results
  from type level calculations to value level (see the Reflect\ntest module and the
  `fromType` method applications, also in some other testing\nmodules).\n\n\n### Three
  example programs calculating something\n\nThese are a bit larger examples, but not
  yet too large: somewhat convenient small \nmodule size.  Idea was to take an algorithm,
  and convert it to a type-level \ncomputation, or in some other way give an example
  of methods that this library\nprovides.\n\n\nSee [Orbits.hs](https://github.com/gspia/fcf-containers/blob/master/examples/Orbits.hs).
  \nIt shows how to solve a real problem,\nwhat PRAGMAs are probably needed etc.\n\n```\ncabal
  run orbits \n```\n\nThere is also another Advent of Code problem, see the Carbcombat
  file.\n\n\nTo see, how to use MapC, take a look at\n[Haiku.hs](https://github.com/gspia/fcf-containers/blob/master/examples/Haiku.hs)\n\n```\ncabal
  run haiku \n```\n\n\n### Other example material\n\nPlease, do take a look of the
  notes made for the Helsinki Haskell meetup\non 11th January 2023\n[notes](https://github.com/gspia/fcf-containers/blob/master/examples/20230111_hhslides.md)\nand
  the associated \n[code examples](https://github.com/gspia/fcf-containers/blob/master/examples/20230111_hhmeetup.hs).\n\n\n\n##
  Random Notes\n\n### Partiality and anonymous functions\n\nIn the end, everything
  has to be total. We just post-pone the totality checking\nwith defunctionalization
  in a way by trying to evaluate our functions as late\nas possible with the `Eval`
  function. \n\nWe don't have lambdas, but if you can write the helper function in
  point-free\nform, it might can be used directly without any global function definition.\nRemember,
  that `(<=<)` corresponds to term-level `(.)` and `(=<<)` to \nterm-level function
  application `($)`. See also Maguire's book \n(Thinking with Types).\n\n\n### Conflicting
  family instance declarations\n\nTransforming term-level Haskell code is relatively
  straigthforward. Often, \nlocal definitions in `where` and anonymous functions will
  be turned into \nseparate helper functions. \n\nOccasionally, the pattern matching
  is not quite enough. Please, consider\n\n```\nisPrefixOf              :: (Eq a)
  => [a] -> [a] -> Bool\nisPrefixOf [] _         =  True\nisPrefixOf _  []        =
  \ False\nisPrefixOf (x:xs) (y:ys)=  x == y && isPrefixOf xs ys\n```\n\nWe could
  try to define it as \n```\ndata IsPrefixOf :: [a] -> [a] -> Exp Bool\ntype instance
  Eval (IsPrefixOf '[] _) = 'True\ntype instance Eval (IsPrefixOf _ '[]) = 'False\ntype
  instance Eval (IsPrefixOf (x ': xs) (y ': ys)) =\n         Eval ((Eval (TyEq x y))
  && Eval (IsPrefixOf xs ys))\n```\n\nBut ghc does not like this definition: the first
  two type instances are\nconflicting together. Instead, in these situations we can
  use a helper type \nfamily:\n\n```\ndata IsPrefixOf :: [a] -> [a] -> Exp Bool\ntype
  instance Eval (IsPrefixOf xs ys) = IsPrefixOf_ xs ys\n\n-- helper for IsPrefixOf\ntype
  family IsPrefixOf_ (xs :: [a]) (ys :: [a]) :: Bool where\n    IsPrefixOf_ '[] _
  = 'True\n    IsPrefixOf_ _ '[] = 'False\n    IsPrefixOf_ (x ': xs) (y ': ys) =\n
  \        Eval ((Eval (TyEq x y)) && IsPrefixOf_ xs ys)\n```\n\n### Using `If`\n\nIf
  possible, try to avoid using `Eval` in the if-branches. \nFor example, consider\n```\n
  \   (If (Eval (s > 0) )\n        ( 'Just '( a, s TL.- 1 ))\n        'Nothing\n    )\n```\nand\n```\n
  \   (If (Eval (s > 0))\n        (Eval (Pure ( 'Just '( a, s TL.- 1 ))))\n        (Eval
  (Pure 'Nothing))\n    )\n```\n\nBoth compile and it is easy to end up in the latter
  form, especially if the \nbranch is more complex than in this example. \n\nThe former,
  however, is much better as it doesn't have to evaluate both branches\nand is thus
  more efficient.\n\n\n### Other\n\n\nThe `ghci` and `:kind!` command are your friends!\n\nSource
  also contains a lot of examples, see\n[fcf-containers](https://github.com/gspia/fcf-containers/tree/master/src/Fcf).\nThe
  examples will be left near the code, even thou the doctest runs will be \nremoved
  and replaced with real tests at the test-directory.\n\nHappy :kinding!\n"
