  # fcf-vinyl

  Vinyl compatibility with
  [first-class-families](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/first-class-families).
  Exports a version of `rappend` which uses the fcf version of `(++)` rather than
  the version in `Data.Vinyl.TypeLevel`. This makes it easier to prove things via
  the fcf.

  If there are more ways to ease compatibility with FCF, they will be added here.
