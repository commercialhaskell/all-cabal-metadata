  # quickselect

  Haskell implementation of introselect on vectors.

  This package provides three selection algorithms on both boxed and unboxed vectors.

  The first is quickselect: this is an O(n) selection algorithm, with very fast performance in practice, but an unfortunate O(n^2) worst-case time.

  The second is median-of-medians: this has an O(n) worst-case time, but usually performs worse than quickselect in practice.

  The final is introselect: this begins as quickselect, but switches to median-of-medians if it realizes it's in one of the pathalogical cases which causes O(n^2) time. It has O(n) worst-case time, and performance in practice very close to quickselect.

  There are also machine-generate optimal selection and median-finding functions for inputs of size 3, 4, and 5.
