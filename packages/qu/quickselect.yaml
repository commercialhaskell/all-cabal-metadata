  # quickselect


  Haskell implementation of introselect on vectors.


  This package provides three selection algorithms on both boxed and unboxed vectors.


  The first is quickselect: this is an O(n) selection algorithm, with very fast performance
  in practice, but an unfortunate O(n^2) worst-case time.


  The second is median-of-medians: this has an O(n) worst-case time, but usually performs
  worse than quickselect in practice.


  The final is introselect: this begins as quickselect, but switches to median-of-medians
  if it realizes it''s in one of the pathalogical cases which causes O(n^2) time.
  It has O(n) worst-case time, and performance in practice very close to quickselect.


  There are also machine-generate optimal selection and median-finding functions for
  inputs of size 3, 4, and 5.
