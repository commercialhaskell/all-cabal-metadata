description: |-
  Quelea is a Haskell library that helps programmers develop highly
  scalable applications on the top of eventually consistent NoSQL stores,
  such as Cassandra. You can think of Quelea as a mediator between the
  application programmer and the underlying NoSQL store. It understands both
  the application requirements and the store semantics, and helps
  programmers use NoSQL stores in such a way so as to maximize performance
  and ensure correct application behaviour, both at the same time!  Among
  other things, Quelea library implements:

  A Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that lets NoSQL application programmers
  declare the consistency requirements of their applications as contracts
  (also called specifications)

  A static contract classification procedure that maps high-level
  application contracts to appropriate low-level consistency guarantees
  provided by the underlying NoSQL store, and

  A run-time that runs application operations after tuning the
  store consistency to appropriate levels as determined by the
  contract classification procedure.  While the
  implementations of DSL and the static contract
  classification components are largely independent of the
  actual NoSQL store used, the current implementation of
  run-time component is tailor-made to work with the Cassandra
  data store.
