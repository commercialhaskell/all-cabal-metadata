synopsis: Utility libraries for Quipper.
changelog: "December 29, 2019: Release 0.9.0.0\n\n * Overhauled module structure:\n
  \n   Old:                New:\n   ====                ====\n   \n   Quipper.XYZ
  \        Quipper.Internal.XYZ\n   QuipperLib.XYZ      Quipper.Libraries.XYZ\n   Libraries.XYZ
  \      Quipper.Utils.XYZ\n   Algorithms.XYZ      Quipper.Algorithms.XYZ\n   tests
  \              Quipper.Demos\n   Programs            Quipper.Programs\n\n * Re-packaged
  Quipper as Cabal packages. Added executables quipper,\n   quipper-pp, quipperi,
  quipperdoc in lieu of shell scripts.\n * Moved PDF Previewer to a separate library
  in Quipper.Utils.Preview\n * Added a MonadFail instance to Circ, to keep ghc >=
  7.4 happy\n * Use type class synonyms to avoid warnings about simplifiable class.\n
  * Compatibility: removed obsolete functoin Map.insertWith'.\n * Added MultiControlledNot
  demo.\n * Removed dependency on set-monad, which is broken upstream.\n * Fixed some
  bugs in the stabilizer simulation.\n * Moved QuantumIf from BF to Libraries.\n *
  Added --help option to all Quipper tools.\n * Removed Quipper.Utils.ShowAll\n *
  Fixed some compiler errors and removed some unnecessary type class\n   assumptions.\n\nJuly
  27, 2016: Release 0.8\n\n * Portability: compatibility fixes for GHC 8.0. Note:
  GHC 7.10 is too\n   broken and will not be supported by Quipper.\n * Added tests/SimulationTest\n
  * Added QPrep and QUnPrep to the simulator\n\nOctober 14, 2014: Release 0.7\n\n
  * Portability: compatibility fixes for GHC 7.8.\n\nJanuary 16, 2014: Release 0.6\n\n
  * Minor edits and documentation updates.\n * Added a new gate gate_iX_inv\n * Added
  \"alternate\" version of synthesis algorithm, using only\n   generators of determinant
  1 if possible.\n * Synthesis code is now in an external package \"newsynth\".\n
  * Rendering code is now in an external package \"easyrender\".\n * Updated for use
  with fixedprec-0.2.1.0.\n\nSeptember 2, 2013: Release 0.5\n\n * Portability: compatibility
  fixes for GHC 7.6.2.\n * Portability: fixed Windows incompatibility bug. Handling
  of Ctrl-C\n   may or may not work on Windows, depending on console.\n * Added quipperi
  script, analogous to ghci.\n * New library QuipperLib.ClassicalOptim: algebraic
  optimization of\n   auto-generated classical circuits. Added \"optimized\" oracle
  to BWT\n   algorithm.\n * QuipperLib.Decompose: Added decomposition into a \"standard\"
  gate\n   set, consisting of X, Y, Z, H, S, S-dagger, T, T-dagger, and CNOT.\n   Added
  KeepPhase flag to some transformers.\n * QuipperLib.GateDecompositions: added more
  gates.\n * New library Libraries.Synthesis.RotationDecomposition: implements a\n
  \  variant of the algorithm from Nielsen and Chuang to decompose an\n   nxn unitary
  operator into one- and two-level rotations.\n * New library QuipperLib.Unboxing:
  unboxing transformers.\n * Updated ASCII output format; improved circuit parser
  efficiency.\n * Miscellaneous bug fixes: malformed W-gates, qdata_of_qubits,\n   floorlog.\n
  * Fixed handling of iterated subroutines in depth transformer.\n * Documentation
  updates and minor refactoring.\n\nJune 19, 2013: Release 0.4\n\n * First public
  release.\n"

  This package provides some utility libraries for Quipper, the
  embedded functional programming language for quantum computing. These
  libraries are used by Quipper, but do not depend on it. They provide
  general-purpose functionality that could in principle be used by
  other programs, but are are not sufficiently interesting to warrant
  their own packages.
