  # Changelog

  All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

  The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to  [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

  As a minor extension, we also keep a semantic version for the `UNRELEASED`
  changes.

  ## 4.0.1 - 2025-07-14

  * Added support for `Quickcheck-2.16`.

  ## 4.0.0 - 2025-03-12

  * **BREAKING**: Removed `Realized`
    - To migrate uses of `Realized` with `IOSim`, index the state type on the choice of `RunModel` monad
      and index the relevant types:
      ```
      -- Turn:
      data ModelState = State { threadId :: Var ThreadId }
      -- Into:
      data ModelState m = State { threadId :: Var (ThreadId m) }
      ```
  * **BREAKING**: Moved `Error state` from `StateModel` to `RunModel` and indexed it on both the `state` and the monad `m`
  * **BREAKING**: Changed `PerformResult` from `PerformResult (Error state) a` to `PerformResult state m a`
  * Added a `moreActions` property modifier to allow controlling the length of action sequences.

  ## 3.4.1 - 2024-03-22

  * [#70](https://github.com/input-output-hk/quickcheck-dynamic/pull/70) Expose `IsPerformResult` typeclass

  ## 3.4.0 - 2024-03-01

  * Added some lightweight negative-shrinking based on a simple dependency analysis.
  * Added the option to return errors from actions by defining `type Error state`.
    When this is defined `perform` has return type `m (Either (Error state) (Realized m a))`,
    when it is left as the default the type remains `m (Realized m a)`.
  * Changed `withGenQ` to _require_ a predicate when defining a `Quantification`. **Note**: This is technically a breaking change as the interface changed

  ## 3.3.1

  * Adapt code to _not_ constrain [mtl](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl) version too much

  ## 3.3.0

  * Added suppport for GHC 9.6.2 compiler

  ## 3.2.0

  * Added support for negative testing via `validFailingAction` and `postconditionOnFailure`
    callbacks in `StateModel` and `RunModel`.

  ## 3.1.1 - 2023-06-26

  * Added instances for `HasVariables` with custom error messages to avoid the issue of
    missing `Generic` instances causing difficult to understand type errors.

  ## 3.1.0 - 2023-04-10

  * **BREAKING**: Change the type of `postcondition` to allow you to
    express property monitoring (e.g. stats or counterexamples) in the
    postcondition itself - rather than duplicating code for counterexamples
    in the `monitoring` function.

  ## 3.0.3 - 2023-04-18

  * Added `hasNoVariablesQ` and `forAllNonVariableDL` functions to help make
    quantification require less boilerplate in `DL` properties.

  ## 3.0.2 - 2023-02-17

  * Added instances of `HasVariables` for Word types
  * Exported definition of `HasNoVariables` to make it useable
    with deriving via in downstream packages (whoops!)
  * Fixed impossible to use `nextVar` arguments to `forAllUniqueDL`

  ## 3.0.1 - 2023-02-15

  * Remove template haskell dependency

  ## 3.0.0 - 2023-02-14

  * **BREAKING**: Add `HasVariables` class to keep track of symbolic variables and automatically insert precondition
    checks for well-scopedness of variables.
  * **BREAKING**: Remove some unnecessary and unusead features in dynamic logic, including re-running tests from a
    counterexample directly.
  * Improved printing of counterexamples in DL - they are now printed as code that can be copied more-or-less verbatim to
    create a runnable counterexample in code.
  * Made the variable context explicit to avoid having to keep track of symbolic variables in the model
    * This introduces the `ctxAtType` and `arbitraryVar` functions to use in action generators (c.f. the
    `RegistryModel.hs` example).

  ## 2.0.0 - 2022-10-11

  * **BREAKING**: Add `Realized` type family to distinguish between the model- and real type of an action
  * **BREAKING**: Introduce `RunModel` type class to interpret Model-generated sequence of actions against real-world implementation
    * Move `perform` method from `StateModel` to this new type-class
    * Also split `postcondition` and `monitoring` out from the `StateModel` to the `RunModel` type class
  * Added Thread registry example based on io-sim concurrency simulation library

  ## 1.1.0 - 2022-08-27

  * Fix broken links in Hackage-generated documentation and link to other Quviq papers
  * Add `Show a` constraint on `monitoring`

  ## 1.0.0

  * Initial publication of quickcheck-dynamic library on Hackage
  * Provide base `StateModel` and `DynamicLogic` tools to write quickcheck-based models, express properties, and test them

  # quickcheck-dynamic

  A library for testing stateful programs using [QuickCheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck) and [dynamic logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_logic_(modal_logic)).

  ## Background

  This library was initially designed by [QuviQ](http://www.quviq.com/) in collaboration with
  [IOG](https://iohk.io/) to provide a dedicated test framework for [Plutus](https://docs.cardano.org/plutus/learn-about-plutus) "Smart
  contracts". As the need of a _Model-Based Testing_ framework arises in
  quite a lot of contexts, it was deemed useful to extract the most
  generic part as a standalone package with no strings attached to
  Plutus or Cardano.

  ## Usage

  * Documentation is currenly mostly provided inline as Haddock
    comments. Checkout [StateModel](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/quickcheck-dynamic/docs/src/Test.QuickCheck.StateModel.html)
    and [DynamicLogic](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/quickcheck-dynamic/docs/Test-QuickCheck-DynamicLogic.html) modules for
    some usage instructions.
  * For a concrete standalone example, have a look at the [`Registry`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/quickcheck-dynamic/blob/main/quickcheck-dynamic/test/Spec/DynamicLogic/Registry.hs) and [`RegistryModel`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/quickcheck-dynamic/blob/main/quickcheck-dynamic/test/Spec/DynamicLogic/RegistryModel.hs) module from the test suite, which respectively implement and model a multithreaded Thread registry inspired by the Erlang version of QuickCheck described in [this article](https://mengwangoxf.github.io/Papers/Erlang18.pdf)
  * For more documentation on how to quickcheck-dynamic is used to test
    Plutus DApps, check this
    [tutorial](https://plutus-apps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plutus/tutorials/contract-models.html).
  * Apart from Plutus, this library is now in use in the
    [Hydra](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc) project to
    verify the _Head Protocol_ implementation with respect to the
    original research paper.
