changelog: ! "# Changelog\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented
  in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)\nand
  this project adheres to the [Haskell Package Versioning Policy](https://pvp.haskell.org/).\n\n##
  [0.4.10] - 2018-05-03\n### Added\n- Property tests for `mconcat`, `sconcat`, and
  `stimes`. It isn't\n  common to override the defaults for these, but when you do,
  it's\n  nice to check that they agree with what they are supposed to do.\n\n## [0.4.9]
  - 2018-04-06\n### Change\n- Be more careful with import of `Data.Primitive`. There
  is a\n  branch of `primitive` that adds `PrimArray`. The implementation\n  of `PrimArray`
  in this library should eventually be removed, but\n  for now it will be sufficient
  to ensure that it does not create\n  a conflicting import problem with the one in
  the branch.\n\n## [0.4.8] - 2018-03-29\n### Change\n- Fix compilation regression
  for older versions of transformers.\n\n## [0.4.7] - 2018-03-29\n### Change\n- Split
  up monolithic module into hidden internal modules.\n- Fix compilation regression
  for older GHCs.\n\n## [0.4.6] - 2018-03-29\n### Added\n- Property test the naturality
  law for `MonadZip`. There is another law\n  that instances should satisfy (the Information
  Preservation law), but\n  it's more difficult to write a test for. It has been omitted
  for now.\n- Property tests for all `MonadPlus` laws.\n- Several additional property
  tests for list-like containers: mapMaybe,\n  replicate, filter.\n\n## [0.4.5] -
  2018-03-26\n### Added\n- Property tests for list-like containers that have `IsList`
  instances.\n  These are useful for things that are nearly `Foldable` or nearly `Traversable`\n
  \ but are either constrained in their element type or totally monomorphic\n  in
  it.\n\n## [0.4.4] - 2018-03-23\n### Added\n- Cabal flags for controlling whether
  or not `aeson` and `semigroupoids`\n  are used. These are mostly provided to accelerate
  builds `primitive`'s \n  test suite.\n\n## [0.4.3] - 2018-03-23\n### Added\n- Property
  tests for `foldl1` and `foldr1`.\n- Property tests for `Traversable`.\n\n## [0.4.2]
  - 2018-03-22\n### Changed\n- Made compatible with `transformers-0.3`. Tests for
  higher-kinded\n  typeclasses are unavailable when built with a sufficiently old\n
  \ version of both `transformers` and `base`. This is because `Eq1`\n  and `Show1`
  are unavailable in this situation.\n\n## [0.4.1] - 2018-03-21\n### Changed\n- Made
  compatible with `transformers-0.4`.\n\n## [0.4.0] - 2018-03-20\n### Added\n- Property
  tests for `Bifunctor` and `Alternative`.\n### Changed\n- Made compatible with older
  GHCs all the way back to 7.8.4.\n- Lower dependency footprint. Eliminate the dependency
  on `prim-array`\n  and inline the relevant functions and types from it into\n  `Test.QuickCheck.Classes`.
  None of these are exported.\n"
