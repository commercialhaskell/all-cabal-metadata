description: |-
  Contains several implementations of data structures implementing a /single-in, single-out/ paradigm.  Intended to be a better, more useful replacement for pqueue-mtl.
  In particular, includes an experimental and possibly genuinely new trie-based priority queue on strings.  Feedback is appreciated.
