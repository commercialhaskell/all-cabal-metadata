description: |
  `Essentials` is a small `Prelude` alternative. It was born out of the experience
  of maintaining a number of libraries that don't use a prelude at all, preferring
  instead to use tightly limited explicit imports. When we do this, we find that
  although the standard prelude contains many things that most modules can live
  without, there is a handful of items that most code truly needs.

  There are plenty of good reasons to use names that conflict with things in the
  standard prelude. For example, the standard prelude has a `takeWhile` function
  that deals with lists; a streaming library might define a function of the same
  name that deals with effectful streams. The standard prelude has a `log`
  function that is an abbreviation for 'logarithm'; a logging library might define
  a function of the same name that writes an event to a log file. Some names,
  however, are more sacrosanct. It would be generally unwise and unappreciated to
  define anything named `pure` or `(>>=)`, for example. The guiding principle for
  the `Essentials` module is that it includes things in the latter category.

  ## Function

  ```haskell
  ($) :: (a -> b) -> a -> b
  (&) :: a -> (a -> b) -> b
  ```

  `($)` and `(&)` are the same function, just flipped.
  `(&)` has slightly higher operator precedence.

  ## Category

  ```haskell
  id :: Category cat => cat a a
  (>>>) :: Category cat => cat a b -> cat b c -> cat a c
  (<<<), (.) :: Category cat => cat b c -> cat a b -> cat a c
  ```

  Usually specialized as `cat ~ (->)`:

  ```haskell
  id :: a -> a
  (>>>) :: (a -> b) -> (b -> c) -> a -> c
  (<<<), (.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
  ```

  `(>>>)` and `(<<<)` are the same function, just flipped.

  `(.)` is the same as `(<<<)`, but with higher operator precedence.

  ## Functor, Applicative, Monad

  ```haskell
  pure :: Applicative f => a -> f a
  ```

  ```haskell
  fmap, (<$>) :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
  (<&>) :: Functor f => f a -> (a -> b) -> f b
  ```

  `(<$>)` is the same as `fmap`.
  `(<$>)` and `(<&>)` are also the same function, just flipped.
  `(<$>)` has higher operator precedence.

  ```haskell
  (<*>) :: Applicative f => f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
  (<**>) :: Applicative f => f a -> f (a -> b) -> f b
  ```

  `(<*>)` and `(<**>)` are the same function, just flipped.

  ```haskell
  (>>=) :: Monad m => m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
  (=<<) :: Monad m => (a -> m b) -> m a -> m b

  (>=>) :: Monad m => (a -> m b) -> (b -> m c) -> a -> m c
  (<=<) :: Monad m => (b -> m c) -> (a -> m b) -> a -> m c
  ```

  `(>>=)` is left associative; `(=<<)` is right associative.

  These functions keep all effects but discard some values:

  ```haskell
  (<$) :: Functor f => a -> f b -> f a
  (<*) :: Applicative f => f a -> f b -> f a

  ($>) :: Functor f => f a -> b -> f b
  (*>) :: Applicative f => f a -> f b -> f b

  void :: Functor f => f a -> f ()
  ```

  ## Boole

  ```haskell
  data Bool = False | True

  otherwise = True
  ```

  ## Comparison

  ```haskell
  (==), (/=) :: Eq a => a -> a -> Bool

  (<), (>), (<=), (>=) :: Ord a => a -> a -> Bool
  ```

  ## Monoid

  ```haskell
  (<>) :: Semigroup a => a -> a -> a
  mempty :: Monoid a => a
  ```

  ## Traversal

  ```haskell
  traverse :: Traversable t => Applicative f =>
      (a -> f b) -> t a -> f (t b)

  traverse_ :: Foldable t => Applicative f =>
      (a -> f b) -> t a -> f ()
  ```

  ## Maybe

  ```haskell
  data Maybe a =
      Nothing | Just a
  ```

  ```haskell
  maybe :: b -> (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> b
  ```

  ## Void

  ```haskell
  data Void
  ```

  ```haskell
  absurd :: Void -> a
  ```

  ## Identity

  ```haskell
  newtype Identity a =
      Identity {runIdentity :: a}
  ```

  ## Const

  ```haskell
  newtype Const a b =
      Const {getConst :: a}
  ```

  infixr 1  =<<  <=<  >=>
                 <<<  >>>

  infixl 4  <$>  <$  $>
            <*>  *>  <*  <**>

  infix  4  ==  /=
            <   >
            <=  >=
