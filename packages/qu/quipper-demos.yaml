changelog: "December 29, 2019: Release 0.9.0.0\n\n * Overhauled module structure:\n
  \n   Old:                New:\n   ====                ====\n   \n   Quipper.XYZ
  \        Quipper.Internal.XYZ\n   QuipperLib.XYZ      Quipper.Libraries.XYZ\n   Libraries.XYZ
  \      Quipper.Utils.XYZ\n   Algorithms.XYZ      Quipper.Algorithms.XYZ\n   tests
  \              Quipper.Demos\n   Programs            Quipper.Programs\n\n * Re-packaged
  Quipper as Cabal packages. Added executables quipper,\n   quipper-pp, quipperi,
  quipperdoc in lieu of shell scripts.\n * Moved PDF Previewer to a separate library
  in Quipper.Utils.Preview\n * Added a MonadFail instance to Circ, to keep ghc >=
  7.4 happy\n * Use type class synonyms to avoid warnings about simplifiable class.\n
  * Compatibility: removed obsolete functoin Map.insertWith'.\n * Added MultiControlledNot
  demo.\n * Removed dependency on set-monad, which is broken upstream.\n * Fixed some
  bugs in the stabilizer simulation.\n * Moved QuantumIf from BF to Libraries.\n *
  Added --help option to all Quipper tools.\n * Removed Quipper.Utils.ShowAll\n *
  Fixed some compiler errors and removed some unnecessary type class\n   assumptions.\n\nJuly
  27, 2016: Release 0.8\n\n * Portability: compatibility fixes for GHC 8.0. Note:
  GHC 7.10 is too\n   broken and will not be supported by Quipper.\n * Added tests/SimulationTest\n
  * Added QPrep and QUnPrep to the simulator\n\nOctober 14, 2014: Release 0.7\n\n
  * Portability: compatibility fixes for GHC 7.8.\n\nJanuary 16, 2014: Release 0.6\n\n
  * Minor edits and documentation updates.\n * Added a new gate gate_iX_inv\n * Added
  \"alternate\" version of synthesis algorithm, using only\n   generators of determinant
  1 if possible.\n * Synthesis code is now in an external package \"newsynth\".\n
  * Rendering code is now in an external package \"easyrender\".\n * Updated for use
  with fixedprec-0.2.1.0.\n\nSeptember 2, 2013: Release 0.5\n\n * Portability: compatibility
  fixes for GHC 7.6.2.\n * Portability: fixed Windows incompatibility bug. Handling
  of Ctrl-C\n   may or may not work on Windows, depending on console.\n * Added quipperi
  script, analogous to ghci.\n * New library QuipperLib.ClassicalOptim: algebraic
  optimization of\n   auto-generated classical circuits. Added \"optimized\" oracle
  to BWT\n   algorithm.\n * QuipperLib.Decompose: Added decomposition into a \"standard\"
  gate\n   set, consisting of X, Y, Z, H, S, S-dagger, T, T-dagger, and CNOT.\n   Added
  KeepPhase flag to some transformers.\n * QuipperLib.GateDecompositions: added more
  gates.\n * New library Libraries.Synthesis.RotationDecomposition: implements a\n
  \  variant of the algorithm from Nielsen and Chuang to decompose an\n   nxn unitary
  operator into one- and two-level rotations.\n * New library QuipperLib.Unboxing:
  unboxing transformers.\n * Updated ASCII output format; improved circuit parser
  efficiency.\n * Miscellaneous bug fixes: malformed W-gates, qdata_of_qubits,\n   floorlog.\n
  * Fixed handling of iterated subroutines in depth transformer.\n * Documentation
  updates and minor refactoring.\n\nJune 19, 2013: Release 0.4\n\n * First public
  release.\n"
