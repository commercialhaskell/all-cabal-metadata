changelog: "quarantimer (1.20200422) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * When time for
  surface is not known, as with masks, say that it's not,\n    instead of using a
  1 year timeout.\n  * Added a stack.yaml file so it can be built using stack with
  a known\n    working set of packages.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Wed, 22
  Apr 2020 11:49:50 -0400\n\nquarantimer (1.20200326) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * Incorportated new research from \n    https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036673v1\n
  \   - Increase metal from 3 to 7 days (for stainless steel in particular)\n    -
  Add cloth, with 2 days\n    - Add paper, with 3 hours\n    - Add surgical mask,
  with 1 year timeout, as virus was still\n      detectable after 7 days and it is
  not known how long it would\n      remain infectious. It doesn't make sense to time-qurantine
  surgical\n      masks; they should be disinfected if necessary; they were added
  just\n      so people don't pick cloth for them and reuse after 2 days.\n  * Remove
  \"other\" choice. Existing timers for other will still last 72 hours.\n  * Once
  quarantine expires, show how long it's been since expiry in case the\n    user is
  feeling extra careful.\n  * Limit the allowed image formats to png, gif, jpg. In
  particular\n    don't accept video, which imagemagic would explode into one image\n
  \   per frame.\n  * Improve styling of form.\n  * Poll hourly to detect when the
  server has been restarted, and reload\n    the page so the most up-to-date version
  is displayed.\n  * Use webrtc to capture photo, less clunky and allows scaling client-side\n
  \   for faster upload.\n  * Display intersticial while uploading.\n\n -- Joey Hess

  The server is written in Haskell, build it with cabal or stack.
  You should edit Config.hs first.

  Imagemagick needs to be installed, it is used to process images.

  The first run, the server will fail to listen on https due to a missing
  certificate, but it will listen on http, so you can use certbot to get a
  letsencrypt certificate, and then restart the server.

  Note that https is needed for webrtc to work to take the photo.
  (localhost will work without https).

  Contact Joey Hess <joeyh@joey.name> by email with any bug reports,
  questions, or patches.
