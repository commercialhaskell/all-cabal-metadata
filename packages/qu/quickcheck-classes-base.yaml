  ## [0.6.0.0] - 2019-08-07
  ### Added
  - Initial release. This factor out a subset of laws tests
    from `quickcheck-classes` and depend on this library that
    have a more minimal dependency footprint.
  - Add laws for left rotate and right rotate.
  - Add law that checks that subtraction is the same thing as
    adding the negation of a number.

description: |-
  This libary is a minimal variant of `quickcheck-classes` that
  only provides laws for typeclasses from `base`. The main purpose
  of splitting this out is so that `primitive` can depend on
  `quickcheck-classes-base` in its test suite, avoiding the circular
  dependency that arises if `quickcheck-classes` is used instead.

  This library provides QuickCheck properties to ensure
  that typeclass instances adhere to the set of laws that
  they are supposed to. There are other libraries that do
  similar things, such as `genvalidity-hspec` and `checkers`.
  This library differs from other solutions by not introducing
  any new typeclasses that the user needs to learn.

  /Note:/ on GHC < 8.5, this library uses the higher-kinded typeclasses
  ('Data.Functor.Classes.Show1', 'Data.Functor.Classes.Eq1', 'Data.Functor.Classes.Ord1', etc.),
  but on GHC >= 8.5, it uses `-XQuantifiedConstraints` to express these
  constraints more cleanly.
