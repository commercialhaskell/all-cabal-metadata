  # Changelog
  All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

  The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
  and this project adheres to the [Haskell Package Versioning Policy](https://pvp.haskell.org/).

  Note that since `quickcheck-classes` reexports larges parts of
  `quickcheck-classes-base`, changelog entries that deal with any of the
  classes from `base` are duplicated across the two changelogs.

  ## [0.6.2.0] - 2021-04-12

  - Storable Set-Set Law (resolves issue 101).
  - Trim unneeded dependencies (tagged, base-orphans)
  - Trim unneeded dependencies on newer GHCs (bifunctors, contravariant)

  ## [0.6.1.0] - 2020-09-09
  ### Added
  - Laws for `abs` and `signum`
  - Storable Set-Set Law (resolves issue 101).
  - Add laws for `quotRem` and `divMod`.
  - Use non-commutative monoid for bifoldable tests (resolves issue 98)
  - `substitutiveEqLaws`, which tests for Eq substitutivity.
  - Negation law check for `Eq`.
  - Document that users can provide their own `Laws`.

  ## [0.6.0.0] - 2019-08-08
  ### Added
  - Initial release. This factor out a subset of laws tests
    from `quickcheck-classes` and depend on this library that
    have a more minimal dependency footprint.
  - Add laws for left rotate and right rotate.
  - Add law that checks that subtraction is the same thing as
    adding the negation of a number.

description: |-
  This libary is a minimal variant of `quickcheck-classes` that
  only provides laws for typeclasses from `base`. The main purpose
  of splitting this out is so that `primitive` can depend on
  `quickcheck-classes-base` in its test suite, avoiding the circular
  dependency that arises if `quickcheck-classes` is used instead.

  This library provides QuickCheck properties to ensure
  that typeclass instances adhere to the set of laws that
  they are supposed to. There are other libraries that do
  similar things, such as `genvalidity-hspec` and `checkers`.
  This library differs from other solutions by not introducing
  any new typeclasses that the user needs to learn.

  /Note:/ on GHC < 8.5, this library uses the higher-kinded typeclasses
  ('Data.Functor.Classes.Show1', 'Data.Functor.Classes.Eq1', 'Data.Functor.Classes.Ord1', etc.),
  but on GHC >= 8.5, it uses `-XQuantifiedConstraints` to express these
  constraints more cleanly.
