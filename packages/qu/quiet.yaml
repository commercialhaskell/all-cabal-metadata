  Generic deriving of `Read` / `Show` with no record labels.

  [![Hackage][hackage-shield]][hackage] [![Travis][travis-shield]][travis]

  Often one wants to create a `newtype` which has a convenient field
  accessor like `unUserId` below, but that makes the derived `Show`
  instance overly verbose.

  For example:

  ```hs
  newtype UserId = UserId { unUserId :: String } deriving (Show)
  ```

  Renders as:

  ```
  ghci> show (UserId "simon")
  UserId {unUserId = "simon"}
  ```

  With 'qshowsPrec' you can have a `Show` instance which doesn't print
  the field labels. It will render as if the `unUserId` accessor wasn't
  present at all.

  ```hs
  newtype UserId = UserId { unUserId :: String } deriving (Generic)

  instance Show UserId where showsPrec = qshowsPrec
  ```

  ```
  ghci> show (UserId "simon")
  UserId "simon"
  ```

  A compatible `Read` instance can also be derived using `qreadPrec` if
  necessary.

  ```hs
  instance Read UserId where showsPrec = qreadPrec
  ```
