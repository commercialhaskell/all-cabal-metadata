description: "You can convert some list to another one with just predefined set of
  values. \nUses some rounding techniques and recaps about quantum states superposition
  \n(therefore, the package's name).\n\n Devotion\n ========\n\nThe author would like
  to devote this project to support the [Foundation Gastrostars](https://gastrostars.nl).\n\nOn
  the 21/02/2024 there is an International Mother Tongue Day â€” that is Ukrainian for
  the author of the package. \n\nOn the 12/03/2024 there was a Birthday of Emma Kok,
  she turned 16. Therefore, the release 0.3.1.0 is dedicated i.e. tributed to her.\n\nBesides,
  you can support Ukrainian people in various forms.\n\nAll support is welcome, including
  donations for the needs of the Ukrainian army, IDPs and refugees. \n\nIf you would
  like to share some financial support with the Foundation Gastrostars, please, contact
  the mentioned foundation\nusing the URL:\n\n[Contact Foundation GASTROSTARS](https://gastrostars.nl/hou-mij-op-de-hoogte)\n\nor
