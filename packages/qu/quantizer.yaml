changelog: "# Revision history for quantizer\n\n## 0.1.0.0 -- 2022-09-13\n\n* First
  version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n## 0.2.0.0 -- 2023-01-24\n\n* Second

  version revised A. Applied the ideas of the foldl package and added a new module\nListQuantizer
  to be used in case of lists instead of FoldableQuantizer. Some documentation\nimprovements.\n\n##
  0.2.1.1 -- 2023-01-27\n\n* Second version revised B. Some documentation improvements.\n\n##
  0.3.0.0 -- 2023-04-18\n\n* Third version. Added README.md file. Removed the unneeded
  constraint for mean2F and related \nfunctions. Since the version 0.3.0.0, the project
  is devoted to fondation Gastrostars.\n\n## 0.3.0.1 -- 2023-04-18\n\n* Third version

description: "You can convert some list to another one with just predefined set of
  values. \nUses some rounding techniques and recaps about quantum states superposition
  \n(therefore, the package's name).\n\nDevotion\n========\n\nAuthor would like to
  devote this project to support the [Foundation\nGastrostars](https://gastrostars.nl).\nOn
  the 19/04/2023 there is the foundation founder's (that is [Emma Kok](https://emmakok.nl))
  \nnamesday, the memory of St. Emma of Lesum or Emma of Stiepel (also known as Hemma
  and Imma).\nIf you would like to share some financial support, please, contact the
  foundation\nusing the URL:\n\n[Contact Foundation GASTROSTARS](https://gastrostars.nl/hou-mij-op-de-hoogte)\n\n"
