description: "You can convert some list to another one with just predefined set of
  values. \nUses some rounding techniques and recaps about quantum states superposition
  \n(therefore, the package's name).\n\nYou can support Ukrainian people in various
  forms.\n\nAll support is welcome, including donations for the needs of the Ukrainian
  army, IDPs and refugees. \n\n"
