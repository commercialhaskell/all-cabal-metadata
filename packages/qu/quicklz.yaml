  # Fast compression for Haskell ByteStrings

  This library implements Haskell bindings to
  [QuickLZ](http://quicklz.com), a fast compression library. The
  interface is very simple:

  ```haskell
  compress    :: ByteString -> ByteString
  decompress  :: ByteString -> ByteString
  decompress' :: ByteString -> ByteString -- overlapping decompression
  ```

  As the name states, QuickLZ is fast - at both compression and
  decompression.  Per their own benchmarks, at compression level 1,
  QuickLZ 1.5.0 has a compression speed of 308Mbyte/s, and a
  decompression speed of 358Mbyte/s (their benchmarks, Core i7 920.)

  # TODO

  This package has some benchmarks and tests associated - I would like
  to expand the benchmarks to include bigger data sets in the future.

  There is currently only an interface for strict `ByteString`s.

  I would like to implement the streaming mode functionality sometime in
  the future, perhaps tying it to John Millikin's
  [enumerator](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/enumerator) package.
