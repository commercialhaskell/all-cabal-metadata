  quantities changelog
  ====================

  0.4 (unreleased)
  ----------------

  - Changed type of `Quantity` to `Quantity a`, where `a` is the type of the
    magnitude. Note that `a` should be an instance of `Floating` to get the most
    out of the available operations on quantities.
  - Added an executable that is an interface to `fromString`
  - Can use " per " as a synonym for "=>" in `fromString`


  0.3 (4-15-2014)
  ----------------

  - Added unit conversion to fromString using "x => y"
  - Made dimensionality printing nicer.
  - Added doctests and doc coverage tests.


  0.2 (4-6-2014)
  --------------

  - Can handle arithmetical expressions in fromString
  - Added support for user-defined definitions
  - Added check that definitions are the same for conversions


  0.1 (3-31-2014)
  ---------------

  - Full implementation of multiplicative dimensional quantities (no offsets yet
    for temperatures).
  - Support for conversions and monadic quantity computations.
  - Builtin expression parser.
  - Simple definitions file format, fully stocked with units.
  - Travis CI, HSpec units tests, and HLint check.

description: |-
  A library for creating and manipulating physical
  quantities, which are a numerical value
  associated with a unit of measurement. Included
  is an expression parser and a huge list of
  predefined quantities with which to parse
  strings into a Quantity datatype. Once created,
  a quantity can be converted to different units
  or queried for its dimensionality. A user can
  also operate on quantities arithmetically, and
  doing so uses automatic unit conversion and
  simplification.
