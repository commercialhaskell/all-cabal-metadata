  This package provides Haskell bindings to the
  the [POSIX network database (<netdb.h>) API](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009696699/basedefs/netdb.h.html).

  === Relationship to the @network@ package

  The @network@ package version 2.* series provides "Network.BSD" but
  it is removed starting with @network@ version 3.0.

  This package provides the "Network.BSD" module split off from the
  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/network network package>.

  If in addition to the @network@'s modules also "Network.BSD" is
  necessary, add @network-bsd@ to your dependencies like so:

  > library
  >     build-depends: network     >= 2.7 && < 3.1
  >                  , network-bsd >= 2.7 && < 2.9

  I.e. you can control the version of the @network@ package
  independently.

  __NOTE__: Starting with @network-bsd-2.8.1.0@ the APIs of @network@
  and @network-bsd@ evolve differently, and consequently the
  versioning doesn't match up anymore! Moreover, also starting with
  version @network-bsd-2.8.1.0@ this package requires @network >= 3@
  in order to avoid module name clashes with @network < 3@'s
  "Network.BSD" module.

  However, @network-bsd-2.7.0.0@ and @network-bsd-2.8.0.0@ passes thru
  the "Network.BSD" module from @network-2.7.*@ and @network-2.8.*@
  respectively in a non-clashing way via Cabal's
  <https://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/developing-packages.html#pkg-field-library-reexported-modules reexported-modules>
  feature while ensuring a well-defined
  <https://pvp.haskell.org/ API versioning> of the observable API of
  @network-bsd@. This is why the example above supporting a wide range
  of @network@ versions works by including version 2.7.0.0 in the
  required version range of @network-bsd@.
