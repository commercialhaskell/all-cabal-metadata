changelog: "0.3.2.5 - 01. December 2016\n  * Taking out the duplcate checking to mkSnmpBulkGet
  was a total mistake\n    snmpbulkget reads beyond the needed parts whereas bulkwalk
  stays within\n    the subtree of the requested OID. Thus snmpbulkget is actually
  returning\n    duplicate results which is ok. They will be filtered in the bulkWalk\n
  \   part\n    Will deprecate the 0.3.2.4 on hackage.\n\n0.3.2.4 - 14. November 2016\n
  \ * Throw an error on duplicate OIDs in the mkSnmpBulkGet response\n\n0.3.2.3 -
  14. November 2016\n  * Throw an error on duplicate OIDs in the bulkWalk response\n\n0.3.2.2
  - 26. April 2016\n  * Export snmpBulkWalkN to be able to control the amount of repetiotions\n
  \   in the SNMP BulkWalk Command. Courtesy of Kyle McKean\n    (https://github.com/mckeankylej)\n\n0.3.2.1
  - 11. April 2016\n  * Fix parsing IPs. Issue #4 (https://github.com/ptek/netsnmp/issues/4)\n\t
  \ In the prevois code, \"0.0.0.0\" converts to \"\\NUL.\\NUL.\\NUL.\\NUL\"\n\t  Thanks
  to lievenm (https://github.com/lievenm) for pointing it out.\n\t* Remove the dependency
  on utf8-string. Using ByteString.Char8 instead\n\t  since the oids we were decoding
  as utf8 before, are number after all\n\t  and should not be in UTF8 range anyway\n\n0.3.2.0
  - 19. June 2015\n        * Make the library compile with GHC 7.10.1\n\n0.3.1.0 -
  19. April 2014\n        * Make the library work on Debian 7 with ByteString 0.9\n\n0.3.0.6\n
  \       * OIDpart type is hacked to work correctly on OS X\n\n0.3.0.5\n        *
  Tied the OIDPart to the correct C Type of the oid.\n          NOTE: This breaks
  the code on the OS X and we don't know why\n                The oid of the SNMP
  Result can not be read correctly\n\n0.3.0.4\n        * Reduced the default number
  of max-repetitions in Bulk PDUs to 30.\n          The previous value caused oversized
  responses on Extreme Network\n          switches.\n\n0.3.0.3\n        * Fixed a
  bug, where instead of 32 bit, the OID part was set to CLong,\n          which became
  64 bit in base 4.5\n\n0.3.*\n        * Switch from Strings to ByteStrings\n\n0.2.*\n
  \       * Implementation includes snmpBulkWalk\n"

  Network.Protocol.NetSNMP is a partial binding to the
  library portion of the net-snmp package.  It uses the
  'single-session api', which is claimed to be
  thread-safe.  Not all operations are supported yet;
  please contact the maintainer if you're in need of
  expanded functionality, and especially if you would
  like to contribute.
