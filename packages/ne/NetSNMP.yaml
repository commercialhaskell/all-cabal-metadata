  0.4.0.0 - 26. March 2024
    * Add a MonadFail instance of Trouble. Thanks to @arthur-den
      (https://github.com/arthur-den) for contribution.
    * P.S. This package could use a new maintainer who is much more connected
      to the haskell community and ecosystem. Please reach out if you are
      interested.

  0.3.2.6 - ***
    * Switched to stack as the main building tool. Please raise an issue if
      you think that its inappropriate for a library.
    * Automate running tests using CircleCI

  0.3.2.5 - 01. December 2016
    * Taking out the loop checking to mkSnmpBulkGet was a total mistake.
      snmpbulkget reads beyond the needed parts whereas bulkwalk stays within
      the subtree of the requested OID. Thus snmpbulkget is actually returning
      duplicate results which is ok. Have reverted the change made in 0.3.2.4
      and the loops will now be checked in the snmpBulkWalkN after making sure
      that all the OIDs are from the requested subtree.
      Deprecates 0.3.2.4

  0.3.2.4 - 14. November 2016
    * Throw an error on duplicate OIDs in the mkSnmpBulkGet response

  0.3.2.3 - 14. November 2016
    * Throw an error on duplicate OIDs in the bulkWalk response

  0.3.2.2 - 26. April 2016
    * Export snmpBulkWalkN to be able to control the amount of repetiotions
      in the SNMP BulkWalk Command. Courtesy of Kyle McKean
      (https://github.com/mckeankylej)

  0.3.2.1 - 11. April 2016
    * Fix parsing IPs. Issue #4 (https://github.com/ptek/netsnmp/issues/4)
      In the prevois code, "0.0.0.0" converts to "\NUL.\NUL.\NUL.\NUL"
      Thanks to lievenm (https://github.com/lievenm) for pointing it out.
    * Remove the dependency on utf8-string. Using ByteString.Char8 instead
      since the oids we were decoding as utf8 before, are number after all
      and should not be in UTF8 range anyway

  0.3.2.0 - 19. June 2015
          * Make the library compile with GHC 7.10.1

  0.3.1.0 - 19. April 2014
          * Make the library work on Debian 7 with ByteString 0.9

  0.3.0.6
          * OIDpart type is hacked to work correctly on OS X

  0.3.0.5
          * Tied the OIDPart to the correct C Type of the oid.
            NOTE: This breaks the code on the OS X and we don't know why
                  The oid of the SNMP Result can not be read correctly

  0.3.0.4
          * Reduced the default number of max-repetitions in Bulk PDUs to 30.
            The previous value caused oversized responses on Extreme Network
            switches.

  0.3.0.3
          * Fixed a bug, where instead of 32 bit, the OID part was set to CLong,
            which became 64 bit in base 4.5

  0.3.*
          * Switch from Strings to ByteStrings

  0.2.*
          * Implementation includes snmpBulkWalk

description: |-
  Network.Protocol.NetSNMP is a partial binding to the
  library portion of the net-snmp package. It uses the
  'single-session api', which is claimed to be
  thread-safe.  Not all operations are supported yet;
  please contact the maintainer if you're in need of
  expanded functionality, and especially if you would
  like to contribute.
