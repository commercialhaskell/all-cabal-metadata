  network-info
  =============

  This library provides simple read-only access to the local computer's
  networking configuration. It is currently capable of getting a list of
  all the network interfaces and their respective IPv4, IPv6 and MAC
  addresses.

  Compatibility
  --------------

  network-info has been tested and is known to work on Ubuntu 10.10, Mac
  OS X 10.6.4, FreeBSD 9.0 and Windows XP/7. It probably works on other
  flavours of Linux, OS X, FreeBSD and Windows as well.
