description: "The code here is a fairly straightforward translation of the tutorial\nnested
  sampling code from Skilling and Sivia. The translation was\ndone by Issac Trotts
  starting in June 2011.\n\nWhat follows is an adaptation of the original README:\n\nThis
  directory holds little toy nested-sampling programs\nin Haskell, adapted from the
  C code in the update of Devinder's book \"Data\nAnalysis: a Bayesian Tutorial\"
  (2nd edition) OUP 2006.\n\nTo get started, install Haskell (GHC), then run\n$ cabal
  install\n\nTry out the example program like this:\n\n$ lighthouse \nlogZ: -160.48
  +- 0.17\ninformation: 2.90 nats\n1000 samples\n\nx = 1.25 +- 0.18\ny = 1.00 +- 0.20\n\nDetails
  can be found at the top of lighthouse.hs.\n\n"
