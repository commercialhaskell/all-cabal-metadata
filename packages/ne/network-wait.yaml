  # Changelog for network-wait

  ## 0.1.2

  - Compatibility with GHC 8.2 and Stack LTS 11

  ## 0.1.1

  - Add `Network.Wait.PostgreSQL` module with functions to wait for PostgreSQL servers to become ready to accept connections. This module and its dependency on `postgresql-simple` are not enabled by default. The `network-wait:postgres` flag must be enabled for this package's PostgreSQL support.

  ## 0.1.0

  - First release
basic-deps:
  exceptions: -any

  # network-wait

  A lightweight Haskell library for waiting on networked services to become available. This is useful if you are e.g. building a web application which relies on a database server to be available, but which may not be immediately available on application startup.

  ## Example

  All functions provided by this library work with retry policies from [`Control.Retry`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/retry) which provide good control over the retry behaviour. To wait for a PostgreSQL server to become available on the same machine:

  ```haskell
  import Control.Retry
  import Network.Wait

  main :: IO ()
  main = do
      waitTcp retryPolicyDefault "localhost" "5432"
      putStrLn "Yay, the server is available!"
  ```

  The haddock documentation for this library contains more examples.

  ## Example: PostgreSQL

  The `network-wait` package can be compiled with the `network-wait:postgres` flag (e.g. `stack build --flag network-wait:postgres`) which enables support for checking the readiness of PostgreSQL servers specifically. Unlike the functions in the `Network.Wait` module, which only check that connections can be established, the functions in `Network.Wait.PostgreSQL` also check that a PostgreSQL server is ready to accept commands. To wait for a PostgreSQL server to become available and accept commands:

  ```haskell
  import Control.Retry (retryPolicyDefault)
  import Database.PostgreSQL.Simple (defaultConnectInfo)
  import Network.Wait.PostgreSQL (waitPostgreSQL)

  main :: IO ()
  main = do
      waitPostgreSQL retryPolicyDefault defaultConnectInfo
      putStrLn "Yay, the PostgreSQL server is ready to accept commands!"
  ```

  Internally, this uses `postgresql-simple` to connect to the specified server (`defaultConnectInfo` in the example above) and send a `SELECT 1;` query. If the query is answered correctly, we consider the server to be in a state ready to accept commands.

  The `Network.Wait.PostgreSQL` module is gated behind the `network-wait:postgres` flag so that the PostgreSQL-specific dependencies are only required when PostgresSQL support is required by users of this library.
