  This package provides @NonEmpty@, an alternative to the NonEmpty type
  in base.

  It has a few differences from base's NonEmpty:

  * It has @Show@ and @Read@ instance similar to that of normal lists
  * It has a 100% safe API
  * It has a few added\/removed\/updated functions (see @Data.List.NeoNonEmpty@'s module docs)
  * New functions aren't tied to new versions of GHC/base

  The show instance is the original raison d'Ãªtre. When scanning textual data,
  the brain can interpret uniformity more quickly. Which do you think is easier
  to scan?

  > x :| [y, z]
  > [x, y, z]

  Now imagine this in various fields of a large compound structure, and you
  have two of them, and you're trying to find the difference.

  >>> aNonEmpty [1, 2, 3]
  [1,2,3]
  >>> read "[1, 2, 3]" :: NonEmpty Int
  [1,2,3]
