description: |-
  net-concurrent is a simple haskell library for doing parallel
  computation on several computers using the network. There is a
  single master process and many slave processes. Communication
  is between the master and the slaves, for simplicity slaves
  never communicate with each other.
  Communication is done using NVars, network variables.
  The NVar api is very similar to MVar. These are stored in the
  master process and shared between all processes in the system.
  Slave nodes can read and write these NVar variables which results
  in network transactions with the master.
