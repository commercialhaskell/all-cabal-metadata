changelog: ! "# Version 0.4.0.5\n\n* Bump upper bound on `transformers` dependency.\n\n\n#
  Version 0.4.0.4\n\n* Bump upper bound on `exceptions` dependency.\n\n\n# Version
  0.4.0.3\n\n* Bump upper bound on `exceptions` dependency.\n\n\n# Version 0.4.0.2\n\n*
  Workaround `sendLazy` build issues in Windows 8 (see #13).\n\n* Bump upper bound
  on `network` dependency.\n\n\n# Version 0.4.0.1\n\n* Add `sendLazy` and `sendMany`
  to `Network.Simple.TCP`.\n\n\n# Version 0.4\n\n* Bump lower and upper bounds `exceptions`
  dependency. Replacing some\n  uses of `MonadCatch` with `MonadMask.\n\n* Bump upper
  bound on `network` dependency.\n\n* Bump upper bound on `transformers` dependency.\n\n\n#
  Version 0.3.1\n\n* Bumped upper-bounds on `exceptions` dependency.\n\n\n# Version
  0.3.0\n\n* Re-export `Network.Socket.close` at `Network.Simple.TCP`, except\n  called
  `closeSock`.\n\n* Re-export `Socket`, `SockAddr`, `HostName` and `ServiceName` from\n
  \ `Network.Socket` at `Network.Simple.TCP`.\n\n* Generalize the `IO` monad by using
  `MonadIO` and `MonadCatch` (from\n  the `exceptions` library).\n\n\n# Version 0.2.1.0\n\n*
  Export `send` and `recv` from `Network.Simple.TCP`.\n\n* Re-export `Network.Socket.withSocketsDo`
  from `Network.Simple.TCP`.\n\n\n# Version 0.2.0.1\n\n* FIX: `acceptFork` now properly
  closes the connection socket, even in\n  case of asynchronous exceptions.\n\n\n#
  Version 0.2.0.0\n\n* `Network.Simple.TCP.serveFork` was renamed to `serve`, and
  the previous\n  function named `serve` was removed.\n\n\n# Version 0.1.0.1\n\n*
  Fixed typos, including the maintainer email.\n\n\n# Version 0.1.0.0\n\n* First release.\n"

  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/k0001/network-simple.png)](http://travis-ci.org/k0001/network-simple)


  Haskell library abstracting over simple network sockets usage patterns.

  Currently, only TCP sockets are supported. Support for UDP and Unix

  sockets is planned for future versions.
