  # `network-simple-sockaddr`

  [network-simple](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/network-simple-0.3.0 network-simple)
  works by resolving `HostName`s. This packages offers a similar API but
  working with unresolved addresses in the form of `SockAddr`es. In addition to
  `IPv4` addresses, `IPv6` and `Unix Domain Sockets` are also supported.
