description: |-
  The network package provides getSocketOption and setSocketOption functions.
  These work fine for socket options represented using the @int@ type
  (namely, all boolean options, and a few quantity options).  However, it
  doesn't work for, say, @SO_LINGER@, @SO_RCVTIMEO@, and @SO_SNDTIMEO@, as
  these use different, platform-specific representations.

  This package implements the getters and setters as separate functions.  At
  the moment, it only provides socket options that are available for both
  Unix and Windows.

  This package also provides a workaround needed to time out network
  operations in Windows without leaking resources.
