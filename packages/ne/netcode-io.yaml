  # netcode-io [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Mokosha/netcode-io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Mokosha/netcode-io)
  Haskell bindings to the
  [netcode.io](https://github.com/networkprotocol/netcode.io) library

  ## Development

  These bindings were developed using `stack` in the "usual" way. We expect
  that anyone building from source to use the same workflow. The only major
  dependency is on the `sodium` library. `netcode-io` uses at least version
  `1.0.16`. Below are various ways for integrating this into your Haskell
  build ecosystem.

  ### Windows

  The cabal file specifies that the `sodium` library is required for building
  this package. Unfortunately, this is a bit tricky on Windows since there's no
  native package manager. To use this with Windows, we recommend using
  [`MSYS2`](https://www.msys2.org/). `msys2.exe` has a built-in shell for using
  the `gcc` toolchain on Windows. This toolchain is compatible with the one `ghc`
  uses. Within this environment, you can install `sodium` using the `pacman`
  package manager:

  ```
  $ pacman -S mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-libsodium
  ```

  Once installed, you can add the following lines to your global `config.yaml`:

  ```
  extra-include-dirs:
    - D:\msys64\mingw64\include

  extra-lib-dirs:
    - D:\msys64\mingw64\lib
  ```

  Your `config.yaml` is located at your `%STACK_ROOT%` directory:

  ```
  C:\> stack path --stack-root
  C:\path\to\stack\root
  ```

  ### OS X

  On MacOS, we can install `sodium` simply by using homebrew:

  ```
  $ brew install libsodium
  ```

  ### Linux

  On Linux, it depends on your package manager, but if you're using Ubuntu Bionic (18.04) or later:

  ```
  $ sudo apt-get install libsodium-dev
  ```

  ## LICENSING

  IANAL, but these bindings use
  [the same license](https://github.com/networkprotocol/netcode.io/blob/master/LICENCE)
  that the original library uses, so you must comply with both.
