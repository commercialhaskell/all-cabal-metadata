  @network-packet-linux@ makes it possible to use
  the [network package](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/network)
  with Linux packet sockets. Packet sockets are described
  in [packet (7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/packet.7.html).

  === Usage
  Combine functions from "Network.Socket.Address" with types from "Network.Socket.Linux" in order to
  work with packet sockets.

  See the "Network.Socket.Linux" module documentation or @examples/ListenToInterface.hs@ for an example.

  === About the package
  As of version 3.0.0, the @network@ package provides a socket API that is
  implemented in terms of the 'SocketAddress' typeclass.
  @network-packet-linux@ provides 'SockAddrLl', a 'SocketAddress' instance
  that corresponds to the @sockaddr_ll@ struct from @\<linux/if_packet.h\>@.

  Additionally, @network-packet-linux@ provides some convenience types:
  'ProtocolId' (an enumeration of the Ethernet protocol IDs defined in
  @\<linux/if_ether.h\>@) and 'PacketType' (enumerating the packet types
  defined in @\<linux/if_packet.h\>@).

  __Hackage note__: The false dependency on `vendored-network` is an annoying
  side effect of the way we pull in `network` files. Ideally the dependency
  on `network` files should be an internal cabal library, but internal
  libraries aren't supported for the build style we need.
