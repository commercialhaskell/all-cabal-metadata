  # Version 0.4

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE: `ClientSettings` and `ServerSettings` are
    gone.  Instead, `ClientParams` and `ServerParams` from the `tls` package are
    now used throughout.

    The related functions `updateClientParams`, `clientParams`,
    `updateServerParams`, `serverParams` are gone.

    `makeClientSettings` was renamed to `makeClientParams`, which returns
    `ClientParams` and takes `[Credential]` rather than `Credentials`.

    `makeServerSettings` was renamed to `makeServerParams`, which returns
    `ServerParams`.

    `getDefaultClientSettings` was replaced by `newDefaultClientParams`, which adds
    an in-memory `SessionManager` to the `ClientParams`.

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE: `Credentials` from `Network.TLS` is not
    re-exported anymore.

  * Added `newDefaultServerParams`, which creates a `ServerParams` with an
    in-memory `SessionManager`.

  * Re-export `ServerParams`, `ClientParams` from `Network.TLS`.

  * Export `credentialLoadX509`, which is the same as
    `Network.TLS.credentialLoadX509` but runs in `MonadIO`.

  * Support TLS 1.3, TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.1 by default.

  * Bump version dependency on `tls` to `>= 1.5`.

  * Add dependency on `tls-session-manager`.


  # Version 0.3.2

  * Added `sendLazy`.

  * Fixed space leak on `recv`. See issue #13.


  # Version 0.3.1

  * Added SOCKS5 proxy support. See functions `connectOverSOCKS5` and
    `connectTlsOverSOCKS5`.

  * Use `safe-exceptions`.


  # Version 0.3

  * BREAKING CHANGE: Changed type of the following functions:
    `getDefaultClientSettings`, `makeClientSettings`, `updateClientParams`,
    `clientParams`, `makeServerSettings`, `updateServerParams`, `serverParams`.

  * BREAKING CHANGE: Only TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 are supported by default.

  * Server's choice of ciphers are always prefered over client's.

  * Server code will mandate strong cipher requirements, client code will be more
    permissive.

  * Compatible with `tls-1.4`

  * Remove upper bounds for all dependencies except `base`.


  # Version 0.2.1

  * Ensure that the Socket TLS backend always receive the expected number
    of bytes. This issue showed up as the following exception previously:

        Error_Packet "partial packet: expecting 100 bytes, got: 6"


  # Version 0.2.0

  * Re-export `Socket`, `SockAddr`, `HostName` and `ServiceName` from
    `Network.Socket` at `Network.Simple.TCP.TLS`.

  * Re-export `Context` from `Network.TLS` at `Network.Simple.TCP.TLS`.

  * Generalize the `IO` monad by using `MonadIO` and `MonadCatch` (from
    the `exceptions` library).

  * Added `makeClientContext`, `makeServerContext` and `useTlsThenClose`.

  * Use `Socket` as a TLS backend instead of `Handle`.

  * Drop dependency on `monad-random-api` in favour of `monad-random`.

  * Dependency bumps.


  # Version 0.1.1.0

  * Export 'Network.Socket.withSocketsDo' from 'Network.Simple.TCP.TLS'.


  # Version 0.1.0.1

  * Dependency bumps.


  # Version 0.1.0.0

  * First release.

  # network-simple-tls

  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/k0001/network-simple-tls.png)](http://travis-ci.org/k0001/network-simple-tls)

  Haskell library simplifying the useage of TLS secured network
  connections. Currently, only TCP sockets are supported. This package
  aims to be similar and compatible with the `network-simple` package.
