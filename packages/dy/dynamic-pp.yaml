description: |-
  This library provides pretty-print operators similar to the set provided by the Wadler-Leijin pretty-printer.
  The main difference, however, is that it utilizes a dynamic programming algorithm for rendering.  This slightly
  reduces the available combinators, but provides a layout engine that optimizes documents, minimizing their
  over-wrap and line count.

  The dynamic programming algorithm has pathological cases that cause it to run in quadratic time; however,
  typical use on code-like programs should see better run times.  In general, documents with many uses of the
  choose combinator will require more time to render.

  This library also provides two simpler rendering engines for uses where the full optimal layout engine is not
  necessary.  These engines are much simpler and consume fewer resources.

  NOTE: This library is still in development.  It may contain bugs, performance issues, and the interface may change.
