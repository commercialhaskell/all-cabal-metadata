  # DynamoDB layer for Haskell

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ondrap/dynamodb-simple.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ondrap/dynamodb-simple) [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/dynamodb-simple.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dynamodb-simple)

  This library intends to simplify working with DynamoDB AWS database.
  It uses Generics code ([generics-sop](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generics-sop)) on top of your structures
  and just by adding a few instances allows you to easily generate AWS
  commands.

  ````haskell
  data Test = Test {
      category :: T.Text
    , user     :: T.Text
    , subject  :: T.Text
    , replies  :: Int
  } deriving (Show)
  -- Generate instances and category', user' etc. variables for queries/updates
  mkTableDefs "migrate" (tableConfig "" (''Test, WithRange) [] [])

  test :: IO ()
  test = do
    lgr  <- newLogger Info stdout
    setEnv "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    setEnv "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXfdjdsfjdsfjdskldfs+kl"
    env  <- newEnv Discover
    let dynamo = setEndpoint False "localhost" 8000 dynamoDB
    let newenv = env & configure dynamo & set envLogger lgr
    runResourceT $ runAWS newenv $ do
        migrate mempty Nothing -- Create tables, indices etc.
        --
        putItem (Test "news" "john" "test" 20)
        --
        item <- getItem Eventually tTest ("news", "john")
        liftIO $ print item
        --
        items <- scanCond tTest (replies' >. 15) 10
        liftIO $ print items
  ````
  ### Features

  - Global secondary indexes.
  - Local secondary indexes.
  - Tables with only hash keys as well as tables with combined hash and sort key.
  - Sparse indexes (define the column as `Maybe` in a table, omit the `Maybe` in index definition).
  - Automatically generate polymorphic lenses to access fields in main table and index records.
  - Standard datatypes including `Tagged` and basic default instances for data types supporting
    `Show/Read`.
  - New types can be added easily.
  - High-level, easy-to-use API - hides intricacies of both DynamoDB and amazonka library.
  - Type-safe conditions, including nested structures.
  - Type-safe update actions.
  - Template-haskell macro to easily create all relevant instances.
  - 'Schema migration' - upon startup checks if the database schema matches the definition
    and, if possible, adjusts the database. If it is impossible, it fails.
  - Automatic handling of invalid values (empty strings, empty sets). Automatic rewriting of
    queries when searching for these empty values.
  - Compatible with GHC8 `DuplicateRecordFields`
  - Customizable table and index names. Custom translation of field names to attribute names.
  - AWS Dynamo streaming settings.
  - Utilities to help with simulated joins or retriving original data from index.
  - Both conduit and page-based API.

  ### What is planned

  - Support for automatic versioning of fields.

  ### Limitations

  - Projections are not supported. Using some generic programming on tuples it should be possible.
  - You cannot compare attributes between themselves (i.e. `currentAccount' >=. averageAccount'`).
    I'm not sure this would be currently technically possible. Does anybody need it?

  ### Handling of NULLs

  DynamoDB does not accept empty strings/sets. It accepts `NULL`, but that is not acceptable
  in fields that are used for sparse indexing.

  Empty string and empty set are represented by omitting the value.

  * `Just Nothing :: Maybe (Maybe a)` will become `Nothing` on retrieval.
  * `[Just 1, Nothing, Just 3]` will become `[Just 1, Just 3]` on retrieval.
  * `HashMap Text (Maybe a)` is not a good idea; missing values will disappear.
  * `Maybe (Set a)` will become `Nothing` on empty set
  * Don't try to use inequality comparisons (`>.`, `<.`) on empty strings.
  * If you use `maybeCol' == Nothing`, it gets internally replaced
    by `attr_missing(maybeCol)`, so it will behave as expected. The same with
    empty `String` or `Set`. Keep that in mind when traversing nested structures.
  * In case of schema change, `Maybe` columns are considered `Nothing`.
  * In case of schema change, `String` columns are decoded as empty strings, `Set` columns
    as empty sets, `[a]` columns as empty lists.
  * Condition for `== ""`, `== []` etc. is automatically enhanced to account for non-existent attributes
    (i.e. after schema change).
  * Empty list/empty hashmap is represented as empty list/hashmap; however it is allowed to be decoded
    even when the attribute is missing in order to allow better schema migrations.
