description: |-
  Haskell excels at handling data like continuous functions
  in a nice way, i.e. without discretising anything to finite arrays as
  is typically done in languages like Matlab. Instead, you can simply pass
  around functions or infinite data structures (or /very/ high-resolution data
  that would be infeasible to handle in a strict language).

  However when you want to /view/ the data, it will eventually need to be exported out of Haskell
  in some finite form. The purpose of this library is to delay this discretisation
  as long as possible: it implements an interactive plotting window that accepts continuous/recursive
  data and only &#x201c;flattens&#x201d; it according to the specific view configuration.
  You can then zoom in to a shown diagram and it will automatically calculate
  the features more detailedly, or zoom out and discover previosly unexpected
  features. You don't need to worry about specifying the range and/or resolution beforehand:
  the program will try to find a suitable default view based on /all/ data your displaying,
  and you can always still zoom, resize or move later.

  <http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams> are used as the &#x201c;pre-rendered&#x201d; type. This
  makes the output usable in a very wide range of applications, though at the moment only the GTK
  window view is implemented.
