description: ! 'Haskell excels at handling data like continuous functions

  in a nice way, i.e. without discretising anything to finite arrays as

  is typically done in languages like Matlab. Instead, you can simply pass

  around functions or infinite data structures (or /very/ high-resolution data

  that would be infeasible to handle in a strict language).


  However when you want to /view/ the data, it will eventually need to be exported
  out of Haskell

  in some finite form. The purpose of this library is to delay this discretisation

  as long as possible: it implements an interactive plotting window that accepts continuous/recursive

  data and only &#x201c;flattens&#x201d; it according to the specific view configuration.

  You can then zoom in to a shown diagram and it will automatically calculate

  the features more detailedly, or zoom out and discover previosly unexpected

  features. You don''t need to worry about specifying the range and/or resolution
  beforehand:

  the program will try to find a suitable default view based on /all/ data your displaying,

  and you can always still zoom, resize or move later.


  <http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams> are used as the &#x201c;pre-rendered&#x201d;
  type. This

  makes the output usable in a very wide range of applications, though at the moment
  only the GTK

  window view is implemented.'
