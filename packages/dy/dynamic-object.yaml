description: |-
  This package aims to combine the merit of Haskell's open, strong type system
  with flexible Object-oriented programming
  found in dynamically-typed languages such as
  python or ruby.

  @Object@s are implemented as @Map@s from method keys
  to values. Each key specifies its own value types.
  You can add new members at runtime, for any instances of the object (singleton class).
  At the same time, you have typed and runtime-error-free access to the members (duck typing).

  See @Data.Object.Dynamic.Examples.PointParticle@ for examples.
