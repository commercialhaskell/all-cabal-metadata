description: |-
  Data.NibbleString holds an array of Nibbles (4-bit values), and provides an interface similar to that in Data.ByteString.
  Although similar to Bytestring, there are obvious differences.  The "length" of a nibblestring will be twice that of bytestring,
  unpacking a nibblestring will result in two items per byte, etc.
  Data.NibbleString is intended to be imported qualified.
