description: "# `nix-diff`\n\nThis package provides a `nix-diff` executable which
  explains why two Nix\nderivations differ.  The most common use cases for this are:\n\n*
  Understanding why you have a cache miss\n* Verifying a Nix change had the intended
  effect at the derivation level\n* Improving your understanding of how Nix works\n\nFor
  example, consider the following Nix derivation to build a bare-bones NixOS\nsystem:\n\n```nix\nlet\n
  \ nixos = import <nixpkgs/nixos> {\n    system = \"x86_64-linux\";\n\n    configuration
  = {\n      boot.loader.grub.devices = [ \"/dev/sda\" ];\n\n      fileSystems.\"/\"
  = {\n        device = \"/dev/sda\";\n      };\n    };\n  };\n\nin\n  nixos.system\n```\n\nWe
  can use `nix-instantiate` to compute the derivation for the above file:\n\n```bash\n$
  nix-instantiate example.nix  # Your exact hash might differ\nwarning: you did not
  specify ‘--add-root’; the result might be removed by the garbage collector\n/nix/store/6z9nr5pzs4j1v9mld517dmlcz61zy78z-nixos-system-nixos-18.03pre119245.5cfd049a03.drv\n```\n\nNow,
  let's add a service to our system definition:\n\n```nix\nlet\n  nixos = import <nixpkgs/nixos>
  {\n    system = \"x86_64-linux\";\n\n    configuration = {\n      boot.loader.grub.devices
  = [ \"/dev/sda\" ];\n\n      fileSystems.\"/\" = {\n        device = \"/dev/sda\";\n
  \     };\n\n      services.apache-kafka.enable = true;\n    };\n  };\n\nin\n  nixos.system\n```\n\n...
  and compute the derivation for the updated system:\n\n```bash\n$ nix-instantiate
  example.nix\nwarning: you did not specify ‘--add-root’; the result might be removed
  by the garbage collector\n/nix/store/k05ibijg0kknvwrgfyb7dxwjrs8qrlbj-nixos-system-nixos-18.03pre119245.5cfd049a03.drv\n```\n\nWe
  can use `nix-diff` to compare the two computed derivations to determine what\nchanged
  about our system:\n\n```bash\n$ nix-diff /nix/store/6z9nr5pzs4j1v9mld517dmlcz61zy78z-nixos-system-nixos-18.03pre119245.5cfd049a03.drv
  /nix/store/k05ibijg0kknvwrgfyb7dxwjrs8qrlbj-nixos-system-nixos-18.03pre119245.5cfd049a03.drv
  \n```\n\n... which produces the following output:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KUB4rXx.png)\n\n##
  Development status\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Gabriel439/nix-diff.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Gabriel439/nix-diff)\n\nI
  don't currently plan to add any new features, but I do welcome feature\nrequests.
  \ Just open an issue on the issue tracker if you would like to request\nan improvement.\n\n##
