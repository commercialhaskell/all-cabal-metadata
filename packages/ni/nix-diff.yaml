changelog: |
  1.0.20

  * [Add `--context` flag](https://github.com/Gabriella439/nix-diff/pull/81)
    * This limits the context to the specified number of characters/words/lines
  * [Bump upper bounds](https://github.com/Gabriella439/nix-diff/pull/79)
    * Allow `unix-2.8` and few more

  1.0.19

  * [New Haskell API](https://github.com/Gabriella439/nix-diff/pull/60)
    * Previously `nix-diff` only had a command-line API, but now there is a
      Haskell API available under the `Nix.Diff` module hierarchy
  * [Machine-readable output](https://github.com/Gabriella439/nix-diff/pull/61)
    * `nix-diff` now supports a `--json` flag for machine-readable JSON output
  * [New `--skip-already-compared` command-line option](https://github.com/Gabriella439/nix-diff/pull/69)
    * This compresses a sub-tree of the diff if the leaves have already been
      compared
  * [New `--squash-text-diff` command-line option](https://github.com/Gabriella439/nix-diff/pull/70)
    * This compresses textual diffs into larger spans when possible
  * [Ignore `!${OUTPUT}`](https://github.com/Gabriella439/nix-diff/pull/66)
    * `nix-diff` will now strip everything after `!` from a derivation argument
      so that arguments like `/nix/store/…!bin` no longer fail

  1.0.18

  * [Document the `--color` command-line option](https://github.com/Gabriel439/nix-diff/pull/54)

  1.0.17

  * [Handle `.drv` and `.nix` files that contain non-UTF8 text](https://github.com/Gabriel439/nix-diff/pull/50)

  1.0.16

  * [Accept realised store paths as input](https://github.com/Gabriel439/nix-diff/pull/47)
    * `nix-diff` will attempt to find the corresponding derivations using
      `nix-store --query --deriver` if you provide a realised store path as input

  1.0.15

  * [Fix non-exhaustive pattern match](https://github.com/Gabriel439/nix-diff/pull/45)
      * This non-exhaustive pattern match would cause the program to fail if
        the new derivation added or removed input sources

  1.0.14

  * [Improve whitespace handling](https://github.com/Gabriel439/nix-diff/pull/40)
      * `--word-oriented` now treats all whitespace characters as word
        boundaries instead of just spaces

        This matches the behavior of `Prelude.words`

      * `--word-oriented` no longer highlights the intervening spaces between
        words

        This is for consistency with `--line-oriented`, which doesn't
        highlight the intervening spaces between lines.  Also, you could argue
        that if the user specifies `--word-oriented` then they want all new
        tokens to be highlighted on a word-by-word basis.

      * `--line-oriented` now no longer introduces a trailing newline at the
        end of a newline-free segment of text

      * More generally, both `--word-oriented` and `--newline-oriented`
        exactly preserve the original whitespace that was used for word or
        line boundaries.

  1.0.13

  * [Add new `--word-oriented` mode, which is now the new default mode](https://github.com/Gabriel439/nix-diff/pull/38)
      * This now diffs on word boundaries instead of line-boundaries

  1.0.12

  * [Use "patience" diff algorithm](https://github.com/Gabriel439/nix-diff/pull/33)
      * This improves the quality of the diff

  1.0.11

  * [Add support for diffing input sources](https://github.com/Gabriel439/nix-diff/pull/30)

  # `nix-diff`

  [![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/Gabriella439/nix-diff/ci.yaml?branch=main)](https://github.com/Gabriella439/nix-diff/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)
  [![Hackage version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/nix-diff.svg?color=success)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nix-diff)

  This package provides a `nix-diff` executable which explains why two Nix
  derivations differ.  The most common use cases for this are:

  * Understanding why you have a cache miss
  * Verifying a Nix change had the intended effect at the derivation level
  * Improving your understanding of how Nix works

  For example, consider the following Nix derivation to build a bare-bones NixOS
  system:

  ```nix
  let
    nixos = import <nixpkgs/nixos> {
      system = "x86_64-linux";

      configuration = {
        boot.loader.grub.devices = [ "/dev/sda" ];

        fileSystems."/" = {
          device = "/dev/sda";
        };
      };
    };

  in
    nixos.system
  ```

  We can use `nix-instantiate` to compute the derivation for the above file:

  ```bash
  $ nix-instantiate example.nix  # Your exact hash might differ
  warning: you did not specify ‘--add-root’; the result might be removed by the garbage collector
  /nix/store/6z9nr5pzs4j1v9mld517dmlcz61zy78z-nixos-system-nixos-18.03pre119245.5cfd049a03.drv
  ```

  Now, let's add a service to our system definition:

  ```nix
  let
    nixos = import <nixpkgs/nixos> {
      system = "x86_64-linux";

      configuration = {
        boot.loader.grub.devices = [ "/dev/sda" ];

        fileSystems."/" = {
          device = "/dev/sda";
        };

        services.apache-kafka.enable = true;
      };
    };

  in
    nixos.system
  ```

  ... and compute the derivation for the updated system:

  ```bash
  $ nix-instantiate example.nix
  warning: you did not specify ‘--add-root’; the result might be removed by the garbage collector
  /nix/store/k05ibijg0kknvwrgfyb7dxwjrs8qrlbj-nixos-system-nixos-18.03pre119245.5cfd049a03.drv
  ```

  We can use `nix-diff` to compare the two computed derivations to determine what
  changed about our system:

  ```bash
  $ nix-diff /nix/store/6z9nr5pzs4j1v9mld517dmlcz61zy78z-nixos-system-nixos-18.03pre119245.5cfd049a03.drv /nix/store/k05ibijg0kknvwrgfyb7dxwjrs8qrlbj-nixos-system-nixos-18.03pre119245.5cfd049a03.drv
  ```

  ... which produces the following output:

  It's also possible to pass store paths or links to store paths, for example:

  ```ShellSession
  $ nix-build example.nix
  $ nix-diff /run/current-system ./result
  ```
  ## Testing

  Run tests, using `cabal test` command.

  You need to have nix installed in your PC.

  ## Development status

  I don't currently plan to add any new features, but I do welcome feature
  requests.  Just open an issue on the issue tracker if you would like to request
  an improvement.
