synopsis: Explain why two Nix derivations differ
changelog: |
  1.0.17

  * [Handle `.drv` and `.nix` files that contain non-UTF8 text](https://github.com/Gabriel439/nix-diff/pull/50)

  1.0.16

  * [Accept realised store paths as input](https://github.com/Gabriel439/nix-diff/pull/47)
    * `nix-diff` will attempt to find the corresponding derivations using
      `nix-store --query --deriver` if you provide a realised store path as input

  1.0.15

  * [Fix non-exhaustive pattern match](https://github.com/Gabriel439/nix-diff/pull/45)
      * This non-exhaustive pattern match would cause the program to fail if
        the new derivation added or removed input sources

  1.0.14

  * [Improve whitespace handling](https://github.com/Gabriel439/nix-diff/pull/40)
      * `--word-oriented` now treats all whitespace characters as word
        boundaries instead of just spaces

        This matches the behavior of `Prelude.words`

      * `--word-oriented` no longer highlights the intervening spaces between
        words

        This is for consistency with `--line-oriented`, which doesn't
        highlight the intervening spaces between lines.  Also, you could argue
        that if the user specifies `--word-oriented` then they want all new
        tokens to be highlighted on a word-by-word basis.

      * `--line-oriented` now no longer introduces a trailing newline at the
        end of a newline-free segment of text

      * More generally, both `--word-oriented` and `--newline-oriented`
        exactly preserve the original whitespace that was used for word or
        line boundaries.

  1.0.13

  * [Add new `--word-oriented` mode, which is now the new default mode](https://github.com/Gabriel439/nix-diff/pull/38)
      * This now diffs on word boundaries instead of line-boundaries

  1.0.12

  * [Use "patience" diff algorithm](https://github.com/Gabriel439/nix-diff/pull/33)
      * This improves the quality of the diff

  1.0.11

  * [Add support for diffing input sources](https://github.com/Gabriel439/nix-diff/pull/30)

description: "# `nix-diff`\n\nThis package provides a `nix-diff` executable which
  explains why two Nix\nderivations differ.  The most common use cases for this are:\n\n*
  Understanding why you have a cache miss\n* Verifying a Nix change had the intended
  effect at the derivation level\n* Improving your understanding of how Nix works\n\nFor
  example, consider the following Nix derivation to build a bare-bones NixOS\nsystem:\n\n```nix\nlet\n
  \ nixos = import <nixpkgs/nixos> {\n    system = \"x86_64-linux\";\n\n    configuration
  = {\n      boot.loader.grub.devices = [ \"/dev/sda\" ];\n\n      fileSystems.\"/\"
  = {\n        device = \"/dev/sda\";\n      };\n    };\n  };\n\nin\n  nixos.system\n```\n\nWe
  can use `nix-instantiate` to compute the derivation for the above file:\n\n```bash\n$
  nix-instantiate example.nix  # Your exact hash might differ\nwarning: you did not
  specify ‘--add-root’; the result might be removed by the garbage collector\n/nix/store/6z9nr5pzs4j1v9mld517dmlcz61zy78z-nixos-system-nixos-18.03pre119245.5cfd049a03.drv\n```\n\nNow,
  let's add a service to our system definition:\n\n```nix\nlet\n  nixos = import <nixpkgs/nixos>
  {\n    system = \"x86_64-linux\";\n\n    configuration = {\n      boot.loader.grub.devices
  = [ \"/dev/sda\" ];\n\n      fileSystems.\"/\" = {\n        device = \"/dev/sda\";\n
  \     };\n\n      services.apache-kafka.enable = true;\n    };\n  };\n\nin\n  nixos.system\n```\n\n...
  and compute the derivation for the updated system:\n\n```bash\n$ nix-instantiate
  example.nix\nwarning: you did not specify ‘--add-root’; the result might be removed
  by the garbage collector\n/nix/store/k05ibijg0kknvwrgfyb7dxwjrs8qrlbj-nixos-system-nixos-18.03pre119245.5cfd049a03.drv\n```\n\nWe
  can use `nix-diff` to compare the two computed derivations to determine what\nchanged
  about our system:\n\n```bash\n$ nix-diff /nix/store/6z9nr5pzs4j1v9mld517dmlcz61zy78z-nixos-system-nixos-18.03pre119245.5cfd049a03.drv
  /nix/store/k05ibijg0kknvwrgfyb7dxwjrs8qrlbj-nixos-system-nixos-18.03pre119245.5cfd049a03.drv
  \n```\n\n... which produces the following output:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KUB4rXx.png)\n\nIt's
  also possible to pass store paths or links to store paths, for example:\n\n```ShellSession\n$
  nix-build example.nix\n$ nix-diff /run/current-system ./result\n```\n\n## Development
  status\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Gabriel439/nix-diff.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Gabriel439/nix-diff)\n\nI
  don't currently plan to add any new features, but I do welcome feature\nrequests.
  \ Just open an issue on the issue tracker if you would like to request\nan improvement.\n\n##
