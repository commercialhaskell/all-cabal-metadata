  # Revision history for nix-thunk

  ## 0.7.2.1
  * Loosen version bounds
  * Fix issue where thunk branches aren't updated when the user specifies --branch on nix-thunk update
  * Swap default.nix and lib.nix

  ## 0.7.2.0
  * Support retrieving revs that aren't on the default branch when a branch isn't specified.  To use this functionality, update your thunks.

  ## 0.7.1.0
  * Allow specifying `--rev` when doing `update` to update to a specific revision.

  ## 0.7.0.1

  * Support GHC 9.6

  ## 0.7.0.0

  * Caching now works
  * [#42](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/nix-thunk/pull/42) Thunk read errors are now presented in a more informative manner.
  * [#43](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/nix-thunk/pull/43) `nix-thunk` will now ensure that any `git` processes invoked during its execution have a clean configuration.
    This prevents `nix-thunk` crashing when e.g. the user's configuration `git` is valid only in a version newer than what `nix-thunk` links against, and works towards making thunks more reproducible by ensuring that thunk URIs are resolvable independently of the user's environment.

  ## 0.6.1.0

  * [#36](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/nix-thunk/pull/36) Expose the internals of the `nix-thunk` library.

  ## 0.6.0.0

  * [#34](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/nix-thunk/pull/34) Fix an
    issue where thunks could not be fetched without `nix-thunk` (or one of
    its dependents, e.g. `obelisk`) being installed. Please update all
    your thunks to use the new v8 thunk spec.

    Updating your thunk can be done by running `nix-thunk unpack $path; nix-thunk pack $path`.

  * [#35](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/nix-thunk/pull/35) Determine remote using git-config when `branch.<name>.merge` option is set
    (Fixes [obelisk#792](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/obelisk/issues/792).)

  ## 0.5.1.0

  * Bump to cli-nix 0.2.0.0; This ensures that `nix-prefetch-git` can always be found.

  ## 0.5.0.0

  * Fix a critical bug where v6 thunks can not be used to fetch non-GitHub repositories. Please update all your thunks to use the new v7 thunk spec.
    Updating your thunk can be done by running `nix-thunk unpack $path; nix-thunk pack $path`.
  * Building a functional `nix-thunk` _must_ be done using the included Nix derivation.

  ## 0.4.0.0

  * The default thunk specification ("v6") now uses a pinned version of nixpkgs, rather than the magic `<nixpkgs>`, for fetching thunks. This ensures that thunks can be fetched even in an environment where `NIX_PATH` is unset.

  ## 0.3.0.0

  * Fix readThunk when thunk is checked out [#4](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/nix-thunk/pull/4)
  * Fix removal of .git from default destination [#10](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/nix-thunk/pull/10)

  ## 0.2.0.3

  * Default to GHC 8.8.4 and update dependency bounds

  ## 0.2.0.2
  * Add support for GHC 8.8.4.

  ## 0.2.0.1
  * Fix parsing of --rev arguments

  ## 0.2.0.0
  * Add nix-thunk create.  This caused some minor breakage to the Haskell library API, but not the Nix or command line interfaces.

  ## 0.1.0.0
  * Initial release.  Extracted the Nix part of this code from https://github.com/obsidiansystems/reflex-platform and the Haskell part from https://github.com/obsidiansystems/obelisk

  nix-thunk is a lightweight Nix dependency manager, focused on making it easy to contribute improvements back to libraries you depend on.

  nix-thunk does this by creating and managing "thunks" - directories that stand in for full git repositories.
  Like git submodules, they pin a specific commit of the target repository, but unlike git submodules, you don't have to clone them to use them.
  nix-thunk makes them "transparent" to Nix scripts, so any script that calls `import path/to/some/thunk` will work the same on the thunk as it does on the original repository.

  ## Installation

  ```bash
  nix-env -f https://github.com/obsidiansystems/nix-thunk/archive/master.tar.gz -iA command
  ```

  **WARNING**: It is _not_ possible to compile `nix-thunk` without Nix.
  To ensure that packed thunks are buildable even in environments where diamond paths are unavailable (specifically `<nixpkgs>`), `nix-thunk` _must_ be built with knowledge of a known-good nixpkgs, _and_ for `nix-thunk` to be able to manipulate these thunks, it must _always_ be the same version of nixpkgs.

  ## Command Usage

  ### Create a dependency

  ```bash
  nix-thunk create https://example.com/some-dep
  ```

  If you have already cloned the dependency as a git repository, you can just `pack` it instead:

  ```bash
  nix-thunk pack some-dep
  ```

  ### Work on a dependency

  If you discover a bug fix or improvement that your dependency needs, you can use `nix-thunk unpack path/to/your/dependency` to turn the thunk back into a full checkout of the repository.
  Your Nix scripts should continue working, and you can modify the dependency's source code, push it to a branch or a fork, send a pull request, and then use `nix-thunk pack path/to/your/dependency` to pack it back up into a thunk.
  When the dependency accepts your pull request, you can easily update the thunk.

  ```bash
  nix-thunk unpack some-dep
  # Improve some-dep and push your work to a branch
  nix-thunk pack some-dep
  ```

  ### Update a dependency

  For routine updates, you can run `nix-thunk update path/to/your/dependency` to point the thunk at the latest version of the dependency without needing to do a `nix-thunk unpack` or a `git clone`.

  ```bash
  nix-thunk update some-dep
  ```

  ## Nix Usage

  The [`default.nix`](default.nix) file in this repository defines the nix function, `thunkSource`.
  This can be used in your nix files to access the contents of thunks.
  In the following example, a thunk is used in place of the source location argument to `callCabal2nix`.
  `thunkSource` works whether the thunk is packed or unpacked, making it convenient to run nix commands with modified thunks.

  ```nix
    haskellPackages = pkgs.haskell.packages.ghc865.override {
      overrides = self: super: {
        which = self.callCabal2nix "which" (thunkSource ./dep/which) {};
      };
    };
  ```

  You can also represent in nix all the thunks of a given directory
  ```nix
  let sources = nix-thunk.mapSubdirectories nix-thunk.thunkSource ./dep;
  ```
  ```nix
  { which = self.callCabal2nix "which" sources.which {}; }
  ```

  You can also access subfolders of a thunk.
  For example:

  ```nix
  {
    imports = [ "${builtins.fetchTarball <some-tar-url>}/path/to/subfolder" ];
  }
  ```
  becomes
  ```
  {
    imports = [ "${nix-thunk.thunkSource <thunk-location>}/path/to/subfolder>" ];
  }
  ```
