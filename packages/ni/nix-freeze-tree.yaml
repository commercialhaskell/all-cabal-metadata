  # `nix-freeze-tree`

  [![builds.sr.ht status](https://builds.sr.ht/~jack/nix-freeze-tree.svg)](https://builds.sr.ht/~jack/nix-freeze-tree?)
  [![AGPLv3](https://git.sr.ht/~jack/nix-freeze-tree/blob/master/AGPLv3.png)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html)

  `nix-freeze-tree` is a utility that walks a directory tree, and writes
  out [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) expressions which rebuild that
  tree. The generated expressions have two important properties:

  1. Each file in the tree is built by a separate fixed-output
     derivation, and

  2. Directories are built by derivations that symlink their contents
     recursively.

  If you are using `nix copy` to ship a derivation between nix stores,
  copying the derivation built by evaluating the output of
  `nix-freeze-tree` can reuse existing files in the destination store,
  as fixed-output derivations can be checked against a hash before
  copying.

  I use this to speed up deploys to my personal website. Running
  `nix-freeze-tree` on the output from [my site
  generator](https://git.sr.ht/~jack/jackkelly-name) and importing the
  result means that `nix copy` only uploads new files, instead of
  copying a single giant derivation containing every image on the site.


  ## Installation

  ### Nix

  If you use Nix, you can install the command into your local
  environment by running `nix profile install
  sourcehut:~jack/nix-freeze-tree`. If you're not using flakes, you can
  instead try `nix-env -f
  https://git.sr.ht/~jack/nix-freeze-tree/archive/master.tar.gz -iA
  command`.

  ### Cabal

  If you have GHC installed, you can also build and install the binary
  by running `cabal v2-install nix-freeze-tree`. You can also run the
  binary from the build directory with `cabal v2-run nix-freeze-tree --
  ARGS`.


  ## Usage

  ```
  Usage: nix-freeze-tree [--version] [-f|--force] [-v|--verbose]
                         [-o|--out-root OUT_ROOT] [IN_DIR]
    Write a tree of nix expressions to OUT_ROOT that build a derivation,
    symlinking every file in IN_DIR as a separate fixed-output derivation.

  Available options:
    --version                Display version information and exit.
    -h,--help                Show this help text
    -f,--force               If any default.nix exist in the output directory,
                             remove them and generate anyway
    -v,--verbose             Display messages while working.
    -o,--out-root OUT_ROOT   Where to write the nix files (default: IN_DIR)
    IN_DIR                   Directory to freeze (default: .)
  ```


  ## Calling from Nix

  This repository's flake defines a function `lib.${system}.freeze`,
  which can be used to freeze the output of an existing derivation. You
  can use it like this:

  ```nix
  {
    inputs = {
      flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
      nix-freeze-tree = "git+https://git.sr.ht/~jack/nix-freeze-tree"
    };

    outputs = inputs@{ ... }:
      inputs.flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:
        {
          defaultPackage = (import nix-freeze-tree { }).lib.${system}.freeze
            some-derivation-to-be-frozen;
        }
      );
  }
  ```

  The `freeze` function corresponding to `builtins.currentSystem` is
  also exposed in `default.nix`, so you can use it with Nix code that looks
  a bit like:

  ```nix
  let
    # Some nixpkgs from somewhere
    nixpkgs = ...;

    # Whether you get it from a channel, a local checkout,
    # builtins.fetchTarball or builtins.fetchgit is up to you
    nix-freeze-tree-repo = builtins.fetchTarball { ... };

    # Derivation to freeze
    drv = mkDerivation { ... };

    # Evaluate default.nix from nix-freeze-tree-repo and hold onto the
    # freeze function
    freeze = (import nix-freeze-tree-repo { inherit nixpkgs; }).freeze;
  in
    freeze drv
  ```


  ## FAQ

  Q: Why didn't you use
  [`symlinkJoin`](https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/manual/#chap-trivial-builders)
  to tie all the subtrees together?

  A: I had the program mostly working before I remembered that
  `symlinkJoin` existed. I thought about making each file's derivation
  contain the directories leading up to it and then `symlinkJoin`ing
  them all together, but decided against it for three reasons:

  1. You can easily build subtrees using the Nix expressions generated
     by `nix-freeze-tree`;
  2. Building the output of `nix-freeze-tree` will correctly create
     empty directories present in the input; and
  3. Files are hashed based on their content alone, not their position
     in the tree-to-be-frozen (reducing duplication).
