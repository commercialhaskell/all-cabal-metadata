description: "# Summary\n\n[![Tests](https://github.com/yesodweb/haskell-xss-sanitize/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yesodweb/haskell-xss-sanitize/actions/workflows/tests.yml)\n\nxss-sanitize
  allows you to accept html from untrusted sources by first filtering it through a
  white list.\nThe white list filtering is fairly comprehensive, including support
  for css in style attributes, but there are limitations enumerated below.\n\nSanitizing
  allows a web application to safely use a rich text editor, allow html in comments,
  or otherwise display untrusted HTML.\n\nIf you trust the HTML (you wrote it), you
  do not need to use this.\nIf you don't trust the html you probably also do not trust
  that the tags are balanced and should use the sanitizeBalance function.\n\n# Usage\n\nprovides
  2 functions in the module Text.HTML.SanitizeXSS\n\n* sanitize - filters html to
  prevent XSS attacks.\n* sanitizeBalance - same as sanitize but makes sure there
  are no lone opening/closing tags - useful to protect against a user's html messing
  up your page\n\n\n# Details\n\nThis is not escaping! Escaping html does prevent
  XSS attacks. Strings (that aren't meant to be HTML) should be HTML escaped to show
  up properly and to prevent XSS attacks. However, escaping will ruin the display
  of actual HTML.\n\nThis function removes any HTML tags or attributes that are not
  in its white-list. This may sound picky, but most HTML should make it through unchanged,
  making the process unnoticeable to the user but giving us safe HTML. \n\n\n## Integration\n\nIt
  is recommended to integrate this so that it is automatically used whenever an application
  receives untrusted html data (instead of before it is displayed). See the Yesod
  web framework as an example.\n\n\n## Limitations\n\n### Lowercase\n\nAll tag names
  and attribute names are converted to lower case as a matter of convenience. If you
  have a use case where this is undesirable let me know.\n\n### Balancing - sanitizeBalance\n\nThe
  goal of this function is to prevent your html from breaking when (unknown) html
  with unbalanced tags are placed inside it. I would expect it to work very well in
  practice and don't see a downside to using it unless you have an alternative approach.
  However, this function does not at all guarantee valid html. In fact, it is likely
  that the result of balancing will still be invalid HTML. There is no guarantee for
  how a browser will display invalid HTML, so there is no guarantee that this function
  will protect your HTML from being broken by a user's html. Other possible approaches
  would be to run the HTML through a library like libxml2 which understands HTML or
  to first render the HTML in a hidden iframe or hidden div at the bottom of the page
  so that it is isolated, and then use JavaScript to insert it into the page where
  you want it.\n\n### TagSoup Parser\n\nTagSoup is used to parse the HTML, and it
  does a good job. However TagSoup does not maintain all white space. TagSoup does
  not distinguish between the following cases:\n\n    <a href=\"foo\">, <a href=foo>\n
  \   <a   href>, <a href>\n    <a></a>, <a/>\n\nIn the third case, img and br tags
  will be output as a single self-closing tags. Other self-closing tags will be output
  as an open and closing pair. So `<img /> or <img><img>` converts to `<img />`, and
  `<a></a> or <a/>` converts to `<a></a>`.  There are future updates to TagSoup planned
  so that TagSoup will be able to render tags exactly the same as they were parsed.\n\n\n##
  Security\n\n### Where is the white list from?\n\nUltimately this is where your security
  comes from. I would expect that a faulty white list would act as a strong deterrent,
  but this library strives for correctness.\n\nThe [source code of html5lib](https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-python/blob/master/html5lib/filters/sanitizer.py)
  is the source of the white list and my implementation reference. If you feel a tag
  is missing from the white list, check to see if it has been added there.\n\nIf anyone
  knows of better sources or thinks a particular tag/attribute/value may be vulnerable,
  please let me know.\n[HTML Purifier](http://htmlpurifier.org/live/smoketests/printDefinition.php)
  does have a more permissive and configurable (yet safe) white list if you are looking
  to add anything.\n\n### Where is the code from?\n\nOriginal code was taken from
  John MacFarlane's Pandoc (with permission), but modified by Greg Weber to be faster
  and with parsing redone using TagSoup, and to use html5lib's white list.\nMichael
  Snoyman added the balanced tags functionality and released css-text specifically
  to help with css parsing.\nhtml5lib's sanitizer.py is used as a reference implementation,
  and most of the code should look the same. The css parsing is different: as mentioned
  we use a css parser, not regexes like html5lib.\n\n### style attribute\n\nstyle
  attributes are now parsed with the css-text and autoparsec-text dependencies. They
  are then ran through a white list for properties and keywords. Whitespace is not
  preserved. This code was again translated from sanitizer.py, but uses attoparsec
  instead of regexes. If you don't care about stripping css you can avoid the attoparsec
  dependendcy by using the older < 0.3 version of this library.\n\n### data attributes\n\ndata
  attributes are not on the white list.\nThe href and style attributes are white listed,
  but its values must pass through a white list also. This is how the data attributes
  could work also.\n\n### svg and mathml\n\nA mathml white list is fully implemented.
  There is some support for svg styling. \nThere is a full white list for svg elements
  and attributes. However, some elements are not included because they need further
  filtering (just like the data attributes) and this has not been done yet.\n"
