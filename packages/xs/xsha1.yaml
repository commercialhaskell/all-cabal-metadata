  Caution: XSHA1 is weak, and should not be used as a hash.

  XSHA1 is used in password and CD key authentication in older Blizzard games
  (Starcraft, Diablo 2) among other things. The fact that it's cryptographically
  weak has been known for years: this is a public analysis of the weakness. The
  goal is to determine risk posed to users, and find safeguards if possible.


  The code is geared for rapid interactive development with GHCI. Excuse the lax conventions.

  Data.Digest.* implements and explores XSHA1, while Data.Codec.* contains applications.
