  # OpenID Connect 1.0 library for Relying Party

  [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/krdlab/haskell-oidc-client.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/krdlab/haskell-oidc-client)

  This package supports implementing of an OpenID Connect 1.0 Relying Party. It's written in Haskell.

  This package uses [jose-jwt](http://github.com/tekul/jose-jwt) package for decoding a received tokens.

  ## Usage

  ```sh
  $ cabal update
  $ cabal install oidc-client
  ```

  The documentation is available in [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/oidc-client).

  ## Run example

  `examples/scotty` is a runnable code. If you try to run it, execute commands as follows:

  ```sh
  $ stack build --flag oidc-client:build-examples
  ```

  and then

  ```sh
  $ export OPENID_CLIENT_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
  $ export OPENID_CLIENT_ID="Your client ID"
  $ export OPENID_CLIENT_SECRET="Your client secret"
  $ stack exec scotty-example
  ```

  You can access to <http://localhost:3000/login>.
