  Zenacy HTML is an HTML parsing and processing library that implements the
  WHATWG HTML parsing standard.  The standard is described as a state machine
  that this library implements exactly as spelled out including all the error
  handling, recovery, and conformance checks that makes it robust in handling
  any HTML pulled from the web.  In addition to parsing, the library provides
  many processing features to help extract information from web pages or
  rewrite them and render the modified results.

  ## Introduction

  The Zenacy HTML parser is an implementation of the HTML parsing standard
  defined by the WHATWG.

  https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html

  The standard defines a parsing state machine, so it is very prescriptive
  on how HTML is handled including many edge cases and error recovery.
  This library aims to follow the standard closely in such a way to match the
  code back to the standard and make future updates straightforward.

  One of the main uses an a HTML parser is for extracting information from
  the web.  Having a parser that can handle all the nuances of poorly
  formatted HTML helps to make this extraction as robust as possible.
  This was a key motivation in deciding to implement a parser in this fashion.
  Additionally, the standard describes the algorithms needed to produce the
  correct document structure.  Applications that are sensitive to the
  document structure, such as extracting and rewriting large portions of
  a web page, may benefit from Zenacy HTML.

  The library provides a wide variety of features including:

  * A fully standard compliant HTML parser
  * HTML Fragment parsing
  * Document rendering
  * A zipper type for document traversal
  * An iterator type for document walking
  * Various functions for processing aspects of HTML
  * Lightweight queries for rewriting

  ## Parsing

  The library is designed to be imported unqualified.

  ```haskell
  import Zenacy.HTML
  ```

  The `htmlParseEasy` function can be used to parse an HTML document string
  and return the document model.

  ```haskell
  htmlParseEasy "<div>HelloWorld</div>"
  ```

  Note that some of the missing elements where automatically added to
  the document structure as required by the standard.

  ```haskell
  HTMLDocument ""
    [ HTMLElement "html" HTMLNamespaceHTML []
      [ HTMLElement "head" HTMLNamespaceHTML [] []
      , HTMLElement "body" HTMLNamespaceHTML []
        [ HTMLElement "div" HTMLNamespaceHTML []
          [ HTMLText "HelloWorld" ] ] ] ]
  ```

  The parsed result can also be rendered using `htmlRender`.

  ```haskell
  htmlRender $ htmlParseEasy "<div>HelloWorld</div>"
  ```

  The resulting rendered document appears like so.

  ```html
  <html><head></head><body><div>HelloWorld</div></body></html>
  ```

  ## Rewriting

  This example illustrates a function that converts span elements to divs.

  ```haskell
  rewrite :: Text -> Text
  rewrite = htmlRender . htmlMapElem f . fromJust . htmlDocHtml . htmlParseEasy
    where
      f x
        | htmlElemHasName "span" x = htmlElemRename "div" x
        | otherwise = x

  rewrite "<span>Hello</span><span>World</span>"
  ```

  Running the above gives the modified document.

  ```html
  <html><head></head><body><div>Hello</div><div>World</div></body></html>
  ```

  ## Extraction

  The next example shows one way to find all the hyperlinks in a document.
  This solution recurses over the document elements while ignoring fragments
  and templates.

  ```haskell
  extract :: Text -> [Text]
  extract = go . htmlParseEasy
    where
      go = \case
        HTMLDocument n c ->
          concatMap go c
        e @ (HTMLElement "a" s a c) ->
          case htmlElemAttrFind (htmlAttrHasName "href") e of
            Just (HTMLAttr n v s) ->
              v : concatMap go c
            Nothing ->
              concatMap go c
        HTMLElement n s a c ->
          concatMap go c
        _otherwise ->
          []

  extract "<a href=\"https://example1.com\"></a><a href=\"https://example2.com\"></a>"
  ```

  The extract function will give the following list.

  ```haskell
  [ "https://example1.com"
  , "https://example2.com"
  ]
  ```

  ## Queries

  The library includes a basic query facility implemented as a thin wrapper
  around an `HTMLZipper`.  Queries match patterns in HTML structures and can
  be used to extract information or update documents.  As a first example,
  consider the following HTML.

  ```html
  <p>
    <span id="x" class="y z"></span>
    <br>
    <a href="bbb">AAA</a>
    <img>
  </p>
  ```

  The HTML can be parsed as normal.  Note though the additional step of
  whitespace removal, which is often important in documents that include
  indentation such as above.

  ```haskell
  fromJust . htmlSpaceRemove . fromJust . htmlDocBody . htmlParseEasy
  ```

  Now a query function can be defined.  This function expects to be given
  a `body` element whose first child is a `p` element whose first child
  has an id of `x` whose second sibling is an anchor element.  If all of
  those conditions are met, the the text contents of the anchor is returned.

  ```haskell
  query :: HTMLNode -> Maybe Text
  query = htmlQueryExec $ do
    htmlQueryName "body"
    htmlQueryFirst
    htmlQueryName "p"
    htmlQueryFirst
    htmlQueryId "x"
    htmlQueryNext
    htmlQueryNext
    htmlQueryName "a"
    a <- htmlQueryNode
    htmlQuerySucc $
      fromMaybe "" $ htmlElemText a
  ```

  Running the query on the parsed document will give the result.

  ```haskell
  Just "AAA"
  ```

  Queries can also be used to modifiy documents.  In the next example, let's
  say we would like to find any `img` that is the only content in a `div` and
  replace the `div` with a link.  The document could look as follows.

  ```html
  <section><div><img src="aaa"></div></section>
  <section><div><img src="bbb"></div></section>
  <section><div><img src="ccc"></div></section>
  ```

  A query function can be defined to match the desired pattern and return the
  modified element.

  ```haskell
  query2 :: HTMLNode -> HTMLNode
  query2 = htmlQueryTry $ do
    htmlQueryName "div"
    htmlQueryOnly "img"
    a <- htmlQueryNode
    let Just b = htmlElemGetAttr "src" a
    htmlQuerySucc $
      htmlElem "a" [ htmlAttr "href" b ]
        [ htmlText b ]
  ```

  The query can then be applied to the entire document using `htmlMapElem`.

  ```haskell
  htmlMapElem query2
  ```

  Rendering the mapped query with give the updated content.

  ```html
  <section><a href="aaa">aaa</a></section>
  <section><a href="bbb">bbb</a></section>
  <section><a href="ccc">ccc</a></section>
  ```

  ## Samples

  The unit tests include the above samples as well as many other example
  usages of the library.

  ## Origin

  Zenacy HTML was originally developed for Zenacy Reader Technologies LLC
  starting around 2015 and used in a web reading SaaS for a few years.
  The need to understand and handle the wide variety and sublties of HTML
  found on the web lead to the development of library that closely followed
  the standard.  The library was tweaked and optimized a bit and though
  there is room for more improvements the result worked quite well in
  production (a lot of credit goes to the GHC team and Haskell community
  for providing such great, fast functional programming tools).
