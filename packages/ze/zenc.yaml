  # Text.Encoding.Z

  ## The Z-encoding

  `zEncodeString` is a name-encoding and decoding function. It encodes any ascii
  string into a string that is acceptable as a C name. This is code was originally
  part of GHC and used right before emitting a symbol name into the compiled C or
  asm code.  This library was created as this encoding is useful when working with
  GHC compiled code or generally when C-compatible name mangling is desired.

  `zDecodeString` is the inverse operation.
