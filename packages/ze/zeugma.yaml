  # About

  This Haskell library provides test runners for [incipit](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/incipit)-based projects,
  building on [polysemy-test](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polysemy-test), which uses
  [hedgehog](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedgehog) and [tasty](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty).

  It is mere convenience to avoid the necessity of manually interpreting the commonly used effects from the bundle of
  libraries that constitute Incipit.
  Consult [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/zeugma/docs/Zeugma.html) for the list of runners.
