  Zeolite is an experimental general-purpose programming language. See
  <https://github.com/ta0kira/zeolite Zeolite on GitHub> for more details.

  The installation process is still a bit rough, and therefore must be done in a
  few stages:

  * Ensure that you have a C++ compiler such as @clang++@ or @g++@ installed,
  and an archiver such as @ar@ installed, all callable from a shell.
  * Install the binaries using @cabal@. After this step, the compiler itself is
  installed, but it cannot actually create executables from source code.

  @
  cabal install zeolite-lang
  @

  * Execute the setup binary that gets installed by @cabal@. This will give you
  a series of prompts to verify the binaries above. It will then
  automatically build the supporting libraries.

  @
  zeolite-setup
  @

  * (Optional) Once the setup above is completed, you should run the
  integration tests to ensure that code can be compiled and run. These can
  take quite a while to complete. Please create an
  <https://github.com/ta0kira/zeolite/issues issue on GitHub> if you encounter
  any errors.

  @
  ZEOLITE_PATH=$(zeolite --get-path)
  zeolite -p "$ZEOLITE_PATH" -t tests lib\/file lib\/util
  @

  The <https://github.com/ta0kira/zeolite/tree/master/example code examples> are
  located in @$ZEOLITE_PATH/example@. You should not normally need to use
  @$ZEOLITE_PATH@ outside of running included tests and examples.
