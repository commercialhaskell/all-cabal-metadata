description: "Embedded programming in haskell using the Copilot stream DSL and Zephyr\nzephyr-copilot
  contains allows using Haskell to program many boards\nsupported by the Zephyr project.\n\nzephyr-copilot
  uses the Copilot stream DSL (domain-specific language)\nand Functional Reactive
  Programming (FRP) to generate a program which\ncan be compiled in Zephyr and flashed
  to the board.\n\nSee Copilot.Zephyr for details on how to use write a program using
  this\nlibrary.\n\nFor example, to make a board blink its LED:\n\n\timport Copilot.Zephyr.Board.Generic\n\tmain
  = zephyr $ do\n\t\tled0 =: blinking\n\t\tdelay =: MilliSeconds (constant 100)\n\nThis
  and other examples are included in the Examples/ directory, each\nwith their own
  README explaining how to build and use them.\n\nCopilot is a stream (i.e., infinite
  lists) domain-specific language\n(DSL) in Haskell that compiles into embedded C.
  Copilot contains an\ninterpreter, multiple back-end compilers, and other verification
  tools.\n<https://copilot-language.github.io/>\n\nZephyr is a real time embedded
  operating system (RTOS) supporting\nhundreds of boards. <https://zephyrproject.org/>\n\n##
  Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome, including adding support for more parts
  of\nZephyr and more boards that are supported by Zephyr.\n\nAny contribution should
  have well documented functions and types.\n"
