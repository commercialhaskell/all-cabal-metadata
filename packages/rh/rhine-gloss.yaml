  # Revision history for rhine-gloss

  ## 1.4

  * Use `FreeAsyncT` in the gloss IO backend for fairer concurrency.
    See https://hackage.haskell.org/package/monad-schedule-0.2/docs/Control-Monad-Schedule-FreeAsync.html.
  * Improvements, utilities, and hardenings for the IO backend

  ## 1.3

  * Dropped `dunai` dependency in favour of state automata.
    See [the versions readme](./versions.md) for details.
  * Support GHC 9.6 and 9.8

  ## 1.1

  * dunai-0.11 compatibility
  * Fixed bug in IO backend

  ## 1.0

  * Removed schedules. See the [page about changes in version 1](/version1.md).
  * Simplified `gloss` backends. Renamed `launchGlossThread` to `launchInGlossThread`.

  ## 0.7.0

  * Reworked `gloss` backends.
    There are now two pure backends and an `IO` backend.

  ## 0.4.0.0 -- 2017.12.04

  * Version bump

  ## 0.3.0.0  -- 2017-11-30

  * Added simple example.

  ## 0.2.0.0  -- 2017-11-29

  * First version. Version numbers follow rhine.

  # README

  This package provides a simple wrapper for the `gloss` library,
  or rather the function `Graphics.Gloss.play`,
  enabling you to write `gloss` applications as signal functions.
  An example "gears" program, which you can run as `cabal run rhine-gloss-gears`
  or `stack build && stack exec rhine-gloss-gears`,
  now becomes as simple as:

  ```haskell
  module README where

  import FRP.Rhine.Gloss


  -- | Calculate a gear wheel rotated by a certain angle.
  gears :: Float -> Picture
  gears angle = color green $ pictures
    $ circleSolid 60
    : map (rotate angle) [ rotate (45 * n) $ rectangleSolid 20 150 | n <- [0..3] ]

  -- | Rotate the gear with a constant angular velocity.
  mainClSF :: GlossClSF
  mainClSF = timeInfoOf sinceInit >>> arr (* 50) >>> arr gears

  main :: IO ()
  main = flowGloss defaultSettings mainClSF
  ```

  ## Installation

  Since `gloss` is based on `OpenGL`,
  you will need to install the same dependencies as for that.
  Typically, this are the `GL`, `GLU` and `GLUT` libraries.
  (On Debian-like systems, `sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev` should suffice.)

  When building with `stack`, it is assumed that you have `nix-shell` installed,
  which will automatically get these dependencies for you.
