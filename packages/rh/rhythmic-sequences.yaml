description: "This is one of the core components of the other new project that uses
  the ideas similar to the ones in the project\nhttps://hackage.haskell.org/package/phonetic-languages-simplified-examples-array\nand
  \nhttps://hackage.haskell.org/package/phonetic-languages-simplified-genaralized-examples-array\nwith
  the general name of PhLADiPreLiO (phladiprelio) — Phonetic Languages Approach to\nDiscovering
  the Preferred Line Options — that is to the topic of creating\ntexts and music with
  some properties, e. g. poetic.\nSee: \nhttps://oleksandrzhabenko.github.io/uk/rhythmicity/PhLADiPreLiO.Eng.21.pdf\nhttps://oleksandrzhabenko.github.io/uk/rhythmicity/PhLADiPreLiO.Eng.21.html\n\nIt
  is the way to evaluate the rhythmic properties accordingly to the basic ideas there
  \nand to avoid the issues with the previous realization.\n\nP.S.: on the Day of
  publication of the package (27/02/2023), there is \nthe International Day of Non-Governmental
  Organizations. \nThe author would like to devote this project to support the Fund
  GASTROSTARS.\nIf you would like to share some financial support, please, contact
