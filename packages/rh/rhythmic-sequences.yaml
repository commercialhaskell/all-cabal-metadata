  # Revision history for rhythmic-sequence

  ## 0.1.0.0 -- 2023-02-27

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  ## 0.1.1.0 -- 2023-02-27

  * First version revised A. Fixed issue with being not compiled by the GHC-9.2 and higher.

  ## 0.1.2.0 -- 2023-02-27

  * First version revised B. Fixed another issue with being not compiled by the GHC-9.2 and higher.

  ## 0.1.2.1 -- 2023-02-27

  * First version revised C. Some minor documentation improvements.

  ## 0.1.3.0 -- 2023-02-27

  * First version revised D. Switched to sortOn instead of sortBy. The new variant can be more memory
  consuming, but it is generally speaking not worse in speed and for complex computations can lead
  to less computations.

description: "This is one of the core components of the other new project that uses
  the ideas similar to the ones in the project\nhttps://hackage.haskell.org/package/phonetic-languages-simplified-examples-array\nand
  \nhttps://hackage.haskell.org/package/phonetic-languages-simplified-genaralized-examples-array\nwith
  the general name of PhLADiPreLiO (phladiprelio) — Phonetic Languages Approach to\nDiscovering
  the Preferred Line Options — that is to the topic of creating\ntexts and music with
  some properties, e. g. poetic.\nSee: \nhttps://oleksandrzhabenko.github.io/uk/rhythmicity/PhLADiPreLiO.Eng.21.pdf\nhttps://oleksandrzhabenko.github.io/uk/rhythmicity/PhLADiPreLiO.Eng.21.html\n\nIt
  is the way to evaluate the rhythmic properties accordingly to the basic ideas there
  \nand to avoid the issues with the previous realization.\n\nP.S.: on the Day of
  publication of the package (27/02/2023), there is \nthe International Day of Non-Governmental
  Organizations. \nThe author would like to devote this project to support the Fund
  GASTROSTARS.\nIf you would like to share some financial support, please, contact
