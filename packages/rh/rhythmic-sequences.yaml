synopsis: Improved library to deal with rhythmicity of short sequences
changelog: "# Revision history for rhythmic-sequence\n\n## 0.1.0.0 -- 2023-02-27\n\n*
  First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n## 0.1.1.0 -- 2023-02-27\n\n*
  First version revised A. Fixed issue with being not compiled by the GHC-9.2 and
  higher.\n\n## 0.1.2.0 -- 2023-02-27\n\n* First version revised B. Fixed another
  issue with being not compiled by the GHC-9.2 and higher.\n\n## 0.1.2.1 -- 2023-02-27\n\n*
  First version revised C. Some minor documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.1.3.0 --
  2023-02-27\n\n* First version revised D. Switched to sortOn instead of sortBy. The
  new variant can be more memory\nconsuming, but it is generally speaking not worse
  in speed and for complex computations can lead\nto less computations.\n\n## 0.2.0.0
  -- 2023-03-10\n\n* Second version. Added the functions to read the HashCorrections
  data and the other needed for\ncountHashesG function.\n\n## 0.2.0.1 -- 2023-03-10\n\n*
  Second version revised A. Some documentation improvement.\n\n## 0.2.1.9 -- 2023-03-11\n\n*
  Second version revised B. Changed the defaults for the new functions. Added the
  possibility to\n  parse the '-' sign into the negative second parameter  in HashCorrections.\n\n##
  0.2.2.0 -- 2023-03-17\n\n* Second version revised C. Some performance improvements
  for splitF function. Documentation \nimprovements.\n\n## 0.2.3.0 -- 2023-03-17\n\n*
  Second version revised D. Fixed issue with undefined pattern matching. Modified
  the \nsplitF code with the usage of the modified Data.List.unfoldr code to improve
  performance.\nSome documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.2.3.1 -- 2023-03-17\n\n*
  Second version revised E. Some minor code improvement. Documentation improvements.\n\n##
  0.3.0.0 -- 2023-03-28\n\n* Third version. Added two generalized functions to Rhythmicity.MarkersSeqs
  module and one \n- to Rhythmicity.BasicF module. They allow to specify step of second
  hashing. Changed also\nthe values in the hashList function for the positive values
  of the second parameter in \nthe argument HashCorrections in it.\n\n## 0.4.0.0 --
  2023-08-14\n\n* Fourth version. Added a new function for working with points of
  incongruences showZerosFor2Period.\n\n## 0.4.1.0 -- 2023-10-01\n\n* Fourth version
  revised A. Added new function to be used in the \"music\" mode of PhLADiPreLiO.\n\n"

  the Preferred Line Options — that is to the topic of creating\ntexts and music with
  some properties, e. g. poetic.\n\nFor some theoretical end experimental background
  for the usage of the library and its successors,\nsee the papers below:\n\nSee for

  is the way to evaluate the rhythmic properties accordingly to the basic ideas there

  like to devote this project to support the Foundation GASTROSTARS.\nAt the day of
  publication of the first version of the package (12/03/2023) there is\nthe foundation
  founder's (this is [Emma Kok](https://www.emmakok.nl)) Birthday. \n\nOn the 01/10/2023
  there are International Music Day and [André's Rieu](https://www.andrerieu.com/en)
  Birthday. So the version 0.4.1.0 is\nadditionally devoted to him as well as to the
  Kok family — [Emma](https://emmakok.nl) and [Enzo](https://enzokok.nl) are amazing
  and fantastic musicians, Vico\nworks with PhilZuid, Sophie sings in the classical
  manner. Nathalie Kok with love to her family and \nappreciation for André's Rieu
  support also celebrates the Day. In Ukraine this day has several \nimportant celebrations
  — Intercession of the Holy Theotokos (Pokrova), Cossacks' Day, Day of Defenders
  of Ukraine (especially relevant during the Russian war against Ukraine).\n\nAll
  support is welcome, including donations for the needs of the Ukrainian army, IDPs
  and refugees. \n\nIf you would like to share some financial support with the Foundation
  Gastrostars, please, contact the mentioned foundation\nusing the URL:\n\n[Contact
