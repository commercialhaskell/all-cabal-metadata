synopsis: Library to deal with rhythmicity of short sequences
changelog: "# Revision history for rhythmic-sequence\n\n## 0.1.0.0 -- 2023-02-27\n\n*
  First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n\n## 0.1.1.0 -- 2023-02-27\n\n*
  First version revised A. Fixed issue with being not compiled by the GHC-9.2 and
  higher.\n\n## 0.1.2.0 -- 2023-02-27\n\n* First version revised B. Fixed another
  issue with being not compiled by the GHC-9.2 and higher.\n\n## 0.1.2.1 -- 2023-02-27\n\n*
  First version revised C. Some minor documentation improvements.\n\n## 0.1.3.0 --
  2023-02-27\n\n* First version revised D. Switched to sortOn instead of sortBy. The
  new variant can be more memory\nconsuming, but it is generally speaking not worse
  in speed and for complex computations can lead\nto less computations.\n\n## 0.2.0.0
  -- 2023-03-10\n\n* Second version. Added the functions to read the HashCorrections
  data and the other needed for\ncountHashesG function.\n\n## 0.2.0.1 -- 2023-03-10\n\n*
  Second version revised A. Some documentation improvement.\n\n## 0.2.1.9 -- 2023-03-11\n\n*
  Second version revised B. Changed the defaults for the new functions. Added the
  possibility to\n  parse the '-' sign into the negative second parameter  in HashCorrections.\n\n##
  0.2.2.0 -- 2023-03-17\n\n* Second version revised C. Some performance improvements
  for splitF function. Documentation \nimprovements.\n\n"

description: "This is one of the core components of the other new project that uses
  the ideas similar to the ones in the project\nhttps://hackage.haskell.org/package/phonetic-languages-simplified-examples-array\nand
  \nhttps://hackage.haskell.org/package/phonetic-languages-simplified-genaralized-examples-array\nwith
  the general name of PhLADiPreLiO (phladiprelio) — Phonetic Languages Approach to\nDiscovering
  the Preferred Line Options — that is to the topic of creating\ntexts and music with
  some properties, e. g. poetic.\nSee: \nhttps://oleksandrzhabenko.github.io/uk/rhythmicity/PhLADiPreLiO.Eng.21.pdf\nhttps://oleksandrzhabenko.github.io/uk/rhythmicity/PhLADiPreLiO.Eng.21.html\n\nIt
  is the way to evaluate the rhythmic properties accordingly to the basic ideas there
  \nand to avoid the issues with the previous realization.\n\nP.S.: the author would
  like to devote this project to support the Foundation GASTROSTARS.\nIf you would
  like to share some financial support, please, contact the foundation\nusing the
