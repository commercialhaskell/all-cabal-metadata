  ## Getting started

  To get started with the library, clone the repo and then install Haskell Stack.

  Next, build the project:

  ```
  $ stack build

  ```
  Documentation can be generated by running the next command:

  ```
  $ stack haddock

  ```

  Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

  ```
  $ stack test
  ```

  ## Documentation

  Documentation is available at [Doc](https://ardeleanasm.github.io/qchas/)
