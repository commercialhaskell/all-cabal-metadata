description: |-
  We provide the data type @NonEmpty@ that allows to store a list-like structure
  with at least or exactly @n@ elements,
  where @n@ is fixed in the type in a kind of Peano encoding
  and is usually small.
  The datatype is intended to increase safety
  by making functions total that are partial on plain lists.
  E.g. on a non-empty list, 'head' and 'tail' are always defined.

  There are more such data types like @Optional@ and @Empty@.
  Together with @NonEmpty@ you can define a list type
  for every finite set of admissible list lengths.

  The datatype can be combined with Lists, Sequences and Sets
  (from the @containers@ package).

  The package needs only Haskell 98.

  Similar packages:

  * @semigroups@, @semigroupoids@:
  restricted to lists, minimum number of elements: 1,
  provides more type classes tailored to the use of non-empty lists.

  * @NonEmptyList@:
  restricted to lists, minimum number of elements: 1

  * @NonEmpty@:
  restricted to lists, minimum number of elements: 1,
  designed for unqualified use of identifiers

  * @Cardinality@:@NeverEmptyList@

  * @mono-traversable@:@Data.MinLen@:
  allows to specify a minimum number of elements using type families
  and works also for monomorphic data structures like 'ByteString'

  Related packages:

  * @Stream@:
  Lists that contain always infinitely many elements.

  * @fixed-length@:
  Uses the data structure of this package
  and defines a closed-world class for fixed-length lists
  and an according index type.

  * @fixed-list@:
  Uses the same data structure as this package
  but is intended for fixing the number of elements in a list.
  Requires multi-parameter type classes with functional dependencies.
