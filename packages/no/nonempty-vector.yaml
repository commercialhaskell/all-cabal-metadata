  # Revision history for nonempty-vector

  ## 0.2.2.0

  * Drop support for GHC<8.10, update CI, bump bounds for `primitive`.
  * Added `partitionWith` from `vector`. [(#11)](https://github.com/emilypi/nonempty-vector/pull/11) - Thanks @AlistairB!

  ## 0.2.1.0

  * Added `consV` and `snocV` primitives for consing a vector to create a nonempty one. [(#8)](https://github.com/emilypi/nonempty-vector/pull/8) - Thanks @AlistairB!
  * Updated CI and cabal support
  * Expose constructors in new `Data.Vector.NonEmpty.Internal` module
  * Modules are now marked trustworthy
  * `@since` annotations have been added.

  ## 0.2.0.2

  * Removed spurious dependency on `semigroups`

  ## 0.2.0.1

  * Missed a strictness tick in `postscanl'`

  * INLINE pragma for slice

  ## 0.2.0.0

  * Remove naughty `Generic`, and `Alternative` instances as they can construct empty `NonEmptyVector`s

  * Handwritten `Read` and `Read1` instances with safe cons

  * Added `uncons`, `unsnoc`, `replicate1`, `generate1`, `iterateN1`, `unsafeCreate`, `unsafeCreateT`, `unfoldr1`, `unfoldr1N`, `unfoldr1M`, `unfoldr1NM`,

  * Added `unsafeFromList`, `unsafeFromVector`, and `fromNonEmptyN1`

  * Add `ifilterM`

  * Add doctests for all new functions + many familiar ones

  ## 0.1.0.0

  * Remove `MonadFail` instance for the sake of backcompat with LTS < 13
  * Drop Cabal version down to 2.0

  ## 0.0.1.1 -- 2019-10-20

  * Export `toMVector` and `fromMVector`
  * clean up docs

  ## 0.0.1.0 -- 2019-10-20

  * First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.

  # Non-empty Vectors

  ![Build Status](https://github.com/emilypi/nonempty-vector/workflows/CI/badge.svg) [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/nonempty-vector.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nonempty-vector)

  This package presents thin wrappers around mutable and immutable [Data.Vector](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector) types. The entire Vector API is supported for both sets of boxed vectors, with future plans to support unboxed, primitive, storable, and generic vectors.

  There are no external dependencies that are not already in `base`.

  ### Motivation

  Every "container" in the Haskell ecosystem features a [non-empty variant](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nonempty-containers), including the venerable [list](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/semigroups), aside from `vector`. Many (including myself) use `vector` for its incredible performance characteristics achieved over many years by the CLC and authors of the library. But many of us also want to adhere to the principle of least power, and not have to worry about whether `head` or `tail` (for example) are safe. This package addresses both of the previous points. No new pointer indirection is exposed by this library except at construction (and even then - `unsafe` constructors are supplied), with as much reuse of `vector`'s library as possible to make sure asymptotics stay the same.
