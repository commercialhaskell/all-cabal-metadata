changelog: "ChangeLog\n\nv0.3.0.0 2022/11/15\n\t(2022/11/15) PS1 - removed an unused
  import, and added a module\n\tdeclaration to keep Haddock happy.\n\t(2022/11/03)
  PS1 - many documentation fixes.\n\t(2022/11/03) PS1 - documented the need for -fno-cse.\n\t(2018/11/11)
  PS1 - replaced '.' by ':.' as the notation for\n\tabstraction. This solves two problems:
  (1) we now use the same\n\tnotation for the constructor and the pattern, and (2)
  we don't\n\tneed to hide (.) from the Prelude.\n\t(2018/11/11) PS1 - added more
  details on referential transparency\n\tand equivariance.\n\t(2018/11/10) PS1 - minor
  delinting, suggested by John Pavel.\n\t(2018/11/10) PS1 - added a type annotation
  to fix a compiler warning.\n\t(2018/11/10) PS1 - rearranged module dependencies
  and moved some\n\tinstance declaration to avoid an orphaned instance declaration.\n\t(2018/11/10)
  PS1 - fixed spurious incomplete pattern match\n\twarnings for abstraction patterns.\n\nv0.2.0.0
  2018/11/10\n\t(2018/11/09) PS1 - documentation updates: added related works,\n\tacknowledgements,
  and references. Added a README file for\n\tbitbucket.\n\t(2018/11/09) PS1 - renamed
  Nominal.Generics as Nominal.Generic.\n\t(2018/11/09) PS1 - added type class instances
  for Ordering, Maybe,\n\tand Either.\n\t(2018/11/09) PS1 - renamed NominalPattern
  to NominalBinder, to\n\tavoid confusion between Haskell patterns and Nominal binders.\n\t(2018/11/09)
  PS1 - added abstraction patterns (:.).\n\t(2018/11/09) PS1 - removed unused open2
  functions.\n\nv0.1.0.0 2018/11/08\n\tInitial public release.\n"

description: |-
  An efficient and easy-to-use library for defining datatypes with
  binders, and automatically handling bound variables and
  alpha-equivalence. It is based on Gabbay and Pitts's theory of
  nominal sets.
