description: "# Notmuch Web Client\n\nThis project is an email client for [notmuch](http://notmuchmail.org)
  written in\n[Haskell](http://www.haskell.org) and [Yesod](http://www.yesodweb.com).
  \ The code implements a web\nserver and uses [bootstrap](http://twbs.github.io/bootstrap/)
  and [jquery](http://jquery.com/)\nfor the UI.  The current features are\n\n* Search
  messages - [search\n  screenshot](https://bitbucket.org/wuzzeb/notmuch-web/src/tip/screenshots/search.png)
  and [pager\n  screenshot](https://bitbucket.org/wuzzeb/notmuch-web/src/tip/screenshots/pager.png)\n
  \   * link default searches from the navigation bar\n    * view results in a table,
  with customizable buttons for retagging each thread\n    * view results in a pager,
  which shows the thread content together with a navigation bar with\n      \"Next\"
  button plus tagging buttons.\n    * Opensearch.xml integration, so you can add notmuch-web
  as a search engine to your web browser.\n* View individual threads\n    * a visible
  tree structure and the ability to collapse individual messages\n    * download attachments
  from messages\n    * customizable tagging buttons on each message\n    * On small
  screens (under 700 pixels width like phones), parse text messages as markdown and\n
  \     display the original text message together with the resulting markdown HTML.
  \ This allows the\n      message to be flowed to fit the small screen, but still
  allows one to view the original\n      message.  On larger screens, the original
  message is displayed by default but the markdown\n      HTML is available in a tab.\n*
  Compose email\n    * sending with attachments\n    * supports reply and reply all\n
  \   * for composing messages, I recommend [Its All\n      Text](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/its-all-text/)
  to use your favorite\n      editor.\n    * An optional address book.  Addresses
  can either be loaded from\n      [abook](http://abook.sourceforge.net/) on the server
  (abook must be in the path) or from\n      Google Contacts (loading from Google
  contacts requires a setting change in settings.yml).\n* Execute a raw notmuch command
  and view the results\n\n[ChangeLog](https://bitbucket.org/wuzzeb/notmuch-web/src/tip/ChangeLog)\n\n#
  Quickstart\n\nTo quickly test out the client on linux, make sure you have libgmp
  and zlib installed,\n[download the latest binary](https://bitbucket.org/wuzzeb/notmuch-web/downloads),
  extract the\ntarball, then run\n\n~~~ {.bash}\n$ mv config/settings.example.yml
  config/settings.yml\n$ ./notmuch-web Testing\n~~~\n\nYou can now visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
  and use \"hunter2\" as the password.\n\n# Install\n\n#### Binaries \n\nOne nice
  feature of GHC (the Haskell compiler) is the ability to statically link all the
  Haskell\nlibraries to not require Haskell to be installed (C libraries are still
  dynamically linked).  I have\ntherefore built the latest release; you can find the
  tarballs on the [download\npage](https://bitbucket.org/wuzzeb/notmuch-web/downloads).
  \ The only prerequisites are glibc,\nlibgmp, and zlib.  The binaries are missing
  one feature: use of\n[libicu](http://site.icu-project.org/) to decode text/html
  message parts that have a charset that is\nnot ISO-8859 or UTF-8 (UTF-8 and ISO-8859
  are decoded internally without the help of libicu).  The\nreason for this restriction
  is that libicu is not generally binary compatible between different\nversions, so
  I could not link against a version of libicu that worked on many distributions.
  \ This\nrestriction will be removed once the next version of notmuch is released
  (it will include some\npatches I submitted).\n\n#### Source, latest released version\n\nTo
  compile the latest release from source, install the [Haskell\nPlatform](http://www.haskell.org/platform/).
  \ Next, install notmuch-web from the latest released\nversion on [hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/notmuch-web).
  \ To do this, from the shell\nrun\n\n~~~ {.bash}\n$ cabal update\n$ cd ~/software/notmuch-build-dir
  \ # Or some path\n$ cabal sandbox init               # Requires Cabal 1.18, can
  be skipped\n$ cabal install notmuch-web\n~~~\n\nThe binary will appear at `.cabal-sandbox/bin/notmuch-web`
  or `~/.cabal/bin/notmuch-web` and the\nconfiguration files (see below) are in either
  `.cabal-sandbox/share/notmuch-web-version` or\n`~/.cabal/share/notmuch-web-version`
  depending on if you used a sandbox.\n\n#### Source, from bitbucket\n\nTo compile
  from bitbucket, install the Haskell Platform and then run \"cabal update\".  Next,
  clone\nfrom bitbucket and within the notmuch-web directory, run `cabal sandbox init`
  (if you have Cabal\n1.18) and then `cabal install --only-dependencies`.  Next, run
  \"cabal install yesod-bin\"  (yesod-bin\nis a development helper binary).  You can
  now run `yesod devel` to start the development server or\nuse the package.sh script
  to build a tarball.\n\n#### Keter\n\nAlthough I haven't used it, you might investigate
  [keter](https://github.com/snoyberg/keter) for\nautomatic building and deployment.
  See [this blog\npost](http://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2012/05/keter-app-deployment)
  and [this\none](http://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2012/05/keter-its-alive) for more information.\n\n#
  Configuration\n\nWhen launching the notmuch-web binary, it expects several files
  to be located in one subdirectory\nof the current directory.  No other configuration
  or install is needed, so you can copy the\nnotmuch-web binary and this folders anywhere,
  even deploy on computers with no Haskell\ninstalled.  _Note: in versions of notmuch-web
  before 0.2.0 there was a second folder which can be\ndeleted when you upgrade; see
  the Changelog._\n\nThe required folder is named `config` and must be in the current
  directory.  The\nconfig folder must contain:\n\n* robots.txt - this file is served
  as robots.txt as the root and by default denies all search\n  engines.  You can
  edit to your taste.\n* favicon.ico - this is served as the favicon and defaults
  to the notmuch favicon.  You can replace\n  with your own icon if you like.\n* client_session_key.aes
  - notmuch-web uses AES encrypted cookies to store session information and\n  the
  AES key is stored in this file.  If the file does not exist a new key is randomly
  generated and\n  placed in this file.  Make sure you keep this file private.\n*
  settings.yml - the [yaml](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file containing all
  the\n  configuration.  The binary tarballs contain a file settings.yml.example which
  should be copied to\n  settings.yml.  See the next section for the settings.\n\n###
  Settings\n\nnotmuch-web has four modes: Development, Testing, Staging, and Production.
  \ The mode is specified on\nthe command line when launching notmuch-web.  The settings.yml
  file is split into four sections, one\nfor each mode and notmuch-web will only load
  settings from the matching section of settings.yml.\nUsing yaml references a collection
  of default settings are copied into each section of the\nconfiguration.\n\nThe default
  settings.yml file is well commented so I won't explain it here.  The only required\nsetting
  that must be edited before notmuch-web will run is \"hashed-password\", the hash
  of the\npassword to access (see\n[pwstore](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/pwstore-fast/latest/doc/html/Crypto-PasswordStore.html)\nfor
  the format).  You can generate the hashed password by running \"notmuch-web --make-password\".\nOther
  settings like \"from-address\" and \"approot\" should be set as well for proper
  operation.\n\n# Running\n\nTo run, execute \"notmuch-web Production\".  This will
  start the server listening on the configured\nport.  notmuch-web accesses notmuch
  by launching the \"notmuch\" binary found in the PATH, so you must\nmake sure the
  user running notmuch-web has notmuch in the PATH, is able to access the email\ndirectory,
  and has a valid notmuch configuration.  You might need to set the NOTMUCH\\_CONFIG\nenvironment
  variable before launching notmuch-web.\n\nI use a systemd unit to start notmuch-web
  as my login user at boot, having notmuch-web listen on\nport 3000.  I then run [nginx](http://nginx.org/)
  with SSL on port 443, and have nginx reverse proxy\nto notmuch-web.\n\n#### SSL\n\nCurrently,
  notmuch-web does not implement SSL (although since Yesod/Warp supports SSL we could\nsupport
  it without too much work so it is on the TODO list).  Therefore, you will want to\nreverse-proxy
  notmuch-web.  I use [nginx](http://nginx.org/).\n\n#### Sending\n\nWhen you send
  a message, notmuch-web sends it using the executable \"/usr/sbin/sendmail\".  If
  you are\nnot running your own email server, I suggest [msmtp](http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/).
  \ I use msmtp on\nmy laptop, it works great.  Just make sure the user you run notmuch-web
  as has the correct msmtp\nconfiguration setup.\n"
