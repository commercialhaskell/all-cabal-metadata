description: |-
  This library implements numerical algorithms to optimize
  nonlinear functions.  Optimization means that we try to find
  a minimum of the function.  Currently all algorithms
  guarantee only that local minima will be found, not global
  ones.

  Almost any continuosly differentiable function @f : R^n -> R@
  may be optimized by this library.  Any further restrictions
  are listed in the modules that need them.

  We use the @vector@ package to represent vectors and
  matrices, although it would be possible to use something like
  @hmatrix@ easily.

  Currently only CG_DESCENT method is implemented.
