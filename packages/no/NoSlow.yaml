description: |2

  NoSlow is a benchmark suite for several Haskell array libraries:
  standard lists, primitive sequential arrays from the DPH project,
  uvector, vector (primitive, storable and boxed arrays) and
  storablevector. At the moment, it implements a bunch of fairly random
  loop micro-kernels and a couple of small array algorithms. It will
  include many more benchmarks in the future.

  In its present state, NoSlow /cannot/ be used to reliably compare the
  performance of the benchmarked libraries. It can be quite helpful for
  identifying cases where a closer inspection of the generated code
  might be warranted, however.

  The package builds two binaries: @noslow@ and @noslow-table@.

  [@noslow -o log@] runs the benchmarks and writes the results to 'log'

  [@noslow-table log -o table.html --html@] outputs the results from
  @log@ as a HTML table.

  [@noslow-table log -o table.html --raw --csv@] outputs the results
  from @log@ as a CSV file suitable for importing into spreadsheets.

  [@noslow-table --diff log1 log2@ -o table.html@] produces a table
  comparing the results from 'log1' and 'log2' (2 means the first run was
  2x slower than the second; 0.5 means 2x faster).

  [@noslow-table --help@] lists additional options.

  NoSlow is described in more detail here:
  <http://unlines.wordpress.com/2009/11/27/noslow/>.

  Changes since version 0.1

  * Renamed and reorganised loop kernels

  * Several small array algorithms organised in the new
  benchmark category @mini@

  * More reliable benchmark execution

  * Support for producing CSV files
