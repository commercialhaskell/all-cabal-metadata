changelog: |
  # 0.6

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE. `pFail` was removed in favour of
    `fail` from `Monad` of `MonadFail`.

  * Added instances for `Parser`: `Semigroup`, `Monoid`, `Selective`, `MonadFix`,
    `MonadZip`.

  * Documentation improvements.

  * Added dependency on `selective`.

  * Removed unnecessary test dependencies.

  # 0.5

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE. `element` now returns `[Node]`.
    This makes the library safer. It's not possible to construct a
    malformed `Element` anymore using the names exported by the library.
    It is also ergonomic, since most functions with which you would want
    to use a manually constructed `Element` expect a `[Node]` anyway.

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE. `element'` now returns
    `Either String Node`.

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE. `text` now returns `[Node]`.

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE. Removed `IsString Node` instance.

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE. Use lazy `Text` inside `Text`
    nodes. This improves `Text` concatenation performance, performed
    internally by `Xmlbf`, and makes more intelligent use of memory when
    dealing with long texts.

  * COMPILER ASSISTED BREAKING CHANGE. Removed `pRead`. You are encouraged
    to use `pFail` or `mzero` if you want to write a failing parser.

  * BREAKING CHANGE. `pText` now skips empty text nodes.

  * Added `node`.

  * Added `pFail`.

  * Added `text'`.

  * Added `pChildren`.

  * Added `pAnyElement`.

  * Added `pName`.

  * Added `NFData` instance for `Node`.

  * `encode` doesn't render self-closing tags anymore. Instead, each element has
    its corresponding closing tag.


  # 0.4.1

  * Generalized type of `pRead`.


  # 0.4

  * BREAKING CHANGE. `pElement` now skips leading whitespace before an element.

  * Fixed nested element parsing (#6)


  # 0.3

  * BREAKING CHANGE. Renamed `df` and `dfM` to `dfpos` and `dfposM` respectively.

  * Added `dfpre` and `dfpreM`.

  * Improved `Show` instance for `Node`.

  * Added `element'`.


  # 0.2

  * `Text` constructor hidden in favor of a `text` function plus a `Text` pattern
    synonym, just like with `element` and `Element`.

  * Documentation: Render `Element` pattern synonym.


  # 0.1

  * First version.

  # xmlbf

  _XML back and forth!_

  `xmlbf` provides `FromXML` and `ToXML` instances intended to be used as the
  familiar `FromJSON` and `ToJSON` from the `aeson` package.

  Build by running `nix-build` in the top-level directory. Alternatively, running
  `nix-shell` in the top-level directory puts you in a shell where all of the
  dependencies of this project are available. There you can use `cabal` and/or
  `./Setup.hs` as usual.
