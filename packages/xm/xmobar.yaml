  #139]: https://github.com/jaor/xmobar/issues/133\n\n## Version 0.19 (October 27,
  2013)\n\nAs of this release, the old bug tracker at Google code is deprecated.\nPlease
  use [Github's tracker] for new bugs.\n\n_New features_\n\n  - New monitor `BatteryN`,
  a variant of `BatteryP` that lets you\n    specify the name of the monitor in the
  template.\n  - Support for configuration file living in `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (see\n
  \   [github #99]).\n  - `Com` uses safer `runInteractiveProcess` instead of spawning
  a\n    shell (David McLean).  If you're using shell expansion in your\n    `Com`
  (e.g. \"~/bin/script\") here's a workaround: `Run Com\n    \"/bin/bash\" [\"-c\",
  \"~/bin/script\"]` (cf. [github #127]).\n  - New plugin `UnsafeStdinReader` that
  allows actions from stdin.\n    Now it's possible to have clickable workspaces!\n
  \   (Thiago Negri, see [github #125]).\n  - New monitor configuration option (`-x`
  or `--nastring`) that allows\n    specifying what string to display when a monitor
  is not available\n    (defaulting to \"N/A\"). Cf. [github #119].\n\n_Bug fixes_\n\n
  \ - Using the width options `-w`, `-m` and `-M` in battery monitors\n    watts display
  ([github #118]).\n  - Using the `-d` option in `CoreTemp` ([github #115])\n  - Fix
  for systems not supporting PCRE regular expressions: we use\n    now BCEs, so regex-compat
  should be enough everywhere (see\n    [github #117]).\n  - Weather monitor: support
  for stations without name (Sergei\n    Trofimovich, [issue #65]).\n\n[Github's tracker]:

  features_\n\n  - All extra argument monitors taking a string (e.g. `-O` for\n    `BatteryP`)
  accept now template variables (see [github #109] and\n    [#110]).  Thanks to Todd
  Lunter.\n\n  - New battery monitor extra argument, `-i`, for the idle status.\n\n_Bug
  fixes_\n\n  - Safer standard input parsing, avoiding <action> injections.\n\n\n[github
  #109]: https://github.com/jaor/xmobar/issues/109\n[#110]: https://github.com/jaor/xmobar/issues/110\n\n##
  Version 0.17 (May 5, 2013)\n\n_New features_\n\n  - Icons support: it's now possible
  to insert bitmaps in the template\n    (Edward O'Callaghan, Alexander Polakov and
  Tomáš Janoušek).\n  - Initial support for reacting to mouse clicks (Alexander Polakov).\n
  \ - New `TopP` and `BottomP` alignments, taking left and right\n    paddings (thanks
  to Dmitry Malikov).\n  - New `<freeratio>` field for memory monitor (Peter Simons).\n
  \ - New `allDesktops` and `overrideRedirect` configuration options,\n    providing
  dock behaviour in tiling WMs (when set to True and False\n    respectively). Cf.
  discussion at [github #105].\n  - Experimental `-d` (start as a dock) option, may
  address [github #67]\n    in some window managers.\n\n_Bug fixes_\n\n  - Partial
  (as reports go) fix for [github #77].\n  - Safer volume plugin (Dmitry Malikov).\n
  \ - Battery percentage capped at 100% (RJ Regenold).\n\n[github #67]: https://github.com/jaor/xmobar/issues/67\n[github

  Version 0.16 (Dec 3, 2012)\n\n_New features_\n\n  - New monitor `AutoMPD`, which
  uses asynchronous events to display\n    MPD status (thanks to Ben Boeckel).\n  -
  New monitor `BufferedPipeReader` displaying data from multiple\n    pipes (thanks
  to Jochen Keil).\n  - New monitor `DynNetwork`, which detects the active interface\n
  \   automatically, by Reto Hablützel\n  - New monitor, `Locks`, displaying the status
  of lock keys, by\n    Patrick Chilton.\n  - Extension for DBUS signal handling (Jochen
  Keil)\n  - Hide/Reveal: one can send signals to xmobar and make it (un)hide\n    itself
  (Jochen again).\n  - `PipeReader`'s default text is now configurable, by Reto Hablützel.\n
  \ - Dependencies updated to latest mtl and libmpd (thanks to Sergei\n    Trofimovich).\n
  \ - Dependencies on the deprecated dbus-core removed in favour of\n    dbus 0.10
  (thanks to Jochen Keil).\n  - MPris2 now includes genre and composer among its fields.\n\n_Bug
  fixes_\n\n  - `DiskIO` now can report overall activity in all partitions of a device\n
  \   which is not mounted itself (e.g., sda when sda1, sda3, etc. are\n    the mounted
  partitions).  Thanks to John Soros. See [github #73].\n  - `DiskU`, the disk usage
  monitor, works again correctly on Linux,\n    instead of randomly crashing every
  now and then, and reporting\n    wrong used size.\n  - When using antialiased fonts,
  we were causing a memory leak in the\n    X server by repeatedly allocating colors
  that, apparently, the\n    server doesn't know how to get rid of (even when told
  so!).  We're\n    caching them now and X server memory doesn't grow.\n  - Compilation
  errors and warnings with GHC 7.6 removed (thanks to\n    Raghavendra D Prabhu for
  his reports in [github #71]).\n\n_Known problems_\n\nSome users have reported problems
  with xmobar compiled with GHC 7.6 in\nArchLinux: see [github #78] and pointers therein.
  \ Please, send\nreports of any problems or successes in that regard so that we can
  fix\nany remaining issues.  Thanks!\n\n[github #71]: https://github.com/jaor/xmobar/issues/71\n[github
  #73]: https://github.com/jaor/xmobar/issues/73\n[github #78]: https://github.com/jaor/xmobar/issues/78\n\n##
  Version 0.15 (June 4, 2012)\n\n_Incompatible changes_\n\n  - `Batt` monitor no longer
  uses `-c` to specify the charge file: it\n    should figure things out by itself
  (cf. [issue 69]).\n\n_New features_\n\n  - New command line option, `-C`, that allows
  *adding* commands to\n    those specified in the configuration file (Ben Boeckel).\n
  \ - Dependency on GHC's threaded runtime has been eliminated.\n  - New MPRIS (versions
  1 and 2) monitor, by Artem Tarasov.\n  - New monitor option `-d` to specify the
  number of decimal places to\n    display for float numbers.  Defaults to 0. See
  [issue 58].\n  - New compilation option `--with_threaded`, to use GHC's threaded\n
  \   runtime to compile xmobar.  Disabled by default (cf. discussion in\n    [github
  #36]).\n\n_Bug fixes_\n\n  - Stricter build dependencies versioning in cabal file.\n
  \ - [issue 56] vertical alignment of text improved.\n  - [issue 64] display of `watts`
  in `Batt` monitor fixed.\n  - [issue 69] miscellaneous battery reporting issues.\n
  \ - [issue 67] compilation in DragonFly.\n  - DiskIO works also when device path
  in mtab are symbolic links\n    to the real device file.\n  - Wireless monitor honours
  padding settings for ESSID names.\n  - CoreTemp monitor fixed for newer kernels
  ([github #38]).\n\n[issue 56]: http://code.google.com/p/xmobar/issues/detail?id=56\n[issue

  \ - xmobar app new has WM_CLASS, WM_NAME and _NET_WM_PID xprops\n    ([issue 38]).\n\n_Incompatible
  changes_\n\n  - In the process of solving [issue 14], we've broken those\n    configurations
  that rely on including alignment separators in the\n    input fed to `StdinReader`.\n
  \ - The MPD plugin does not accept host and port options anymore: use\n    the environment
  variables MPD_HOST and MPD_PORT instead.\n  - The `Mail` plugin now takes a second
  parameter (a string)\n    specifying its alias. As a side-effect, this solves [issue
  30].\n\n_Bug fixes_\n\n  - [issue 14] `StdinReader` and other plugins accepting
  external\n    input don't get confused anymore when characters from `alignSep`\n
  \   appear in their input.\n  - [issue 27] `BottomSize` placement now respects its
  width argument.\n  - [issue 28] Compilation in Mac OS X fixed.\n  - [issue 30] `Mail`
  plugin can be specified anywhere in commands list.\n  - [issue 36] Battery monitor
  now supports non-standard locations of\n    the `/sys/class/power_supply/AC/online`
  file.\n  - [issue 40] Battery monitor now supports the new power_now, that\n    replaces
  current_now in linux kernels for v. 2.36 and above.\n  - [issue 42] More accurate
  net monitor rates.\n  - DiskIO, Cpu and MultiCpu monitors are also more accurate
  now.\n  - Text is now correctly centered vertically.\n  - `FullBM` border spec fixed.\n\n[issue

description: ! "[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/xmobar.svg)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmobar)\n[![Build
  Status](https://travis-ci.org/jaor/xmobar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jaor/xmobar)\n\n#
  About\n\nxmobar is a minimalistic, mostly text based, status bar. It was\noriginally
  designed and implemented by Andrea Rossato to work with\n[xmonad], but it's actually
  usable with any window-manager.\n\nxmobar was inspired by the [Ion3] status bar,
  and supports similar\nfeatures, like dynamic color management, icons, output templates,
  and\nextensibility through plugins.\n\n[This screenshot] shows xmobar running under
  [sawfish], with\nantialiased fonts. And [this one] is my desktop with [xmonad] and
  two\ninstances of xmobar.\n\n[xmonad]: http://xmonad.org\n[Ion3]: http://tuomov.iki.fi/software/\n[This
  screenshot]: http://projects.haskell.org/xmobar/xmobar-sawfish.png\n[this one]:
  http://projects.haskell.org/xmobar/xmobar-xmonad.png\n\n# Bug Reports\n\nTo submit
  bug reports you can use the [bug tracker over at Github].\n\nNote: the old bug tracker
  at Google code is deprecated.  Please use\nGithub's for new bugs.\n\n[bug tracker
  over at Github]: https://github.com/jaor/xmobar/issues\n\n# Installation\n\n## Using
  cabal-install\n\nXmobar is available from [Hackage], and you can install it using\n`cabal-install`:\n\n
  \       cabal install xmobar\n\nSee below for a list of optional compilation flags
  that will enable\nsome optional plugins. For instance, to install xmobar with all
  the\nbells and whistles, use:\n\n        cabal install xmobar --flags=\"all_extensions\"\n\n##
  From source\n\nIf you don't have `cabal-install` installed, you can get xmobar's\nsource
  code in a variety of ways:\n\n  - From [Hackage]. Just download the latest release
  from xmobar's\n    hackage page.\n  - From [Github]. You can also obtain a tarball
  in [Github's\n    downloads page]. You'll find there links to each tagged release.\n
  \ - From the bleeding edge repo. If you prefer to live dangerously,\n    just get
  the latest and greatest (and buggiest, I guess) using\n    git:\n\n        git clone
  git://github.com/jaor/xmobar\n\n\n[Github's downloads page]: https://github.com/jaor/xmobar/downloads\n\nIf
  you have cabal installed, you can now use it from within xmobar's\nsource tree:\n\n
  \       cabal install -fall_extensions\n\n\nThere is also a barebones `stack.yaml`
  file that will allow you to\nbuild the xmobar executable with stances of the form:\n\n
  \       stack build --flag xmobar:all_extensions\n\n\n## Optional features\n\nYou
  can configure xmobar to include some optional plugins and\nfeatures, which are not
  compiled by default. To that end, you need to\nadd one or more flags to either the
  cabal install command or the\nconfigure setup step, as shown in the examples above.\n\nExtensions
  need additional libraries (listed below) that will be\nautomatically downloaded
  and installed if you're using cabal install.\nOtherwise, you'll need to install
  them yourself.\n\n- `with_dbus` Enables support for DBUS by making xmobar to publish
  a\n  service on the session bus.  Requires the [dbus] package.\n\n- `with_threaded`
  Uses GHC's threaded runtime.  Use this option if\n  xmobar enters a high-CPU regime
  right after starting.\n\n- `with_utf8` UTF-8 support. Requires the [utf8-string]
  package.\n\n- `with_xft` Antialiased fonts. Requires the [X11-xft] package. This\n
  \ option automatically enables UTF-8.  To use XFT fonts you need to\n  use the `xft:`
  prefix in the `font` configuration option. For\n  instance:\n\n        font = \"xft:Times
  New Roman-10:italic\"\n\n  Or to have fallback fonts, just separate them by commas:\n\n
  \       font = \"xft:Open Sans:size=9,WenQuanYi Zen Hei:size=9\"\n\n- `with_mpd`
  Enables support for the [MPD] daemon. Requires the\n  [libmpd] package.\n\n- `with_mpris`
  Enables support for MPRIS v1/v2 protocol.  Requires the\n  [dbus] and [text] packages.\n\n-
  `with_inotify` Support for inotify in modern Linux kernels. This\n  option is needed
  for the MBox and Mail plugins to work. Requires the\n  [hinotify] package.\n\n-
  `with_iwlib` Support for wireless cards. Enables the Wireless\n   plugin. No Haskell
  library is required, but you will need the\n   [iwlib] C library and headers in
  your system (e.g., install\n   `libiw-dev` in Debian-based systems or `wireless_tools`
  on Arch\n   Linux).\n\n- `with_alsa` Support for ALSA sound cards. Enables the Volume\n
  \  plugin. Requires the [alsa-mixer] package.  To install the latter,\n   you'll
  need the [libasound] C library and headers in your system\n   (e.g., install `libasound2-dev`
  in Debian-based systems).\n\n- `with_datezone` Support for other timezones. Enables
  the DateZone\n   plugin.  Requires [timezone-olson] and [timezone-series] package.\n\n-
  `with_xpm` Support for xpm image file format. This will allow loading\n  .xpm files
  in `<icon>`.  Requires the [libXpm] C library.\n\n- `with_uvmeter` Enables UVMeter
  plugin. The plugin shows UV data for\n   Australia. Requires `with_conduit` to connect
  to HTTPS URLs.\n\n- `with_weather` Support to display weather information. Enables\n
  \  Weather plugin.\n\n- `with_conduit` Use http-conduit for getting weather data
  enabling\n  support for http proxies.  Requires [http-conduit] and [http-types].\n
  \ Note that this flag has only an effect if `with_weather` is also set.\n\n- `all_extensions`
  Enables all the extensions above.\n\n# Running xmobar\n\nYou can now run xmobar
  with:\n\n        xmobar /path/to/config &\n\nor\n\n        xmobar &\n\nif you have
  the default configuration file saved as\n`$XDG\\_CONFIG\\_HOME/xmobar/xmobarrc`
  (defaulting to\n`~/.config/xmobar/xmobarrc`), or `~/.xmobarrc`.\n\n## Signal Handling\n\nSince
  0.14 xmobar reacts to SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2:\n\n- After receiving SIGUSR1 xmobar moves
  its position to the next screen.\n\n- After receiving SIGUSR2 xmobar repositions
  itself on the current screen.\n\n# Configuration\n\n## Quick Start\n\nSee [samples/xmobar.config]
  for an example.\n\n[samples/xmobar.config]: http://github.com/jaor/xmobar/raw/master/samples/xmobar.config\n\nFor
  the output template:\n\n- `%command%` will execute command and print the output.
  The output\n  may contain markups to change the characters' color.\n\n- `<fc=#FF0000>string</fc>`
  will print `string` with `#FF0000` color\n  (red).\n\n- `<fn=1>string</fn>` will
  print `string` with the first font from\n  `additionalFonts`.  The index `0` corresponds
  to the standard font.\n\n- `<icon=/path/to/icon.xbm/>` will insert the given bitmap.
  XPM image\n  format is also supported when compiled with `--flags=\"with_xpm\"`.\n\n-
  ```<action=`command` button=12345>``` will execute given command\n  when clicked
  with specified buttons. If not specified, button is\n  equal to 1 (left mouse button).
  Using old syntax (without backticks\n  surrounding `command`) will result in `button`
  attribute being\n  ignored.\n\n- `<raw=len:str/>` allows the encapsulation of arbitrary
  text `str` (which\n  must be `len` `Char`s long, where `len` is encoded as a decimal
  sequence).\n  Careful use of this and `UnsafeStdinReader`, for example, permits
  window\n  managers to feed xmobar strings with `<action>` tags mixed with un-trusted\n
  \ content (e.g. window titles).  For example, if xmobar is invoked as\n\n    ```xmobar
  -c \"[Run UnsafeStdinReader]\" -t \"%UnsafeStdinReader%\"```\n\n  and receives on
  standard input the line\n\n    ```<action=`echo test` button=1><raw=41:<action=`echo
  mooo` button=1>foo</action>/></action>```\n\n  then it will display the text ```<action=`echo
  mooo` button=1>foo</action>```,\n  which, when clicked, will cause `test` to be
  echoed.\n\nOther configuration options:\n\n- `font` Name of the font to be used.
  Use the `xft:` prefix for XFT\n  fonts.\n\n- `additionalFonts` Haskell-style list
  of fonts to be used with the\n  `fn`-template.  Use the `xft:` prefix for XFT fonts.
  \ See also\n  `textOffsets` below.\n\n- `bgColor` Background color.\n\n- `fgColor`
  Default font color.\n\n- `alpha` The transparency.  0 is transparent, 255 is opaque.\n\n-
  `position` Top, TopP, TopW, TopSize, Bottom, BottomP, BottomW,\n  BottomSize or
  Static (with x, y, width and height).\n\n  TopP and BottomP take 2 arguments: left
  padding and right padding.\n\n  TopW and BottomW take 2 arguments: an alignment
  parameter (L for\n  left, C for centered, R for Right) and an integer for the percentage\n
  \ width xmobar window will have in respect to the screen width.\n\n  TopSize and
  BottomSize take 3 arguments: an alignment parameter, an\n  integer for the percentage
  width, and an integer for the minimum\n  pixel height that the xmobar window will
  have.\n\n  For example:\n\n          position = BottomW C 75\n\n  to place xmobar
  at the bottom, centered with the 75% of the screen\n  width.  Or\n\n          position
  = BottomP 120 0\n\n  to place xmobar at the bottom, with 120 pixel indent of the
  left.\n  Or\n\n          position = Static { xpos = 0 , ypos = 0, width = 1024,
  height = 15 }\n\n  or\n\n          position = Top\n\n- `textOffset` The vertical
  offset, in pixels, for the text baseline.\n   If negative or not given, xmobar will
  try to center text\n   vertically.\n\n- `textOffsets` A list of vertical offsets,
  in pixels, for the text\n   baseline, to be used with the each of the fonts in\n
  \  `additionalFonts` (if any).  If negative or not given, xmobar will\n   try to
  center text vertically for that font.\n\n- `iconOffset` The vertical offset, in
  pixels, for icons bottom line.\n   If negative or not given, xmobar will try to
  center icons\n   vertically.\n\n- `lowerOnStart` When True the window is sent the
  bottom of the window\n  stack initially.\n\n- `hideOnStart` When set to True the
  window is initially not mapped,\n  i.e. hidden. It then can be toggled manually
  (for example using the\n  dbus interface) or automatically (by a plugin) to make
  it reappear.\n\n- `allDesktops` When set to True (the default), xmobar will tell
  the\n  window manager explicitly to be shown in all desktops, by setting\n  `_NET_WM_DESKTOP`
  to 0xffffffff.\n\n- `overrideRedirect` If you're running xmobar in a tiling window\n
  \ manager, you might need to set this option to `False` so that it\n  behaves as
  a docked application.  Defaults to `True`.\n\n- `pickBroadest` When multiple displays
  are available, xmobar will\n  choose by default the first one to place itself.  With
  this flag set\n  to `True` (the default is `False`) it will choose the broadest
  one\n  instead.\n\n- `persistent` When True the window status is fixed i.e. hiding
  or\n  revealing is not possible. This option can be toggled at\n  runtime. Defaults
  to False.\n\n- `border` TopB, TopBM, BottomB, BottomBM, FullB, FullBM or NoBorder\n
  \ (default).\n\n  TopB, BottomB, FullB take no arguments, and request drawing a
  border\n  at the top, bottom or around xmobar's window, respectively.\n\n  TopBM,
  BottomBM, FullBM take an integer argument, which is the\n  margin, in pixels, between
  the border of the window and the drawn\n  border.\n\n- `borderColor` Border color.\n\n-
  `borderWidth` Border width in pixels.\n\n- `iconRoot` Root folder where icons are
  stored. For <icon=path/> if\n  path start with `\"/\"`, `\"./\"` or `\"../\"` it
  is interpreted as it is.\n  Otherwise it will have `iconRoot ++ \"/\"` prepended
  to it. Default is\n  `\".\"`.\n\n- `commands` For setting the options of the programs
  to run\n  (optional).\n\n- `sepChar` The character to be used for indicating commands
  in the\n  output template (default '%').\n\n- `alignSep` a 2 character string for
  aligning text in the output\n  template. The text before the first character will
  be align to left,\n  the text in between the 2 characters will be centered, and
  the text\n  after the second character will be align to the right.\n\n- `template`
  The output template.\n\n\n- `wmClass` The value for the window's X11 WM_CLASS property.\n
  \ Defaults to \"xmobar\".\n\n- `wmName` The value for the window's X11 WM_NAME property.
  \ Defaults\n  to \"xmobar\".\n\n### Running xmobar with i3status\n\nxmobar can be
  used to display information generated by [i3status], a\nsmall program that gathers
  system information and outputs it in\nformats suitable for being displayed by the
  dzen2 status bar, wmii's\nstatus bar or xmobar's `StdinReader`.  See [i3status manual]
  for\nfurther details.\n\n## Command Line Options\n\nxmobar can be either configured
  with a configuration file or with\ncommand line options. In the second case, the
  command line options\nwill overwrite the corresponding options set in the configuration\nfile.\n\nExample:\n\n
  \   xmobar -B white -a right -F blue -t '%LIPB%' -c '[Run Weather \"LIPB\" [] 36000]'\n\nThis
  is the list of command line options (the output of\nxmobar --help):\n\n    Usage:
  xmobar [OPTION...] [FILE]\n    Options:\n      -h, -?        --help                 This

  bug reports and suggestions to <xmobar@projects.haskell.org>\n\n## The DBus Interface\n\nWhen
  compiled with the optional `with_dbus` flag, xmobar can be\ncontrolled over dbus.
  All signals defined in [src/Signal.hs] as `data\nSignalType` can now be sent over
  dbus to xmobar.  Due to current\nlimitations of the implementation only one process
  of xmobar can\nacquire the dbus. This is handled on a first-come-first-served basis,\nmeaning
  that the first process will get the dbus interface. Other\nprocesses will run without
  further problems, yet have no dbus\ninterface.\n\n[src/Signal.hs]: https://github.com/jaor/xmobar/raw/master/src/Signal.hs\n\n-
  Bus Name: `org.Xmobar.Control`\n- Object Path: `/org/Xmobar/Control`\n- Member Name:
  Any of SignalType, e.g. `string:Reveal`\n- Interface Name: `org.Xmobar.Control`\n\nAn
  example using the `dbus-send` command line utility:\n\n        dbus-send \\\n            --session
  \\\n            --dest=org.Xmobar.Control \\\n            --type=method_call \\\n

  w  = ev_window e\n              et = ev_event_type e\n\n\n## The Output Template\n\nThe
  output template must contain at least one command. xmobar will\nparse the template
  and will search for the command to be executed in\nthe `commands` configuration
  option. First an `alias` will be searched\n(plugins such as Weather or Network have
  default aliases, see below).\nAfter that, the command name will be tried. If a command
  is found, the\narguments specified in the `commands` list will be used.\n\nIf no
  command is found in the `commands` list, xmobar will ask the\noperating system to
  execute a program with the name found in the\ntemplate. If the execution is not
  successful an error will be\nreported.\n\nIt's possible to insert in the global
  templates icon directives of the\nform:\n\n     <icon=/path/to/bitmap.xbm/>\n\nwhich
  will produce the expected result. Accepted image formats are XBM\nand XPM (when
  `with_xpm` flag is enabled). If path does not start with\n`\"/\"`, `\"./\"`, `\"../\"`
  it will have `iconRoot ++ \"/\"` prepended to it.\n\nIt's also possible to use action
  directives of the form:\n\n     <action=`command` button=12345>\n\nwhich will be
  executed when clicked on with specified mouse buttons. This tag\ncan be nested,
  allowing different commands to be run depending on button clicked.\n\n## The `commands`
  Configuration Option\n\nThe `commands` configuration option is a list of commands
  information\nand arguments to be used by xmobar when parsing the output template.\nEach
  member of the list consists in a command prefixed by the `Run`\nkeyword. Each command
  has arguments to control the way xmobar is going\nto execute it.\n\nThe option consists
  in a list of commands separated by a comma and\nenclosed by square parenthesis.\n\nExample:\n\n
  \   [Run Memory [\"-t\",\"Mem: <usedratio>%\"] 10, Run Swap [] 10]\n\nto run the
  Memory monitor plugin with the specified template, and the\nswap monitor plugin,
  with default options, every second.  And here's\nan example of a template for the
  commands above using an icon:\n\n    template=\"<icon=/home/jao/.xmobar/mem.xbm/><memory>
  <swap>\"\n\nThis example will run \"xclock\" command when date is clicked:\n\n    template=\"<action=`xclock`>%date%</action>\n\nThe
  only internal available command is `Com` (see below Executing\nExternal Commands).
  All other commands are provided by plugins. xmobar\ncomes with some plugins, providing
  a set of system monitors, a\nstandard input reader, an Unix named pipe reader, a
  configurable date\nplugin, and much more: we list all available plugins below.\n\nOther
  commands can be created as plugins with the Plugin\ninfrastructure. See below.\n\n##
  System Monitor Plugins\n\nThis is the description of the system monitor plugins
  available in\nxmobar.  Some of them are only installed when an optional build option\nis
  set: we mention that fact, when needed, in their description.\n\nEach monitor has
  an `alias` to be used in the output template.\nMonitors have default aliases.  The
  sections below describe every\nmonitor in turn, but before we provide a list of
  the configuration\noptions (or *monitor arguments*) they all share.\n\n### Icon
  patterns\n\nSome monitors allow usage of strings that depend on some integer value\nfrom
  0 to 8 by replacing all occurrences of `\"%%\"` with it\n(i.e. `\"<icon=/path/to/icon_%%.xpm/>\"`
  will be interpreted\nas `\"<icon=/path/to/icon_3.xpm/>\"` when the value is `3`,
  also `\"%\"` is interpreted\nas `\"%\"`, `\"%%\"` as `\"3\"`, `\"%%%\"` as `\"3%\"`,
  `\"%%%%\"` as `\"33\"` and so on). Essentially\nit allows to replace vertical bars
  with custom icons. For example,\n\n    Run Brightness\n      [ \"-t\", \"<ipat>\"\n
  \     , \"--\"\n      , \"--brightness-icon-pattern\", \"<icon=bright_%%.xpm/>\"\n
  \     ] 30\n\nWill display `bright_0.xpm` to `bright_8.xpm` depending on current
  brightness\nvalue.\n\n### Default Monitor Arguments\n\nMonitors accept a common
  set of arguments, described in the first\nsubsection below.  In addition, some monitors
  accept additional options\nthat are specific to them.  When specifying the list
  of arguments in\nyour configuration, the common options come first, followed by
  \"--\",\nfollowed by any monitor-specific options.\n\nThese are the options available
  for all monitors below:\n\n- `-t` _string_  Output template\n    - Template for
  the monitor output. Field names must be enclosed\n      between pointy brackets
  (`<foo>`) and will be substituted by the\n      computed values. You can also specify
  the foreground (and\n      optionally, background) color for a region by bracketing
  it\n      between `<fc=fgcolor>` (or `<fc=fgcolor,bgcolor>`) and\n      `</fc>`.
  The rest of the template is output verbatim.\n    - Long option: `--template`\n
  \   - Default value: per monitor (see above).\n- `-H` _number_ The high threshold.\n
  \   - Numerical values higher than _number_ will be displayed with the\n      color
  specified by `-h` (see below).\n    - Long option: `--High`\n    - Default value:
  66\n- `-L` _number_ The low threshold.\n    - Numerical values higher than _number_
  and lower than the high\n      threshold will be displayed with the color specified
  by `-n`\n      (see below). Values lower than _number_ will use the `-l` color.\n
  \   - Long option: `--Low`\n    - Default value: 33\n- `-h` _color_  High threshold
  color.\n    - Color for displaying values above the high threshold. _color_ can\n
  \     be either a name (e.g. \"blue\") or an hexadecimal RGB (e.g.\n      \"#FF0000\").\n
  \   - Long option: `--high`\n    - Default: none (use the default foreground).\n-
  `-n` _color_  Color for 'normal' values\n    - Color used for values greater than
  the low threshold but lower\n      than the high one.\n    - Long option: `--normal`\n
  \   - Default: none (use the default foreground).\n- `-l` _color_  The low threshold
  color\n    - Color for displaying values below the low threshold.\n    - Long option:
  `--low`\n    - Default: none (use the default foreground).\n- `-S` _boolean_ Display
  optional suffixes\n    - When set to a true designator (\"True\", \"Yes\" or \"On\"),
  optional\n      value suffixes such as the '%' symbol or optional units will be\n
  \     displayed.\n    - Long option: `--suffix`\n    - Default: False.\n- `-p` _number_
  Percentages padding\n    - Width, in number of digits, for quantities representing\n
  \     percentages. For instance `-p 3` means that all percentages\n      in the
  monitor will be represented using 3 digits.\n    - Long option: `--ppad`\n    -
  Default value: 0 (don't pad)\n- `-d` _number_ Decimal digits\n    - Number of digits
  after the decimal period to use in float values.\n    - Long option: `--ddigits`\n
  \   - Default value: 0 (display only integer part)\n- `-m` _number_ Minimum field
  width\n    - Minimum width, in number of characters, of the fields in the\n      monitor
  template. Values whose printed representation is shorter\n      than this value
  will be padded using the padding characters\n      given by the `-c` option with
  the alignment specified by `-a`\n      (see below).\n    - Long option: `--minwidth`\n
  \   - Default: 0\n- `-M` _number_ Maximum field width\n    - Maximum width, in number
  of characters, of the fields in the\n      monitor template. Values whose printed
  representation is longer\n      than this value will be truncated.\n    - Long option:
  `--maxwidth`\n    - Default: 0 (no maximum width)\n- `-e` _string_ Maximum width
  ellipsis\n    - Ellipsis to be added to the field when it has reached its\n      max
  width.\n    - Long option: `--maxwidthellipsis`\n    - Default: \"\" (no ellipsis)\n-
  `-w` _number_ Fixed field width\n    - All fields will be set to this width, padding
  or truncating as\n      needed.\n    - Long option: `--width`\n    - Default: 0
  (variable width)\n- `-T` _number_ Maximum total width\n    - Maximum total width
  of the text.\n    - Long option: `--maxtwidth`\n    - Default: 0 (no limit)\n- `-E`
  _string_ Maximum total width ellipsis\n    - Ellipsis to be added to the total text
  when it has reached\n      its max width.\n    - Long option: `--maxtwidthellipsis`\n
  \   - Default: \"\" (no ellipsis)\n- `-c` _string_\n    - Characters used for padding.
  The characters of _string_ are used\n      cyclically. E.g., with `-P +- -w 6`,
  a field with value \"foo\"\n      will be represented as \"+-+foo\".\n    - Long
  option: `--padchars`\n    - Default value: \" \"\n- `-a` r|l Field alignment\n    -
  Whether to use right (r) or left (l) alignment of field values\n      when padding.\n
  \   - Long option: `--align`\n    - Default value: r (padding to the left)\n- `-b`
  _string_ Bar background\n    - Characters used, cyclically, to draw the background
  of bars.\n      For instance, if you set this option to \"·.\", an empty bar will\n
  \     look like this: `·.·.·.·.·.`\n    - Long option: `--bback`\n    - Default
  value: \":\"\n- `-f` _string_ Bar foreground\n    - Characters used, cyclically,
  to draw the foreground of bars.\n    - Long option: `--bfore`\n    - Default value:
  \"#\"\n- `-W` _number_ Bar width\n    - Total number of characters used to draw
  bars.\n    - Long option: `--bwidth`\n    - Default value: 10\n- `-x` _string_ N/A
  string\n    - String to be used when the monitor is not available\n    - Long option:
  `--nastring`\n    - Default value: \"N/A\"\n\nCommands' arguments must be set as
  a list. E.g.:\n\n    Run Weather \"EGPF\" [\"-t\", \"<station>: <tempC>C\"] 36000\n\nIn
  this case xmobar will run the weather monitor, getting information\nfor the weather
  station ID EGPF (Glasgow Airport, as a homage to GHC)\nevery hour (36000 tenth of
  seconds), with a template that will output\nsomething like:\n\n    Glasgow Airport:
  16.0C\n\n\n### `Uptime Args RefreshRate`\n\n- Aliases to `uptime`\n- Args: default

  the above example, the thresholds before the \"--\" separator\n  affect only the
  `<left>` and `<leftbar>` fields, while those after\n  the separator affect how `<watts>`
  is displayed. For this monitor,\n  neither the generic nor the specific options
  have any effect on\n  `<timeleft>`.\n\n  It is also possible to specify template
  variables in the `-O` and\n  `-o` switches, as in the following example:\n\n         Run
  BatteryP [\"BAT0\"]\n                      [\"-t\", \"<acstatus>\"\n                      ,
  \"-L\", \"10\", \"-H\", \"80\"\n                      , \"-l\", \"red\", \"-h\",
  \"green\"\n                      , \"--\", \"-O\", \"Charging\", \"-o\", \"Battery:
  <left>%\"\n                      ] 10\n\n- The \"idle\" AC state is selected whenever
  the AC power entering the\n  battery is zero.\n\n### `BatteryN Dirs Args RefreshRate
  Alias`\n\nWorks like `BatteryP`, but lets you specify an alias for the monitor\nother
  than \"battery\".  Useful in case you one separate monitors for\nmore than one battery.\n\n###
  `TopProc Args RefreshRate`\n\n- Aliases to `top`\n- Args: default monitor arguments.

  mail counts\n- Paths may start with a '~' to expand to the user's home directory.\n-
  This plugin requires inotify support in your Linux kernel and the\n  [hinotify]
  package. To activate, pass `--flags=\"with_inotify\"`\n  during compilation.\n-
  Example. The following command look for mails in `/var/mail/inbox`\n  and `~/foo/mbox`,
  and will put a space in front of the printed string\n  (when it's not empty); it
  can be used in the template with the alias\n  `mbox`:\n\n         Run MBox [(\"I
  \", \"inbox\", \"red\"), (\"O \", \"~/foo/mbox\", \"\")]\n                  [\"-d\",
  \"/var/mail/\", \"-p\", \" \"] \"mbox\"\n\n### `XPropertyLog PropName`\n\n- Aliases
  to `PropName`\n- Reads the X property named by `PropName` (a string) and displays
  its\n  value. The [samples/xmonadpropwrite.hs script] in xmobar's\n  distribution
  can be used to set the given property from the output\n  of any other program or
  script.\n\n[samples/xmonadpropwrite.hs script]: https://github.com/jaor/xmobar/raw/master/samples/xmonadpropwrite.hs\n\n###
  `UnsafeXPropertyLog PropName`\n\n- Aliases to `PropName`\n- Same as `XPropertyLog`,
  but the input is not filtered to avoid\n  injection of actions (cf. `UnsafeXMonadLog`).
  \ The program writing\n  the value of the read property is responsible of performing
  any\n  needed cleanups.\n\n### `NamedXPropertyLog PropName Alias`\n\n- Aliases to
  `Alias`\n- Same as `XPropertyLog`, but a custom alias can be specified.\n\n### `NamedXPropertyLog
  PropName Alias`\n\n- Aliases to `Alias`\n- Same as `UnsafeXPropertyLog`, but a custom
  alias can be specified.\n\n### `Brightness Args RefreshRate`\n\n- Aliases to `bright`\n-
  Args: default monitor arguments, plus the following specif ones:\n    - `-D`: directory

  \   - `-C`: file with the current brightness (default:\n       actual_brightness)\n
  \   - `-M`: file with the maximum brightness (default:\n       max_brightness)\n
  \   - `--brightness-icon-pattern`: dynamic string for current brightness in `ipat`.\n-
  Variables that can be used with the `-t`/`--template` argument:\n\t    `vbar`, `percent`,
  `bar`, `ipat`\n- Default template: `<percent>`\n- Example:\n\n       Run Brightness
  [\"-t\", \"<bar>\"] 60\n\n### `Kbd Opts`\n\n- Registers to XKB/X11-Events and output
  the currently active keyboard layout.\n  Supports replacement of layout names.\n-
  Aliases to `kbd`\n- Opts is a list of tuples:\n    -  first element of the tuple

  Example:\n\n\t\tRun Kbd [(\"us(dvorak)\", \"DV\"), (\"us\", \"US\")]\n\n### `Locks`\n\n-
  Displays the status of Caps Lock, Num Lock and Scroll Lock.\n- Aliases to `locks`\n-
  Example:\n\n\tRun Locks\n\n### `CatInt n filename`\n\n- Reads and displays an integer
  from the file whose path is `filename`\n  (especially useful with files in `/sys`).\n-
  Aliases as `catn` (e.g. `Cat 0` as `cat0`, etc.) so you can\n  have several.\n-
  Example:\n\n    Run CatInt 0 \"/sys/devices/platform/thinkpad_hwmon/fan1_input\"
  [] 50\n\n### `UVMeter`\n\n- Aliases to \"uv \" + station id. For example: `%uv brisbane%`
  or `%uv\n  alice springs%`\n- Args: default monitor arguments.\n\n- *Reminder:*
  Keep the refresh rate high, to avoid making unnecessary\n  requests every time the
  plug-in is run.\n- Station IDs can be found here:\n  http://www.arpansa.gov.au/uvindex/realtime/xml/uvvalues.xml\n-
  Example:\n\n        Run UVMeter \"brisbane\" [\"-H\", \"3\", \"-L\", \"3\", \"--low\",
  \"green\", \"--high\", \"red\"] 900\n\n## Executing External Commands\n\nIn order
  to execute an external command you can either write the\ncommand name in the template,
  in this case it will be executed without\narguments, or you can configure it in
  the \"commands\" configuration\noption list with the Com template command:\n\n`Com
  ProgramName Args Alias RefreshRate`\n\n- ProgramName: the name of the program\n-
  Args: the arguments to be passed to the program at execution time\n- RefreshRate:
  number of tenths of second between re-runs of the\n  command. A zero or negative
  rate means that the command will be\n  executed only once.\n- Alias: a name to be
  used in the template. If the alias is en empty\n  string the program name can be
  used in the template.\n\nE.g.:\n\n        Run Com \"uname\" [\"-s\",\"-r\"] \"\"
  0\n\ncan be used in the output template as `%uname%` (and xmobar will call\n_uname_
  only once), while\n\n        Run Com \"date\" [\"+\\\"%a %b %_d %H:%M\\\"\"] \"mydate\"
  600\n\ncan be used in the output template as `%mydate%`.\n\nSometimes, you don't
  mind if the command executed exits with an error,\nor you might want to display
  a custom message in that case.  To that\nend, you can use the `ComX` variant:\n\n`ComX
  ProgramName Args ExitMessage Alias RefreshRate`\n\nWorks like `Com`, but displaying
  `ExitMessage` (a string) if the\nexecution fails.  For instance:\n\n        Run
  ComX \"date\" [\"+\\\"%a %b %_d %H:%M\\\"\"] \"N/A\" \"mydate\" 600\n\nwill display
  \"N/A\" if for some reason the `date` invocation fails.\n\n## Other Plugins\n\n<font
  size=\"+1\">**`StdinReader`**</font>\n\n- Aliases to StdinReader\n- Displays any
  text received by xmobar on its standard input.\n- Strips actions from the text received.
  \ This means you can't pass dynamic\n  actions via stdin.  This is safer than `UnsafeStdinReader`
  because there is\n  no need to escape the content before passing it to xmobar's
  standard input.\n\n<font size=\"+1\">**`UnsafeStdinReader`**</font>\n\n- Aliases
  to UnsafeStdinReader\n- Displays any text received by xmobar on its standard input.\n-
  Will not do anything to the text received.  This means you can pass dynamic\n  actions
  via stdin.  Be careful to remove tags from dynamic text that you\n  pipe-thru to
  xmobar's standard input, e.g. window's title.  There is no way\n  to escape the
  tags, i.e. you can't print a literal `<action>` tag as a text\n  on xmobar.\n- Sample
  usage: send to xmobar's stdin the list of your workspaces enclosed by\n  actions
  tags that switches the workspaces to be able to switch workspaces by\n  clicking
  on xmobar:\n  ```<action=`xdotool key alt+1`>ws1</action> <action=`xdotool key alt+1`>ws2</action>```\n\n<font
  size=\"+1\">**`Date Format Alias RefreshRate`**</font>\n\n- Format is a time format
  string, as accepted by the standard ISO C\n  `strftime` function (or Haskell's `formatCalendarTime`).\n-
  Sample usage: `Run Date \"%a %b %_d %Y <fc=#ee9a00>%H:%M:%S</fc>\" \"date\" 10`\n\n<font
  size=\"+1\">**`DateZone Format Locale Zone Alias RefreshRate`**</font>\n\n- Format
  is a time format string, as accepted by the standard ISO C\n  `strftime` function
  (or Haskell's `formatCalendarTime`).\n- If Locale is \"\" the default locale of
  the system is used, otherwise the given\n  locale. If there are more instances of
  DateZone, using \"\" as input for Locale\n  is not recommended.\n- Zone is the name
  of the TimeZone. It is assumed that the tz database is stored\n  in /usr/share/zoneinfo/.
  If \"\" is given as Zone, the default system time is\n  used.\n- Sample usage:\n
  \ `Run DateZone \"%a %H:%M:%S\" \"de_DE.UTF-8\" \"Europe/Vienna\" \"viennaTime\"
  10`\n\n<font size=\"+1\">**`CommandReader \"/path/to/program\" Alias`**</font>\n\n-
  Runs the given program, and displays its standard output.\n\n<font size=\"+1\">**`PipeReader
  \"default text:/path/to/pipe\" Alias`**</font>\n\n- Reads its displayed output from
  the given pipe.\n- Prefix an optional default text separated by a colon\n- Expands
  environment variables in the first argument of syntax '${VAR}' or '$VAR'\n\n<font
  size=\"+1\">**`MarqueePipeReader \"default text:/path/to/pipe\" (length, rate, sep)
  Alias`**</font>\n\n- Generally equivalent to PipeReader\n- Text is displayed as
  marquee with the specified length, rate in 10th\n  seconds and separator when it
  wraps around\n\n        Run MarqueePipeReader \"/tmp/testpipe\" (10, 7, \"+\") \"mpipe\"\n\n-
  Expands environment variables in the first argument\n\n<font size=\"+1\">\n**`BufferedPipeReader
  Alias [(Timeout, Bool, \"/path/to/pipe1\"), ..]`**\n</font>\n\n- Display data from
  multiple pipes.\n- Timeout (in tenth of seconds) is the value after which the previous\n
  \ content is restored i.e. if there was already something from a\n  previous pipe
  it will be put on display again, overwriting the\n  current status.\n- A pipe with
  Timeout of 0 will be displayed permanently, just like\n  `PipeReader`\n- The boolean
  option indicates whether new data for this pipe should\n  make xmobar appear (unhide,
  reveal). In this case, the Timeout\n  additionally specifies when the window should
  be hidden again. The\n  output is restored in any case.\n- Use it for OSD-like status
  bars e.g. for setting the volume or\n  brightness:\n\n        Run BufferedPipeReader
  \"bpr\"\n            [ (  0, False, \"/tmp/xmobar_window\"  )\n            , ( 15,
  \ True, \"/tmp/xmobar_status\"  )\n            ]\n\n  Have your window manager send
  window titles to\n  `\"/tmp/xmobar_window\"`. They will always be shown and not
  reveal\n  your xmobar.  Sending some status information to\n  `\"/tmp/xmobar_status\"`
  will reveal xmonad for 1.5 seconds and\n  temporarily overwrite the window titles.\n-
  Take a look at [samples/status.sh]\n- Expands environment variables for the pipe

  from xmonad's `_XMONAD_LOG`. You can set this\n  property by using `xmonadPropLog`
  as your log hook in xmonad's\n  configuration, as in the following example (more
  info [here]):\n\n        main = do\n          spawn \"xmobar\"\n          xmonad
  $ defaultConfig {\n            logHook = dynamicLogString defaultPP >>= xmonadPropLog\n
  \         }\n   This plugin can be used as a sometimes more convenient alternative\n
  \  to `StdinReader`. For instance, it allows you to (re)start xmobar\n   outside
  xmonad.\n\n[here]: http://xmonad.org/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Hooks-DynamicLog.html\n\n<font
  size=\"+1\">**`UnsafeXMonadLog`**</font>\n\n- Aliases to UnsafeXMonadLog\n- Similar
  to StdinReader versus UnsafeStdinReader, this does not strip `<action\n  ...>` tags
  from XMonad's `_XMONAD_LOG`.\n- It is advised that you still use `xmobarStrip` for
  the ppTitle in your\n  logHook:\n\n        myPP = defaultPP { ppTitle = xmobarStrip
  }\n        main = xmonad $ defaultConfig {\n          logHook = dynamicLogString
  myPP >>= xmonadPropLog\n        }\n\n# Plugins\n\n## Writing a Plugin\n\nWriting
  a plugin for xmobar should be very simple. You need to create\na data type with
  at least one constructor.\n\nNext you must declare this data type an instance of
  the `Exec` class, by\ndefining the 1 needed method (alternatively `start` or `run`)
  and 2\noptional ones (alias and rate):\n\n        start :: e -> (String -> IO ())
  -> IO ()\n        run   :: e -> IO String\n        rate  :: e -> Int\n        alias
  :: e -> String\n\n`start` must receive a callback to be used to display the `String`\nproduced
  by the plugin. This method can be used for plugins that need\nto perform asynchronous
  actions. See `Plugins/PipeReader.hs` for an\nexample.\n\n`run` can be used for simpler
  plugins. If you define only `run` the\nplugin will be run every second. To overwrite
  this default you just\nneed to implement `rate`, which must return the number of
  tenth of\nseconds between every successive runs. See `Plugins/HelloWorld.hs` for\nan
  example of a plugin that runs just once, and `Plugins/Date.hs` for\none that implements
  `rate`.\n\nNotice that Date could be implemented as:\n\n        instance Exec Date
  where\n            alias (Date _ a _) = a\n            start (Date f _ r) = date
  f r\n\n        date :: String -> Int -> (String -> IO ()) -> IO ()\n        date
  format r callback = do go\n            where go = do\n                    t <- toCalendarTime
  =<< getClockTime\n                    callback $ formatCalendarTime defaultTimeLocale
  format t\n                    tenthSeconds r >> go\n\nThis implementation is equivalent
  to the one you can read in\n`Plugins/Date.hs`.\n\n`alias` is the name to be used
  in the output template. Default alias\nwill be the data type constructor.\n\nImplementing
  a plugin requires importing the plugin API (the `Exec`\nclass definition), that
  is exported by `Plugins.hs`. So you just need\nto import it in your module with:\n\n
  \       import Plugins\n\nAfter that your type constructor can be used as an argument
  for the\nRunnable type constructor `Run` in the `commands` list of the\nconfiguration
  options.\n\nThis requires importing your plugin into `Config.hs` and adding your\ntype
  to the type list in the type signature of `Config.runnableTypes`.\n\nFor a very
  basic example see `samples/Plugins/HelloWorld.hs` or the\nother plugins that are
  distributed with xmobar.\n\n## Installing/Removing a Plugin\n\nInstalling a plugin
  should require 3 steps. Here we are going to\ninstall the HelloWorld plugin that
  comes with xmobar, assuming that\nyou copied it to `src/Plugins`:\n\n1. import the
  plugin module in `Config.hs`, by adding:\n\n        import Plugins.HelloWorld\n\n2.
  add the plugin data type to the list of data types in the type\n   signature of
  `runnableTypes` in `Config.hs`. For instance, for the\n   HelloWorld plugin, change
  `runnableTypes` into:\n\n        runnableTypes :: Command :*: Monitors :*: HelloWorld
  :*: ()\n        runnableTypes = undefined\n\n3. Rebuild and reinstall xmobar. Now
  test it with:\n\n        xmobar Plugins/helloworld.config\n\nAs you may see in the
  example configuration file, the plugin can be\nused by adding, in the `commands`
  list:\n\n        Run HelloWorld\n\nand, in the output template, the alias of the
  plugin:\n\n        %helloWorld%\n\nThat's it.\n\nTo remove a plugin, just remove
  its type from the type signature of\nrunnableTypes and remove the imported modules.\n\nTo
  remove the system monitor plugin:\n\n1. remove, from `Config.hs`, the line\n\n        import
  Plugins.Monitors\n\n2. in `Config.hs` change\n\n         runnableTypes :: Command
  :*: Monitors :*: ()\n         runnableTypes = undefined\n\n    to\n\n         runnableTypes
  :: Command :*: ()\n         runnableTypes = undefined\n\n3. rebuild xmobar.\n\n#
