  ## Version 0.39 (unreleased)

  _New features_

    - New constructors for only controlling bar height:
      TopH and BottomH for Top and Bottom respectively
    - New monitor: k10temp (Sam Kirby)
    - Better handling of command line arguments for Haskell-based
      configuration keys (see #553 and #554)
    - New monitor: Kraken (Amid Saeid)

  _Bug fixes_

    - NotmuchMail usable in text configurations (#547)
    - Fix for off-by-one in padding (#560)
    - Fixes for Kbd (#561)

  ## Version 0.38 (May, 2021)

  _Bug fixes_

    - Fix off-by-one in strut calculation for `Static` position which reserved
      space for the panel than necessary and caused issues in some multi-head
      setups (fixes #530).
    - Revert the double-UTF-8 encoding workarounds of 0.36 (#482), as they're no
      longer necessary with xmonad-contrib master, and aren't needed with any
      released version of xmonad-contrib either.
    - Fix slow reactions to SIGUSR1/2 signals (reposition, change screen).

  ## Version 0.37 (November, 2020)

  _New features_

    - New command line option `--add-font` (Ivan Brennan)
    - New monitor `MPDX` that extends `MPD` with the ability of having a
      custom alias.  Useful for connecting with multiple servers.
    - New plugin `NotmuchMail` to monitor mail indexed by `notmuch`.

  _Bug fixes_

    - Fix date plugin not picking up DST and timezone changes (refresh
      timezone once a minute to preserve the optimized performace of 0.34).

  ## Version 0.36 (August, 2020)

  _New features_

    - Monitor progress bars: a value of 0 for `-W` denotes an index in
      the `-f` string, similar to icon patterns but using characters.
    - New tag `<box>` to add borders around text (Unoqwy).
    - `fc` color background now accepts an offset (Unoqwy).

  _Bug fixes_

    - Documentation fixes (Tomáš Janoušek)
    - Don't get confused by empty configuration dirs (fixes #412)
    - Xft rendering: Avoid encoding to UTF8 on all scenarios. This
      causes issue to StdinReader monitor when the handle wasn't binary.

  ## Version 0.35.1 (June, 2020)

  - Dropped support for GHC < 8.4 (see issue #461)

  ## Version 0.35 (June, 2020)

  _New features_

    - `MultiCoreTemp` now works with Ryzen processors.  New option
      `--hwmon-path` for better performance.
    - CPU Monitor optimizations.
    - Version bumps for some dependencies, including timezone-olson.

  ## Version 0.34 (June, 2020)

  _New features_

    - New plugin `HandleReader` for reading data from a Haskell `Handle`. This is
      useful if you are running xmobar from within a Haskell program.
    - Build with ghc 8.10 allowed.
    - Optimize date plugin by avoiding calling getTimeZone for each of
      the time the date has to be updated. Instead, it's computed once
      at the start and re-used for each invocation.
    - Optimize Weather and UVMeter plugin by using global Manager
      instead of creating for each http request when useManager is
      explicitly configured as False.

  ## Version 0.33 (February, 2020)

  _New features_

    - New template parameter `<weather>` for the `Weather` plugin, potentially
      displaying specific weather conditions that are occurring near the
      station (thanks to *slotThe*).
    - New option `--weathers`, for `Weather` to display a default string in
      case the `weather` field is not reported (thanks to *slotThe*).
    - New template parameter `<volumestatus>` for the `Volume` plugin, combining
      the effects of `<volume>` and `<status>`.  This will show the volume
      (possibly prefixed by `onString` or a percentage-based string) if and only
      if the volume is not muted.  Otherwise it will show the
      `offString` (thanks to *slotThe*).
    - `Battery` and `BatteryN` now support FreeBSD (thanks to Dhananjay
      Balan).
    - New option `--useManager` for `Weather` and `UVMeter` to decide whether to
      use one single manager per monitor for managing network connections or
      create a new one every time a connection is made.
    - New more efficient time coalescing strategy for monitor updates,
      available with the threaded runtime: use the `with_threaded` flag
      to enable it (see #410; thanks to Tomáš Janoušek).
    - `Wireless` supports current nl80211 API on Linux now, old Wext ioctls still
      available as compile-time option (thanks to Paul Fertser).

  ## Version 0.32 (December, 2019)

  _New features_

    - New options `--host` and `--port` for `MPD` monitor.
    - New plugin `MailX` extending `Mail` with colors and prefix/suffix.
    - New options `--lows`, `--mediums`, and `--highs` for `Battery`
      to display an additional string depending on battery level (thanks
      to *slotThe*).
    - New options `-L` and `-H` for `Volume` to set low and high volume
      levels, as well as `-l`, `-m`, and `-h` to display an additional
      string depending on current volume level (thanks to *slotThe*).
    - New option `-P` in `Battery` to add a `%` symbol to `<left>`.
    - New option `--devices` in `DynNetwork` to select what interfaces
      to monitor (thanks to *vindex10*).
    - DateZone plugin now also checks TZDIR (thanks to Emmanuel Rosa).

  _Bug fixes_

     - `Kbd` plugin: ignore "terminate" layout token (thanks to Greg
       Steuck).
     - Fixed compilation with GHC 8.8.x (thanks to Vanessa McHale).
     - Avoid creating `~/.xmobar` ([issue #405]).

  _New features_

    - New monitor `MultiCoreTemp`, thanks to Felix Springer.
    - `DiskIO`: Additional template variables for absolute number of
      bytes rather than speeds (see [issue #390]).
    - `WeatherX`: An extension to the `Weather` monitor allowing the
      spefication of custom strings or icons for sky conditions.
    - The battery monitors accept the new arguments `-a` and `-A` to
      specify a system command executed if battery left goes beyond a
      given threshold.

  ## Version 0.19 (October 27, 2013)

  As of this release, the old bug tracker at Google code is deprecated.
  Please use [Github's tracker] for new bugs.

  _New features_

    - New monitor `BatteryN`, a variant of `BatteryP` that lets you
      specify the name of the monitor in the template.
    - Support for configuration file living in `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (see
      [github #99]).
    - `Com` uses safer `runInteractiveProcess` instead of spawning a
      shell (David McLean).  If you're using shell expansion in your
      `Com` (e.g. "~/bin/script") here's a workaround: `Run Com
      "/bin/bash" ["-c", "~/bin/script"]` (cf. [github #127]).
    - New plugin `UnsafeStdinReader` that allows actions from stdin.
      Now it's possible to have clickable workspaces!
      (Thiago Negri, see [github #125]).
    - New monitor configuration option (`-x` or `--nastring`) that allows
      specifying what string to display when a monitor is not available
      (defaulting to "N/A"). Cf. [github #119].

  _Bug fixes_

    - Using the width options `-w`, `-m` and `-M` in battery monitors
      watts display ([github #118]).
    - Using the `-d` option in `CoreTemp` ([github #115])
    - Fix for systems not supporting PCRE regular expressions: we use
      now BCEs, so regex-compat should be enough everywhere (see
      [github #117]).
    - Weather monitor: support for stations without name (Sergei
      Trofimovich, [issue #65]).

  ## Version 0.18 (June 5, 2013)

  _New features_

    - All extra argument monitors taking a string (e.g. `-O` for
      `BatteryP`) accept now template variables (see [github #109] and
      [#110]).  Thanks to Todd Lunter.

    - New battery monitor extra argument, `-i`, for the idle status.

  _Bug fixes_

    - Safer standard input parsing, avoiding <action> injections.

  ## Version 0.17 (May 5, 2013)

  _New features_

    - Icons support: it's now possible to insert bitmaps in the template
      (Edward O'Callaghan, Alexander Polakov and Tomáš Janoušek).
    - Initial support for reacting to mouse clicks (Alexander Polakov).
    - New `TopP` and `BottomP` alignments, taking left and right
      paddings (thanks to Dmitry Malikov).
    - New `<freeratio>` field for memory monitor (Peter Simons).
    - New `allDesktops` and `overrideRedirect` configuration options,
      providing dock behaviour in tiling WMs (when set to True and False
      respectively). Cf. discussion at [github #105].
    - Experimental `-d` (start as a dock) option, may address [github #67]
      in some window managers.

  _Bug fixes_

    - Partial (as reports go) fix for [github #77].
    - Safer volume plugin (Dmitry Malikov).
    - Battery percentage capped at 100% (RJ Regenold).

  ## Version 0.16 (Dec 3, 2012)

  _New features_

    - New monitor `AutoMPD`, which uses asynchronous events to display
      MPD status (thanks to Ben Boeckel).
    - New monitor `BufferedPipeReader` displaying data from multiple
      pipes (thanks to Jochen Keil).
    - New monitor `DynNetwork`, which detects the active interface
      automatically, by Reto Hablützel
    - New monitor, `Locks`, displaying the status of lock keys, by
      Patrick Chilton.
    - Extension for DBUS signal handling (Jochen Keil)
    - Hide/Reveal: one can send signals to xmobar and make it (un)hide
      itself (Jochen again).
    - `PipeReader`'s default text is now configurable, by Reto Hablützel.
    - Dependencies updated to latest mtl and libmpd (thanks to Sergei
      Trofimovich).
    - Dependencies on the deprecated dbus-core removed in favour of
      dbus 0.10 (thanks to Jochen Keil).
    - MPris2 now includes genre and composer among its fields.

  _Bug fixes_

    - `DiskIO` now can report overall activity in all partitions of a device
      which is not mounted itself (e.g., sda when sda1, sda3, etc. are
      the mounted partitions).  Thanks to John Soros. See [github #73].
    - `DiskU`, the disk usage monitor, works again correctly on Linux,
      instead of randomly crashing every now and then, and reporting
      wrong used size.
    - When using antialiased fonts, we were causing a memory leak in the
      X server by repeatedly allocating colors that, apparently, the
      server doesn't know how to get rid of (even when told so!).  We're
      caching them now and X server memory doesn't grow.
    - Compilation errors and warnings with GHC 7.6 removed (thanks to
      Raghavendra D Prabhu for his reports in [github #71]).

  _Known problems_

  Some users have reported problems with xmobar compiled with GHC 7.6 in
  ArchLinux: see [github #78] and pointers therein.  Please, send
  reports of any problems or successes in that regard so that we can fix
  any remaining issues.  Thanks!

  ## Version 0.15 (June 4, 2012)

  _Incompatible changes_

    - `Batt` monitor no longer uses `-c` to specify the charge file: it
      should figure things out by itself (cf. [issue 69]).

  _New features_

    - New command line option, `-C`, that allows *adding* commands to
      those specified in the configuration file (Ben Boeckel).
    - Dependency on GHC's threaded runtime has been eliminated.
    - New MPRIS (versions 1 and 2) monitor, by Artem Tarasov.
    - New monitor option `-d` to specify the number of decimal places to
      display for float numbers.  Defaults to 0. See [issue 58].
    - New compilation option `--with_threaded`, to use GHC's threaded
      runtime to compile xmobar.  Disabled by default (cf. discussion in
      [github #36]).

  _Bug fixes_

    - Stricter build dependencies versioning in cabal file.
    - [issue 56] vertical alignment of text improved.
    - [issue 64] display of `watts` in `Batt` monitor fixed.
    - [issue 69] miscellaneous battery reporting issues.
    - [issue 67] compilation in DragonFly.
    - DiskIO works also when device path in mtab are symbolic links
      to the real device file.
    - Wireless monitor honours padding settings for ESSID names.
    - CoreTemp monitor fixed for newer kernels ([github #38]).

  ## Version 0.13 (March 28, 2011)

  _New features_

    - New `Volume` monitor displaying ALSA soundcards information, by
      Thomas Tuegel.
    - New `ThermalZone` plugin substituting `Thermal` and using linux's
      *sysfs* interface (you need this one if you're using a kernel
      version equal to or above 2.6.37). See [issue 44].
    - xmobar app new has WM_CLASS, WM_NAME and _NET_WM_PID xprops
      ([issue 38]).

  _Incompatible changes_

    - In the process of solving [issue 14], we've broken those
      configurations that rely on including alignment separators in the
      input fed to `StdinReader`.
    - The MPD plugin does not accept host and port options anymore: use
      the environment variables MPD_HOST and MPD_PORT instead.
    - The `Mail` plugin now takes a second parameter (a string)
      specifying its alias. As a side-effect, this solves [issue 30].

  _Bug fixes_

      input don't get confused anymore when characters from `alignSep`
      appear in their input.
    - [issue 27] `BottomSize` placement now respects its width argument.
    - [issue 28] Compilation in Mac OS X fixed.
    - [issue 30] `Mail` plugin can be specified anywhere in commands list.
    - [issue 36] Battery monitor now supports non-standard locations of
      the `/sys/class/power_supply/AC/online` file.
    - [issue 40] Battery monitor now supports the new power_now, that
      replaces current_now in linux kernels for v. 2.36 and above.
    - [issue 42] More accurate net monitor rates.
    - DiskIO, Cpu and MultiCpu monitors are also more accurate now.
    - Text is now correctly centered vertically.
    - `FullBM` border spec fixed.

  * About

  Xmobar is a minimalistic status bar. It was originally designed and
  implemented by Andrea Rossato to work with [[http://xmonad.org][xmonad]], but it is actually
  usable with any window manager.

  Xmobar was inspired by the [[http://tuomov.iki.fi/software/][Ion3]] status bar, and supports similar
  features, like dynamic color management, icons, output templates, and
  extensibility through plugins.

  These are some xmobar [[file:doc/screenshots][screenshots]] using the author's configuration:

  [[file:doc/screenshots/xmobar-top.png]]

  [[file:doc/screenshots/xmobar-bottom.png]]

  [[file:doc/screenshots/xmobar-exwm.png]]

  This is the [[https://xmobar.org/changelog.html][changelog]] for recent releases.

  * Installation
  ** From your Systems Package Manager

  Xmobar is probably available from your distributions package manager!
  Most distributions compile xmobar with the =all_extensions= flag, so you
  don't have to.

  *** Arch Linux

  #+begin_src shell
    pacman -S xmobar
  #+end_src

  *** Debian/Ubuntu based

  #+begin_src shell
    apt install xmobar
  #+end_src

  *** OpenSUSE

  #+begin_src shell
    zypper install xmobar
  #+end_src

  *** Void Linux

  #+begin_src shell
    xbps-install xmobar
  #+end_src

  *** Gentoo
  #+begin_src shell
    emerge --ask xmobar
  #+end_src

  ** Using cabal-install

  Xmobar is available from [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmobar/][Hackage]], and you can install it using
  =cabal-install=:

  #+begin_src shell
    cabal install xmobar
  #+end_src

  Starting with version 0.35.1, xmobar now requires at least GHC version
  8.4.x. to build. See [[https://github.com/jaor/xmobar/issues/461][this issue]] for more information.

  See [[file:doc/compiling.org][compiling]] for a list of optional compilation flags that will enable
  some optional plugins. For instance, to install xmobar with all the
  bells and whistles (this is probably what you want), use:

  #+begin_src shell
    cabal install xmobar --flags="all_extensions"
  #+end_src

  ** From source

  See [[file:doc/compiling.org][compiling]].

  * Running xmobar

  You can run xmobar with:

  #+begin_src shell
    xmobar /path/to/config &
  #+end_src

  or

  #+begin_src shell
    xmobar &
  #+end_src

  if you have the default configuration file saved as
  =$XDG\_CONFIG\_HOME/xmobar/xmobarrc= (defaulting to
  =~/.config/xmobar/xmobarrc=), or =~/.xmobarrc=.

  ** Signal Handling

  Since 0.14 xmobar reacts to SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2:

  - After receiving SIGUSR1 xmobar moves its position to the next screen.

  - After receiving SIGUSR2 xmobar repositions itself on the current
    screen.

  * Configuration and Further Links

  - If you want to jump straight into configuring xmobar, head over to the
    [[./doc/quick-start.org][quick-start]] guide.

  - If you want to get a detailed overview of all available plugins and
    monitors, visit the [[./doc/plugins.org][plugins]] file.

  - If you want to know how to contribute to the xmobar project, check out
    [[contributing.org][contributing]].

  - If you want to write your own plugins, see [[./doc/write-your-own-plugin.org][write-your-own-plugin]].

  * Authors and credits

  0.11.1. Since then, it is maintained and developed by [[https://jao.io][jao]], with the help
  of the greater xmobar and Haskell communities.
