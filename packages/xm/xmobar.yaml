  ## Version 0.30 (August, 2019)

  _New features_

    - New monitor `MultiCoreTemp`, thanks to Felix Springer.
    - `DiskIO`: Additional template variables for absolute number of
      bytes rather than speeds (see [issue #390].

  ## Version 0.19 (October 27, 2013)

  As of this release, the old bug tracker at Google code is deprecated.
  Please use [Github's tracker] for new bugs.

  _New features_

    - New monitor `BatteryN`, a variant of `BatteryP` that lets you
      specify the name of the monitor in the template.
    - Support for configuration file living in `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (see
      [github #99]).
    - `Com` uses safer `runInteractiveProcess` instead of spawning a
      shell (David McLean).  If you're using shell expansion in your
      `Com` (e.g. "~/bin/script") here's a workaround: `Run Com
      "/bin/bash" ["-c", "~/bin/script"]` (cf. [github #127]).
    - New plugin `UnsafeStdinReader` that allows actions from stdin.
      Now it's possible to have clickable workspaces!
      (Thiago Negri, see [github #125]).
    - New monitor configuration option (`-x` or `--nastring`) that allows
      specifying what string to display when a monitor is not available
      (defaulting to "N/A"). Cf. [github #119].

  _Bug fixes_

    - Using the width options `-w`, `-m` and `-M` in battery monitors
      watts display ([github #118]).
    - Using the `-d` option in `CoreTemp` ([github #115])
    - Fix for systems not supporting PCRE regular expressions: we use
      now BCEs, so regex-compat should be enough everywhere (see
      [github #117]).
    - Weather monitor: support for stations without name (Sergei
      Trofimovich, [issue #65]).

  ## Version 0.18 (June 5, 2013)

  _New features_

    - All extra argument monitors taking a string (e.g. `-O` for
      `BatteryP`) accept now template variables (see [github #109] and
      [#110]).  Thanks to Todd Lunter.

    - New battery monitor extra argument, `-i`, for the idle status.

  _Bug fixes_

    - Safer standard input parsing, avoiding <action> injections.

  [#110]: https://github.com/jaor/xmobar/issues/110

  ## Version 0.17 (May 5, 2013)

  _New features_

    - Icons support: it's now possible to insert bitmaps in the template
      (Edward O'Callaghan, Alexander Polakov and Tomáš Janoušek).
    - Initial support for reacting to mouse clicks (Alexander Polakov).
    - New `TopP` and `BottomP` alignments, taking left and right
      paddings (thanks to Dmitry Malikov).
    - New `<freeratio>` field for memory monitor (Peter Simons).
    - New `allDesktops` and `overrideRedirect` configuration options,
      providing dock behaviour in tiling WMs (when set to True and False
      respectively). Cf. discussion at [github #105].
    - Experimental `-d` (start as a dock) option, may address [github #67]
      in some window managers.

  _Bug fixes_

    - Partial (as reports go) fix for [github #77].
    - Safer volume plugin (Dmitry Malikov).
    - Battery percentage capped at 100% (RJ Regenold).

  ## Version 0.16 (Dec 3, 2012)

  _New features_

    - New monitor `AutoMPD`, which uses asynchronous events to display
      MPD status (thanks to Ben Boeckel).
    - New monitor `BufferedPipeReader` displaying data from multiple
      pipes (thanks to Jochen Keil).
    - New monitor `DynNetwork`, which detects the active interface
      automatically, by Reto Hablützel
    - New monitor, `Locks`, displaying the status of lock keys, by
      Patrick Chilton.
    - Extension for DBUS signal handling (Jochen Keil)
    - Hide/Reveal: one can send signals to xmobar and make it (un)hide
      itself (Jochen again).
    - `PipeReader`'s default text is now configurable, by Reto Hablützel.
    - Dependencies updated to latest mtl and libmpd (thanks to Sergei
      Trofimovich).
    - Dependencies on the deprecated dbus-core removed in favour of
      dbus 0.10 (thanks to Jochen Keil).
    - MPris2 now includes genre and composer among its fields.

  _Bug fixes_

    - `DiskIO` now can report overall activity in all partitions of a device
      which is not mounted itself (e.g., sda when sda1, sda3, etc. are
      the mounted partitions).  Thanks to John Soros. See [github #73].
    - `DiskU`, the disk usage monitor, works again correctly on Linux,
      instead of randomly crashing every now and then, and reporting
      wrong used size.
    - When using antialiased fonts, we were causing a memory leak in the
      X server by repeatedly allocating colors that, apparently, the
      server doesn't know how to get rid of (even when told so!).  We're
      caching them now and X server memory doesn't grow.
    - Compilation errors and warnings with GHC 7.6 removed (thanks to
      Raghavendra D Prabhu for his reports in [github #71]).

  _Known problems_

  Some users have reported problems with xmobar compiled with GHC 7.6 in
  ArchLinux: see [github #78] and pointers therein.  Please, send
  reports of any problems or successes in that regard so that we can fix
  any remaining issues.  Thanks!

      those specified in the configuration file (Ben Boeckel).
    - Dependency on GHC's threaded runtime has been eliminated.
    - New MPRIS (versions 1 and 2) monitor, by Artem Tarasov.
    - New monitor option `-d` to specify the number of decimal places to
      display for float numbers.  Defaults to 0. See [issue 58].
    - New compilation option `--with_threaded`, to use GHC's threaded
      runtime to compile xmobar.  Disabled by default (cf. discussion in
      [github #36]).

  _Bug fixes_

    - Stricter build dependencies versioning in cabal file.
    - [issue 56] vertical alignment of text improved.
    - [issue 64] display of `watts` in `Batt` monitor fixed.
    - [issue 69] miscellaneous battery reporting issues.

  ## Version 0.13 (March 28, 2011)

  _New features_

    - New `Volume` monitor displaying ALSA soundcards information, by
      Thomas Tuegel.
    - New `ThermalZone` plugin substituting `Thermal` and using linux's
      *sysfs* interface (you need this one if you're using a kernel
      version equal to or above 2.6.37). See [issue 44].
    - xmobar app new has WM_CLASS, WM_NAME and _NET_WM_PID xprops
      ([issue 38]).

  _Incompatible changes_

    - In the process of solving [issue 14], we've broken those
      configurations that rely on including alignment separators in the
      input fed to `StdinReader`.
    - The MPD plugin does not accept host and port options anymore: use
      the environment variables MPD_HOST and MPD_PORT instead.
    - The `Mail` plugin now takes a second parameter (a string)
      specifying its alias. As a side-effect, this solves [issue 30].

  _Bug fixes_

    - [issue 14] `StdinReader` and other plugins accepting external
      input don't get confused anymore when characters from `alignSep`
      appear in their input.
    - [issue 27] `BottomSize` placement now respects its width argument.
    - [issue 28] Compilation in Mac OS X fixed.
    - [issue 30] `Mail` plugin can be specified anywhere in commands list.
    - [issue 36] Battery monitor now supports non-standard locations of
      the `/sys/class/power_supply/AC/online` file.
    - [issue 40] Battery monitor now supports the new power_now, that
      replaces current_now in linux kernels for v. 2.36 and above.
    - [issue 42] More accurate net monitor rates.
    - DiskIO, Cpu and MultiCpu monitors are also more accurate now.
    - Text is now correctly centered vertically.
    - `FullBM` border spec fixed.

  ## Version 0.12 (Dec 24, 2010)

  xmobar has a new [maintainer], a new [website], a new [mailing
  list] and uses a new [source code repository].

  Many thanks to Andrea Rossato, xmobar's author and maintainer so far,
  for creating xmobar in the first place, and for giving me the chance
  to become its maintainer. And a big thanks to Ben Boeckel, Petr Rockai
  and Norbert Zeh for their patches.

  [website]: http://projects.haskell.org/xmobar/
  [mailing list]: http://projects.haskell.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/xmobar
  [source code repository]: https://github.com/jaor/xmobar
  [maintainer]: http://hacks-galore.org/jao/

  _New features_

    - Window borders: configuration options `border` and `borderColor`
      allow drawing borders around xmobar's window.
    - New monitor, `Uptime`, showing the system uptime.
    - New monitor argument (`-S`) to enable displaying the `%` symbol in
      percentages or other suffixes (e.g., units in Uptime and Network);
      the symbol is now never included by default.
    - New 'run once' commands, by specifying a 0 refresh rate in `Run
      Com` ([issue 26]).
    - MPD monitor: updated to libmpd 1.5. New fields `ppos` (playlist
      position) and `remaining` (remaining time). New configuration
      options to specify MPD's host, user name and password.
    - Battery monitor: new `watts` and `timeleft` fields (Petr Rockai),
      and specific arguments to control coloring and thresholds of the
      former.
    - MultiCPU monitor: new `auto*` fields that automatically detect all
      present CPUs (Ben Boeckel).
    - CpuFreq monitor uses just one decimal digit for GHz values (Petr
      Rockai).
    - Mail plugin expands paths starting with "~/" (Ben Boeckel). Ditto
      MBox.
    - Weather monitor now skips not retrieved fields, instead of
      displaying a long error message.
    - New compilation flag, `all_extensions`.
    - Documentation and website updates.

  _Bug fixes_

    - [issue 23] Wireless monitor is now compatible with iwlib 29.
    - [issue 24] Swap monitor's used ratio display fixed.
    - [issue 25] Percentages only include `%` if requested using `-P`.
    - [issue 31] MPD monitor now respects `-W` argument.
    - Fixes in CPU frequency formatting, string alignment and colour
      boxes in monitors (Norbert Zeh).
    - TopMem and TopProc now use the `-L` and `-H` options correctly for
      memory template fields.
    - MBox skips non-existent mbox paths instead of hanging.

description: "[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/xmobar.svg)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmobar)\n[![Build
  Status](https://travis-ci.org/jaor/xmobar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jaor/xmobar)\n\n#
  About\n\nXmobar is a minimalistic status bar. It was originally designed and\nimplemented
  by Andrea Rossato to work with [xmonad], but it is\nactually usable with any window
  manager.\n\nXmobar was inspired by the [Ion3] status bar, and supports similar\nfeatures,
  like dynamic color management, icons, output templates, and\nextensibility through
  plugins.\n\nThese are two xmobar instances using the author's configuration:\n\n![top](https://gitlab.com/jaor/xmobar-config/raw/master/img/xmobar-top.png)\n\n![bottom](https://gitlab.com/jaor/xmobar-config/raw/master/img/xmobar-bottom.png)\n\nand
  [this one](doc/xmobar-xmonad.png) is a full desktop with [xmonad]\nand, again, two
  instances of xmobar.\n\n[xmonad]: http://xmonad.org\n[Ion3]: http://tuomov.iki.fi/software/\n\n#
  Bug Reports\n\nTo submit bug reports you can use the [bug tracker over at\nGithub](https://github.com/jaor/xmobar/issues).\n\n#
  Installation\n\n## Using cabal-install\n\nXmobar is available from [Hackage], and
  you can install it using\n`cabal-install`:\n\n        cabal install xmobar\n\nXmobar
  versions >= 0.27 require GHC version >= 8.0.2.  Due to an\nintermittent bug in GHC,
  we recommend using either GHC 8.0.2, 8.2.2 or\n8.6.\n\nSee below for a list of optional
  compilation flags that will enable\nsome optional plugins. For instance, to install
  xmobar with all the\nbells and whistles, use:\n\n        cabal install xmobar --flags=\"all_extensions\"\n\n##
  From source\n\nIf you don't have `cabal-install` installed, you can get xmobar's\nsource
  code in a variety of ways:\n\n  - From [Hackage]. Just download the latest release
  from xmobar's\n    hackage page.\n  - From [Github]. You can also obtain a tarball
  in [Github's\n    downloads page]. You'll find there links to each tagged release.\n
  \ - From the bleeding edge repo. If you prefer to live dangerously,\n    just get
  the latest and greatest (and buggiest, I guess) using\n    git:\n\n        git clone
  git://github.com/jaor/xmobar\n\n\n[Github's downloads page]: https://github.com/jaor/xmobar/downloads\n\nIf
  you have cabal installed, you can now use it from within xmobar's\nsource tree:\n\n
  \       cabal install -fall_extensions\n\n\nThere is also a barebones `stack.yaml`
  file that will allow you to\nbuild the xmobar executable with stances of the form:\n\n
  \       stack install --flag xmobar:all_extensions\n\n\n## Optional features\n\nYou
  can configure xmobar to include some optional plugins and\nfeatures, which are not
  compiled by default. To that end, you need to\nadd one or more flags to either the
  cabal install command or the\nconfigure setup step, as shown in the examples above.\n\nExtensions
  need additional libraries (listed below) that will be\nautomatically downloaded
  and installed if you're using cabal install.\nOtherwise, you'll need to install
  them yourself.\n\n- `with_dbus` Enables support for DBUS by making xmobar to publish
  a\n  service on the session bus.  Requires the [dbus] package.\n\n- `with_threaded`
  Uses GHC's threaded runtime.  Use this option if\n  xmobar enters a high-CPU regime
  right after starting.\n\n- `with_utf8` UTF-8 support. Requires the [utf8-string]
  package.\n\n- `with_xft` Antialiased fonts. Requires the [X11-xft] package. This\n
  \ option automatically enables UTF-8.  To use XFT fonts you need to\n  use the `xft:`
  prefix in the `font` configuration option. For\n  instance:\n\n        font = \"xft:Times
  New Roman-10:italic\"\n\n  Or to have fallback fonts, just separate them by commas:\n\n
  \       font = \"xft:Open Sans:size=9,WenQuanYi Zen Hei:size=9\"\n\n- `with_mpd`
  Enables support for the [MPD] daemon. Requires the\n  [libmpd] package.\n\n- `with_mpris`
  Enables support for MPRIS v1/v2 protocol.  Requires the\n  [dbus] and [text] packages.\n\n-
  `with_inotify` Support for inotify in modern Linux kernels. This\n  option is needed
  for the MBox and Mail plugins to work. Requires the\n  [hinotify] package.\n\n-
  `with_iwlib` Support for wireless cards. Enables the Wireless\n   plugin. No Haskell
  library is required, but you will need the\n   [iwlib] C library and headers in
  your system (e.g., install\n   `libiw-dev` in Debian-based systems or `wireless_tools`
  on Arch\n   Linux).\n\n- `with_alsa` Support for ALSA sound cards. Enables the Volume\n
  \  plugin. Requires the [alsa-mixer] package.  To install the latter,\n   you'll
  need the [libasound] C library and headers in your system\n   (e.g., install `libasound2-dev`
  in Debian-based systems).\n\n- `with_datezone` Support for other timezones. Enables
  the DateZone\n   plugin.  Requires [timezone-olson] and [timezone-series] package.\n\n-
  `with_xpm` Support for xpm image file format. This will allow loading\n  .xpm files
  in `<icon>`.  Requires the [libXpm] C library.\n\n- `with_uvmeter` Enables UVMeter
  plugin. The plugin shows UV data for\n   Australia.\n\n- `with_weather` Support
  to display weather information. Enables\n   Weather plugin.\n\n- `all_extensions`
  Enables all the extensions above.\n\n# Running xmobar\n\nYou can now run xmobar
  with:\n\n        xmobar /path/to/config &\n\nor\n\n        xmobar &\n\nif you have
  the default configuration file saved as\n`$XDG\\_CONFIG\\_HOME/xmobar/xmobarrc`
  (defaulting to\n`~/.config/xmobar/xmobarrc`), or `~/.xmobarrc`.\n\n## Signal Handling\n\nSince
  0.14 xmobar reacts to SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2:\n\n- After receiving SIGUSR1 xmobar moves
  its position to the next screen.\n\n- After receiving SIGUSR2 xmobar repositions
  itself on the current screen.\n\n# Configuration\n\n## Quick Start\n\nSee [examples/xmobar.config]
  for an example.\n\n[examples/xmobar.config]: http://github.com/jaor/xmobar/raw/master/examples/xmobar.config\n\nFor
  the output template:\n\n- `%command%` will execute command and print the output.
  The output\n  may contain markups to change the characters' color.\n\n- `<fc=#FF0000>string</fc>`
  will print `string` with `#FF0000` color\n  (red).\n\n- `<fn=1>string</fn>` will
  print `string` with the first font from\n  `additionalFonts`.  The index `0` corresponds
  to the standard font.\n\n- `<icon=/path/to/icon.xbm/>` will insert the given bitmap.
  XPM image\n  format is also supported when compiled with `--flags=\"with_xpm\"`.\n\n-
  ```<action=`command` button=12345>``` will execute given command\n  when clicked
  with specified buttons. If not specified, button is\n  equal to 1 (left mouse button).
  Using old syntax (without backticks\n  surrounding `command`) will result in `button`
  attribute being\n  ignored.\n\n- `<raw=len:str/>` allows the encapsulation of arbitrary
  text `str` (which\n  must be `len` `Char`s long, where `len` is encoded as a decimal
  sequence).\n  Careful use of this and `UnsafeStdinReader`, for example, permits
  window\n  managers to feed xmobar strings with `<action>` tags mixed with un-trusted\n
  \ content (e.g. window titles).  For example, if xmobar is invoked as\n\n    ```xmobar
  -c \"[Run UnsafeStdinReader]\" -t \"%UnsafeStdinReader%\"```\n\n  and receives on
  standard input the line\n\n    ```<action=`echo test` button=1><raw=41:<action=`echo
  mooo` button=1>foo</action>/></action>```\n\n  then it will display the text ```<action=`echo
  mooo` button=1>foo</action>```,\n  which, when clicked, will cause `test` to be
  echoed.\n\nOther configuration options:\n\n- `font` Name of the font to be used.
  Use the `xft:` prefix for XFT\n  fonts.\n\n- `additionalFonts` Haskell-style list
  of fonts to be used with the\n  `fn`-template.  Use the `xft:` prefix for XFT fonts.
  \ See also\n  `textOffsets` below.\n\n- `bgColor` Background color.\n\n- `fgColor`
  Default font color.\n\n- `alpha` The transparency.  0 is transparent, 255 is opaque.\n\n-
  `position` Top, TopP, TopW, TopSize, Bottom, BottomP, BottomW,\n  BottomSize or
  Static (with x, y, width and height).\n\n  TopP and BottomP take 2 arguments: left
  padding and right padding.\n\n  TopW and BottomW take 2 arguments: an alignment
  parameter (L for\n  left, C for centered, R for Right) and an integer for the percentage\n
  \ width xmobar window will have in respect to the screen width.\n\n  TopSize and
  BottomSize take 3 arguments: an alignment parameter, an\n  integer for the percentage
  width, and an integer for the minimum\n  pixel height that the xmobar window will
  have.\n\n  For example:\n\n          position = BottomW C 75\n\n  to place xmobar
  at the bottom, centered with the 75% of the screen\n  width.  Or\n\n          position
  = BottomP 120 0\n\n  to place xmobar at the bottom, with 120 pixel indent of the
  left.\n  Or\n\n          position = Static { xpos = 0 , ypos = 0, width = 1024,
  height = 15 }\n\n  or\n\n          position = Top\n\n- `textOffset` The vertical
  offset, in pixels, for the text baseline.\n   If negative or not given, xmobar will
  try to center text\n   vertically.\n\n- `textOffsets` A list of vertical offsets,
  in pixels, for the text\n   baseline, to be used with the each of the fonts in\n
  \  `additionalFonts` (if any).  If negative or not given, xmobar will\n   try to
  center text vertically for that font.\n\n- `iconOffset` The vertical offset, in
  pixels, for icons bottom line.\n   If negative or not given, xmobar will try to
  center icons\n   vertically.\n\n- `lowerOnStart` When True the window is sent the
  bottom of the window\n  stack initially.\n\n- `hideOnStart` When set to True the
  window is initially not mapped,\n  i.e. hidden. It then can be toggled manually
  (for example using the\n  dbus interface) or automatically (by a plugin) to make
  it reappear.\n\n- `allDesktops` When set to True (the default), xmobar will tell
  the\n  window manager explicitly to be shown in all desktops, by setting\n  `_NET_WM_DESKTOP`
  to 0xffffffff.\n\n- `overrideRedirect` If you're running xmobar in a tiling window\n
  \ manager, you might need to set this option to `False` so that it\n  behaves as
  a docked application.  Defaults to `True`.\n\n- `pickBroadest` When multiple displays
  are available, xmobar will\n  choose by default the first one to place itself.  With
  this flag set\n  to `True` (the default is `False`) it will choose the broadest
  one\n  instead.\n\n- `persistent` When True the window status is fixed i.e. hiding
  or\n  revealing is not possible. This option can be toggled at\n  runtime. Defaults
  to False.\n\n- `border` TopB, TopBM, BottomB, BottomBM, FullB, FullBM or NoBorder\n
  \ (default).\n\n  TopB, BottomB, FullB take no arguments, and request drawing a
  border\n  at the top, bottom or around xmobar's window, respectively.\n\n  TopBM,
  BottomBM, FullBM take an integer argument, which is the\n  margin, in pixels, between
  the border of the window and the drawn\n  border.\n\n- `borderColor` Border color.\n\n-
  `borderWidth` Border width in pixels.\n\n- `iconRoot` Root folder where icons are
  stored. For <icon=path/> if\n  path start with `\"/\"`, `\"./\"` or `\"../\"` it
  is interpreted as it is.\n  Otherwise it will have `iconRoot ++ \"/\"` prepended
  to it. Default is\n  `\".\"`.\n\n- `commands` For setting the options of the programs
  to run\n  (optional).\n\n- `sepChar` The character to be used for indicating commands
  in the\n  output template (default '%').\n\n- `alignSep` a 2 character string for
  aligning text in the output\n  template. The text before the first character will
  be align to left,\n  the text in between the 2 characters will be centered, and
  the text\n  after the second character will be align to the right.\n\n- `template`
  The output template.\n\n- `wmClass` The value for the window's X11 WM_CLASS property.\n
  \ Defaults to \"xmobar\".\n\n- `wmName` The value for the window's X11 WM_NAME property.
  \ Defaults\n  to \"xmobar\".\n\n### Running xmobar with i3status\n\nxmobar can be
  used to display information generated by [i3status], a\nsmall program that gathers
  system information and outputs it in\nformats suitable for being displayed by the
  dzen2 status bar, wmii's\nstatus bar or xmobar's `StdinReader`.  See [i3status manual]
  for\nfurther details.\n\n### Dynamically sizing xmobar\n\nSee [this idea] by Jonas
  Camillus Jeppensen for a way of adapting\ndynamically xmobar's size and run it alongside
  a system tray widget\nsuch as trayer or stalonetray (although the idea is not limited
  to\ntrays, really).  For your convenience, there is a version of Jonas'\nscript
  in [examples/padding-icon.sh](./examples/padding-icon.sh).\n\n[this idea]: https://github.com/jaor/xmobar/issues/239#issuecomment-233206552\n\n##
  Command Line Options\n\nxmobar can be either configured with a configuration file
  or with\ncommand line options. In the second case, the command line options\nwill
  overwrite the corresponding options set in the configuration\nfile.\n\nExample:\n\n
  \   xmobar -B white -a right -F blue -t '%LIPB%' -c '[Run Weather \"LIPB\" [] 36000]'\n\nThis
  is the list of command line options (the output of\nxmobar --help):\n\n    Usage:
  xmobar [OPTION...] [FILE]\n    Options:\n      -h, -?        --help                 This
  help\n      -V            --version              Show version information\n      -v
  \           --verbose              Emit verbose debugging messages\n      -r            --recompile

  The DBus Interface\n\nWhen compiled with the optional `with_dbus` flag, xmobar can
  be\ncontrolled over dbus. All signals defined in [src/Signal.hs] as `data\nSignalType`
  can now be sent over dbus to xmobar.  Due to current\nlimitations of the implementation
  only one process of xmobar can\nacquire the dbus. This is handled on a first-come-first-served
  basis,\nmeaning that the first process will get the dbus interface. Other\nprocesses
  will run without further problems, yet have no dbus\ninterface.\n\n[src/Signal.hs]:
  https://github.com/jaor/xmobar/blob/master/src/Xmobar/System/Signal.hs\n\n- Bus
  Name: `org.Xmobar.Control`\n- Object Path: `/org/Xmobar/Control`\n- Member Name:
  Any of SignalType, e.g. `string:Reveal`\n- Interface Name: `org.Xmobar.Control`\n\nAn
  example using the `dbus-send` command line utility:\n\n        dbus-send \\\n            --session
  \\\n            --dest=org.Xmobar.Control \\\n            --type=method_call \\\n
  \           --print-reply \\\n            '/org/Xmobar/Control' \\\n            org.Xmobar.Control.SendSignal
  \\\n            \"string:Toggle 0\"\n\nIt is also possible to send multiple signals
  at once:\n\n        # send to another screen, reveal and toggle the persistent flag\n
  \       dbus-send [..] \\\n            \"string:ChangeScreen 0\" \"string:Reveal
  0\" \"string:TogglePersistent\"\n\nThe `Toggle`, `Reveal`, and `Hide` signals take
  an additional integer\nargument that denotes an initial delay, in tenths of a second,
  before\nthe command takes effect.\n\n### Example for using the DBus IPC interface
  with XMonad\n\nBind the key which should {,un}map xmobar to a dummy value. This
  is necessary\nfor {,un}grabKey in xmonad.\n\n    ((0, xK_Alt_L   ), return ())\n\nAlso,
  install `avoidStruts` layout modifier from `XMonad.Hooks.ManageDocks`\n\nFinally,
  install these two event hooks (`handleEventHook` in `XConfig`)\n`myDocksEventHook`
  is a replacement for `docksEventHook` which reacts on unmap\nevents as well (which
  `docksEventHook` doesn't).\n\n    import qualified XMonad.Util.ExtensibleState as
  XS\n\n    data DockToggleTime = DTT { lastTime :: Time } deriving (Eq, Show, Typeable)\n\n

  w  = ev_window e\n              et = ev_event_type e\n\n\n## The Output Template\n\nThe
  output template must contain at least one command. xmobar will\nparse the template
  and will search for the command to be executed in\nthe `commands` configuration
  option. First an `alias` will be searched\n(plugins such as Weather or Network have
  default aliases, see below).\nAfter that, the command name will be tried. If a command
  is found, the\narguments specified in the `commands` list will be used.\n\nIf no
  command is found in the `commands` list, xmobar will ask the\noperating system to
  execute a program with the name found in the\ntemplate. If the execution is not
  successful an error will be\nreported.\n\nIt's possible to insert in the global
  templates icon directives of the\nform:\n\n     <icon=/path/to/bitmap.xbm/>\n\nwhich
  will produce the expected result. Accepted image formats are XBM\nand XPM (when
  `with_xpm` flag is enabled). If path does not start with\n`\"/\"`, `\"./\"`, `\"../\"`
  it will have `iconRoot ++ \"/\"` prepended to it.\n\nIt's also possible to use action
  directives of the form:\n\n     <action=`command` button=12345>\n\nwhich will be
  executed when clicked on with specified mouse buttons. This tag\ncan be nested,
  allowing different commands to be run depending on button clicked.\n\n## The `commands`
  Configuration Option\n\nThe `commands` configuration option is a list of commands
  information\nand arguments to be used by xmobar when parsing the output template.\nEach
  member of the list consists in a command prefixed by the `Run`\nkeyword. Each command
  has arguments to control the way xmobar is going\nto execute it.\n\nThe option consists
  in a list of commands separated by a comma and\nenclosed by square parenthesis.\n\nExample:\n\n
  \   [Run Memory [\"-t\",\"Mem: <usedratio>%\"] 10, Run Swap [] 10]\n\nto run the
  Memory monitor plugin with the specified template, and the\nswap monitor plugin,
  with default options, every second.  And here's\nan example of a template for the
  commands above using an icon:\n\n    template=\"<icon=/home/jao/.xmobar/mem.xbm/><memory>
  <swap>\"\n\nThis example will run \"xclock\" command when date is clicked:\n\n    template=\"<action=`xclock`>%date%</action>\n\nThe
  only internal available command is `Com` (see below Executing\nExternal Commands).
  All other commands are provided by plugins. xmobar\ncomes with some plugins, providing
  a set of system monitors, a\nstandard input reader, an Unix named pipe reader, a
  configurable date\nplugin, and much more: we list all available plugins below.\n\nOther
  commands can be created as plugins with the Plugin\ninfrastructure. See below.\n\n##
  System Monitor Plugins\n\nThis is the description of the system monitor plugins
  available in\nxmobar.  Some of them are only installed when an optional build option\nis
  set: we mention that fact, when needed, in their description.\n\nEach monitor has
  an `alias` to be used in the output template.\nMonitors have default aliases.  The
  sections below describe every\nmonitor in turn, but before we provide a list of
  the configuration\noptions (or *monitor arguments*) they all share.\n\n### Icon
  patterns\n\nSome monitors allow usage of strings that depend on some integer value\nfrom
  0 to 8 by replacing all occurrences of `\"%%\"` with it\n(i.e. `\"<icon=/path/to/icon_%%.xpm/>\"`
  will be interpreted\nas `\"<icon=/path/to/icon_3.xpm/>\"` when the value is `3`,
  also `\"%\"` is interpreted\nas `\"%\"`, `\"%%\"` as `\"3\"`, `\"%%%\"` as `\"3%\"`,
  `\"%%%%\"` as `\"33\"` and so on). Essentially\nit allows to replace vertical bars
  with custom icons. For example,\n\n    Run Brightness\n      [ \"-t\", \"<ipat>\"\n
  \     , \"--\"\n      , \"--brightness-icon-pattern\", \"<icon=bright_%%.xpm/>\"\n
  \     ] 30\n\nWill display `bright_0.xpm` to `bright_8.xpm` depending on current
  brightness\nvalue.\n\n### Default Monitor Arguments\n\nMonitors accept a common
  set of arguments, described in the first\nsubsection below.  In addition, some monitors
  accept additional options\nthat are specific to them.  When specifying the list
  of arguments in\nyour configuration, the common options come first, followed by
  \"--\",\nfollowed by any monitor-specific options.\n\nThese are the options available
  for all monitors below:\n\n- `-t` _string_  Output template\n    - Template for
  the monitor output. Field names must be enclosed\n      between pointy brackets
  (`<foo>`) and will be substituted by the\n      computed values. You can also specify
  the foreground (and\n      optionally, background) color for a region by bracketing
  it\n      between `<fc=fgcolor>` (or `<fc=fgcolor,bgcolor>`) and\n      `</fc>`.
  The rest of the template is output verbatim.\n    - Long option: `--template`\n
  \   - Default value: per monitor (see above).\n- `-H` _number_ The high threshold.\n
  \   - Numerical values higher than _number_ will be displayed with the\n      color
  specified by `-h` (see below).\n    - Long option: `--High`\n    - Default value:
  66\n- `-L` _number_ The low threshold.\n    - Numerical values higher than _number_
  and lower than the high\n      threshold will be displayed with the color specified
  by `-n`\n      (see below). Values lower than _number_ will use the `-l` color.\n
  \   - Long option: `--Low`\n    - Default value: 33\n- `-h` _color_  High threshold
  color.\n    - Color for displaying values above the high threshold. _color_ can\n
  \     be either a name (e.g. \"blue\") or an hexadecimal RGB (e.g.\n      \"#FF0000\").\n
  \   - Long option: `--high`\n    - Default: none (use the default foreground).\n-
  `-n` _color_  Color for 'normal' values\n    - Color used for values greater than
  the low threshold but lower\n      than the high one.\n    - Long option: `--normal`\n
  \   - Default: none (use the default foreground).\n- `-l` _color_  The low threshold
  color\n    - Color for displaying values below the low threshold.\n    - Long option:
  `--low`\n    - Default: none (use the default foreground).\n- `-S` _boolean_ Display
  optional suffixes\n    - When set to a true designator (\"True\", \"Yes\" or \"On\"),
  optional\n      value suffixes such as the '%' symbol or optional units will be\n
  \     displayed.\n    - Long option: `--suffix`\n    - Default: False.\n- `-p` _number_
  Percentages padding\n    - Width, in number of digits, for quantities representing\n
  \     percentages. For instance `-p 3` means that all percentages\n      in the
  monitor will be represented using 3 digits.\n    - Long option: `--ppad`\n    -
  Default value: 0 (don't pad)\n- `-d` _number_ Decimal digits\n    - Number of digits
  after the decimal period to use in float values.\n    - Long option: `--ddigits`\n
  \   - Default value: 0 (display only integer part)\n- `-m` _number_ Minimum field
  width\n    - Minimum width, in number of characters, of the fields in the\n      monitor
  template. Values whose printed representation is shorter\n      than this value
  will be padded using the padding characters\n      given by the `-c` option with
  the alignment specified by `-a`\n      (see below).\n    - Long option: `--minwidth`\n
  \   - Default: 0\n- `-M` _number_ Maximum field width\n    - Maximum width, in number
  of characters, of the fields in the\n      monitor template. Values whose printed
  representation is longer\n      than this value will be truncated.\n    - Long option:
  `--maxwidth`\n    - Default: 0 (no maximum width)\n- `-e` _string_ Maximum width
  ellipsis\n    - Ellipsis to be added to the field when it has reached its\n      max
  width.\n    - Long option: `--maxwidthellipsis`\n    - Default: \"\" (no ellipsis)\n-
  `-w` _number_ Fixed field width\n    - All fields will be set to this width, padding
  or truncating as\n      needed.\n    - Long option: `--width`\n    - Default: 0
  (variable width)\n- `-T` _number_ Maximum total width\n    - Maximum total width
  of the text.\n    - Long option: `--maxtwidth`\n    - Default: 0 (no limit)\n- `-E`
  _string_ Maximum total width ellipsis\n    - Ellipsis to be added to the total text
  when it has reached\n      its max width.\n    - Long option: `--maxtwidthellipsis`\n
  \   - Default: \"\" (no ellipsis)\n- `-c` _string_\n    - Characters used for padding.
  The characters of _string_ are used\n      cyclically. E.g., with `-P +- -w 6`,
  a field with value \"foo\"\n      will be represented as \"+-+foo\".\n    - Long
  option: `--padchars`\n    - Default value: \" \"\n- `-a` r|l Field alignment\n    -
  Whether to use right (r) or left (l) alignment of field values\n      when padding.\n
  \   - Long option: `--align`\n    - Default value: r (padding to the left)\n- `-b`
  _string_ Bar background\n    - Characters used, cyclically, to draw the background
  of bars.\n      For instance, if you set this option to \"·.\", an empty bar will\n
  \     look like this: `·.·.·.·.·.`\n    - Long option: `--bback`\n    - Default
  value: \":\"\n- `-f` _string_ Bar foreground\n    - Characters used, cyclically,
  to draw the foreground of bars.\n    - Long option: `--bfore`\n    - Default value:
  \"#\"\n- `-W` _number_ Bar width\n    - Total number of characters used to draw
  bars.\n    - Long option: `--bwidth`\n    - Default value: 10\n- `-x` _string_ N/A
  string\n    - String to be used when the monitor is not available\n    - Long option:
  `--nastring`\n    - Default value: \"N/A\"\n\nCommands' arguments must be set as
  a list. E.g.:\n\n    Run Weather \"EGPF\" [\"-t\", \"<station>: <tempC>C\"] 36000\n\nIn
  this case xmobar will run the weather monitor, getting information\nfor the weather
  station ID EGPF (Glasgow Airport, as a homage to GHC)\nevery hour (36000 tenth of
  seconds), with a template that will output\nsomething like:\n\n    Glasgow Airport:
  16.0C\n\n\n### `Uptime Args RefreshRate`\n\n- Aliases to `uptime`\n- Args: default
  monitor arguments. The low and high\n  thresholds refer to the number of days.\n-
  Variables that can be used with the `-t`/`--template` argument:\n  `days`, `hours`,
  `minutes`, `seconds`. The total uptime is the\n  sum of all those fields. You can
  set the `-S` argument to \"True\"\n  to add units to the display of those numeric
  fields.\n- Default template: `Up: <days>d <hours>h <minutes>m`\n\n### `Weather StationID
  Args RefreshRate`\n\n- Aliases to the Station ID: so `Weather \"LIPB\" []` can be
  used in\n  template as `%LIPB%`\n- Thresholds refer to temperature in the selected
  units\n- Args: default monitor arguments\n- Variables that can be used with the
  `-t`/`--template` argument:\n\t    `station`, `stationState`, `year`, `month`, `day`,
  `hour`,\n\t    `windCardinal`, `windAzimuth`, `windMph`, `windKnots`, `windMs`,
  `windKmh`\n        `visibility`, `skyCondition`, `tempC`, `tempF`,\n\t    `dewPointC`,
  `dewPointF`, `rh`, `pressure`\n- Default template: `<station>: <tempC>C, rh <rh>%
  (<hour>)`\n- Retrieves weather information from http://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov.\n\n###
  `WeatherX StationID SkyConditions Args RefreshRate`\n\n- Works in the same way as
  `Weather`, but takes an additional\n  argument, a list of pairs from sky conditions
  to their replacement\n  (typically a unicode string or an icon specification).\n-
  Use the variable `skyConditionS` to display the replacement of the\n  corresponding
  sky condition.  All other `Weather` template variables\n  are available as well.\n\nFor
  example:\n\n```haskell\n  WeatherX \"LEBL\"\n           [ (\"clear\", \"\U0001F323\")\n
  \          , (\"sunny\", \"\U0001F323\")\n           , (\"mostly clear\", \"\U0001F324\")\n
  \          , (\"mostly sunny\", \"\U0001F324\")\n           , (\"partly sunny\",
  \"⛅\")\n           , (\"fair\", \"\U0001F311\")\n           , (\"cloudy\",\"☁\")\n
  \          , (\"overcast\",\"☁\")\n           , (\"partly cloudy\", \"⛅\")\n           ,
  (\"mostly cloudy\", \"\U0001F327\")\n           , (\"considerable cloudiness\",
  \"⛈\")]\n           [\"-t\", \"<fn=2><skyConditionS></fn> <tempC>° <rh>%  <windKmh>
  (<hour>)\"\n           , \"-L\",\"10\", \"-H\", \"25\", \"--normal\", \"black\"\n
  \          , \"--high\", \"lightgoldenrod4\", \"--low\", \"darkseagreen4\"]\n           18000\n```\n\nAs
  mentioned, the replacement string can also be an icon\nspecification, such as `(\"clear\",
  \"<icon=weather-clear.xbm/>\")`.\n\n### `Network Interface Args RefreshRate`\n\n-
  Aliases to the interface name: so `Network \"eth0\" []` can be used as\n  `%eth0%`\n-
  Thresholds refer to velocities expressed in Kb/s\n- Args: default monitor arguments,
  plus:\n  - `--rx-icon-pattern`: dynamic string for reception rate in `rxipat`.\n
  \ - `--tx-icon-pattern`: dynamic string for transmission rate in `txipat`.\n- Variables
  that can be used with the `-t`/`--template` argument:\n  `dev`, `rx`, `tx`, `rxbar`,
  `rxvbar`, `rxipat`, `txbar`, `txvbar`,\n  `txipat`. Reception and transmission rates
  (`rx` and `tx`) are displayed\n  by default as Kb/s, without any suffixes, but you
  can set the `-S` to\n  \"True\" to make them displayed with adaptive units (Kb/s,
  Mb/s, etc.).\n- Default template: `<dev>: <rx>KB|<tx>KB`\n\n### `DynNetwork Args
  RefreshRate`\n\n- Active interface is detected automatically\n- Aliases to \"dynnetwork\"\n-
  Thresholds are expressed in Kb/s\n- Args: default monitor arguments, plus:\n  -
  `--rx-icon-pattern`: dynamic string for reception rate in `rxipat`.\n  - `--tx-icon-pattern`:
  dynamic string for transmission rate in `txipat`.\n- Variables that can be used
  with the `-t`/`--template` argument:\n  `dev`, `rx`, `tx`, `rxbar`, `rxvbar`, `rxipat`,
  `txbar`, `txvbar`,\n  `txipat`. Reception and transmission rates (`rx` and `tx`)
  are displayed\n  in Kbytes per second, and you can set the `-S` to \"True\" to make
  them\n  displayed with units (the string \"Kb/s\").\n- Default template: `<dev>:
  <rx>KB|<tx>KB`\n\n### `Wireless Interface Args RefreshRate`\n\n- If set to \"\",
  the interface is looked up in /proc/net/wireless.\n- Aliases to the interface name
  with the suffix \"wi\": thus, `Wireless\n  \"wlan0\" []` can be used as `%wlan0wi%`,
  and `Wireless \"\" []` as `%wi%`.\n- Args: default monitor arguments, plus:\n  -
  `--quality-icon-pattern`: dynamic string for connection quality in `qualityipat`.\n-
  Variables that can be used with the `-t`/`--template` argument:\n            `essid`,
  `quality`, `qualitybar`, `qualityvbar`, `qualityipat`\n- Thresholds refer to link
  quality in a `[0, 100]` scale\n- Default template: `<essid> <quality>`\n- Requires
  the C library [iwlib] (part of the wireless tools suite)\n  installed in your system.
  In addition, to activate this plugin you\n  must pass `--flags=\"with_iwlib\"` during
  compilation\n\n### `Memory Args RefreshRate`\n\n- Aliases to `memory`\n- Args: default
  monitor arguments, plus:\n  - `--used-icon-pattern`: dynamic string for used memory
  ratio in `usedipat`.\n  - `--free-icon-pattern`: dynamic string for free memory
  ratio in `freeipat`.\n  - `--available-icon-pattern`: dynamic string for available

  in `/sys/class/power_supply/` where to\n  look for the ACPI files of each battery.
  Example:\n  `[\"BAT0\",\"BAT1\",\"BAT2\"]`. Only up to 3 existing directories will
  be\n  searched.\n\n- Args: default monitor arguments, plus the following specific
  ones\n  (these options, being specific to the monitor, are to be specified\n  after
  a `--` in the argument list):\n  - `-O`: string for AC \"on\" status (default: \"On\")\n
  \ - `-i`: string for AC \"idle\" status (default: \"On\")\n  - `-o`: string for
  AC \"off\" status (default: \"Off\")\n  - `-L`: low power (`watts`) threshold (default:
  10)\n  - `-H`: high power threshold (default: 12)\n  - `-l`: color to display power
  lower than the `-L` threshold\n  - `-m`: color to display power lower than the `-H`
  threshold\n  - `-h`: color to display power higher than the `-H` threshold\n  -

  with AC info (default:\n    \"AC/online\")\n  - `-A`: a number between 0 and 100,
  threshold below which the action\n    given by `-a`, if any, is performed (default:
  5)\n  - `-a`: a string with a system command that is run when the\n    percentage
  left in the battery is less or equal than the threshold\n    given by the `-A` option.
  \ If not present, no action is\n    undertaken.\n  - `--on-icon-pattern`: dynamic
  string for current battery charge\n    when AC is \"on\" in `leftipat`.\n  - `--off-icon-pattern`:

  \ - `--idle-icon-pattern`: dynamic string for current battery charge\n    when AC
  is \"idle\" in `leftipat`.\n\n- Variables that can be used with the `-t`/`--template`
  argument:\n\t    `left`, `leftbar`, `leftvbar`, `leftipat`, `timeleft`, `watts`,
  `acstatus`\n- Default template: `Batt: <watts>, <left>% / <timeleft>`\n- Example
  (note that you need \"--\" to separate regular monitor options from\n  Battery's
  specific ones):\n\n         Run BatteryP [\"BAT0\"]\n                      [\"-t\",
  \"<acstatus><watts> (<left>%)\",\n                       \"-L\", \"10\", \"-H\",
  \"80\", \"-p\", \"3\",\n                       \"--\", \"-O\", \"<fc=green>On</fc>
  - \", \"-i\", \"\",\n                       \"-L\", \"-15\", \"-H\", \"-5\",\n                       \"-l\",
  \"red\", \"-m\", \"blue\", \"-h\", \"green\"\n                       \"-a\", \"notify-send
  -u critical 'Battery running out!!'\",\n                       \"-A\", \"3\"]\n
  \                     600\n\n  In the above example, the thresholds before the \"--\"
  separator\n  affect only the `<left>` and `<leftbar>` fields, while those after\n
  \ the separator affect how `<watts>` is displayed. For this monitor,\n  neither
  the generic nor the specific options have any effect on\n  `<timeleft>`.  We are
  also telling the monitor to execute the unix\n  command `notify-send` when the percentage
  left in the battery\n  reaches 6%.\n\n  It is also possible to specify template
  variables in the `-O` and\n  `-o` switches, as in the following example:\n\n         Run
  BatteryP [\"BAT0\"]\n                      [\"-t\", \"<acstatus>\"\n                      ,
  \"-L\", \"10\", \"-H\", \"80\"\n                      , \"-l\", \"red\", \"-h\",
  \"green\"\n                      , \"--\", \"-O\", \"Charging\", \"-o\", \"Battery:
  <left>%\"\n                      ] 10\n\n- The \"idle\" AC state is selected whenever
  the AC power entering the\n  battery is zero.\n\n### `BatteryN Dirs Args RefreshRate

  happen on systems with a pulseaudio backend.\n- Default template: `Vol: <volume>%
  <status>`\n- Requires the package [alsa-core] and [alsa-mixer] installed in your\n
  \ system. In addition, to activate this plugin you must pass\n  `--flags=\"with_alsa\"`
  during compilation.\n\n### `Alsa Mixer Element Args`\n\nLike [Volume](#volume-mixer-element-args-refreshrate),
  but with the following differences:\n- Uses event-based refreshing via `alsactl
  monitor` instead of polling, so it will refresh\n  instantly when there's a volume
  change, and won't use CPU until a change happens.\n- Aliases to `alsa:` followed
  by the mixer name and element name separated by a colon. Thus,\n  `Alsa \"default\"
  \"Master\" []` can be used as `%alsa:default:Master%`.\n- Additional options (after
  the `--`):\n    - `--alsactl=/path/to/alsactl`\n        - If this option is not
  specified, `alsactl` will be sought in your `PATH`\n          first, and failing
  that, at `/usr/sbin/alsactl` (this is its location on\n          Debian systems.
  `alsactl monitor` works as a non-root user despite living\n          in `/usr/sbin`.).\n-
  `stdbuf` (from coreutils) must be (and most probably already is) in your `PATH`.\n\n###
  `MPD Args RefreshRate`\n\n- This monitor will only be compiled if you ask for it
  using the\n  `with_mpd` flag. It needs [libmpd] 5.0 or later (available on Hackage).\n-

  and `MPD_PORT` are used to configure the\n  mpd server to communicate with. Also
  available:\n  - `lapsed-icon-pattern`: dynamic string for current track position
  in `ipat`.\n- Variables that can be used with the `-t`/`--template` argument:\n
  \            `bar`, `vbar`, `ipat`, `state`, `statei`, `volume`, `length`,\n             `lapsed`,
  `remaining`,\n             `plength` (playlist length), `ppos` (playlist position),\n
  \            `flags` (ncmpcpp-style playback mode),\n             `name`, `artist`,
  `composer`, `performer`,\n             `album`, `title`, `track`, `file`, `genre`,
  `date`\n- Default template: `MPD: <state>`\n- Example (note that you need \"--\"

  mail counts\n- Paths may start with a '~' to expand to the user's home directory.\n-
  This plugin requires inotify support in your Linux kernel and the\n  [hinotify]
  package. To activate, pass `--flags=\"with_inotify\"`\n  during compilation.\n-
  Example. The following command look for mails in `/var/mail/inbox`\n  and `~/foo/mbox`,
  and will put a space in front of the printed string\n  (when it's not empty); it
  can be used in the template with the alias\n  `mbox`:\n\n         Run MBox [(\"I
  \", \"inbox\", \"red\"), (\"O \", \"~/foo/mbox\", \"\")]\n                  [\"-d\",
  \"/var/mail/\", \"-p\", \" \"] \"mbox\"\n\n### `XPropertyLog PropName`\n\n- Aliases
  to `PropName`\n- Reads the X property named by `PropName` (a string) and displays
  its\n  value. The [examples/xmonadpropwrite.hs script] in xmobar's\n  distribution
  can be used to set the given property from the output\n  of any other program or
  script.\n\n[examples/xmonadpropwrite.hs script]: https://github.com/jaor/xmobar/raw/master/examples/xmonadpropwrite.hs\n\n###
  `UnsafeXPropertyLog PropName`\n\n- Aliases to `PropName`\n- Same as `XPropertyLog`,
  but the input is not filtered to avoid\n  injection of actions (cf. `UnsafeXMonadLog`).
  \ The program writing\n  the value of the read property is responsible of performing
  any\n  needed cleanups.\n\n### `NamedXPropertyLog PropName Alias`\n\n- Aliases to
  `Alias`\n- Same as `XPropertyLog`, but a custom alias can be specified.\n\n### `NamedXPropertyLog
  PropName Alias`\n\n- Aliases to `Alias`\n- Same as `UnsafeXPropertyLog`, but a custom
  alias can be specified.\n\n### `Brightness Args RefreshRate`\n\n- Aliases to `bright`\n-
  Args: default monitor arguments, plus the following specif ones:\n    - `-D`: directory
  in `/sys/class/backlight/` with files in it\n       (default: \"acpi_video0\")\n
  \   - `-C`: file with the current brightness (default:\n       actual_brightness)\n
  \   - `-M`: file with the maximum brightness (default:\n       max_brightness)\n
  \   - `--brightness-icon-pattern`: dynamic string for current brightness in `ipat`.\n-
  Variables that can be used with the `-t`/`--template` argument:\n\t    `vbar`, `percent`,
  `bar`, `ipat`\n- Default template: `<percent>`\n- Example:\n\n       Run Brightness
  [\"-t\", \"<bar>\"] 60\n\n### `Kbd Opts`\n\n- Registers to XKB/X11-Events and output
  the currently active keyboard layout.\n  Supports replacement of layout names.\n-
  Aliases to `kbd`\n- Opts is a list of tuples:\n    -  first element of the tuple
  is the search string\n    -  second element of the tuple is the corresponding replacement\n-
  Example:\n\n\t\tRun Kbd [(\"us(dvorak)\", \"DV\"), (\"us\", \"US\")]\n\n### `Locks`\n\n-
  Displays the status of Caps Lock, Num Lock and Scroll Lock.\n- Aliases to `locks`\n-
  Example:\n\n\tRun Locks\n\n### `CatInt n filename`\n\n- Reads and displays an integer
  from the file whose path is `filename`\n  (especially useful with files in `/sys`).\n-
  Aliases as `catn` (e.g. `Cat 0` as `cat0`, etc.) so you can\n  have several.\n-
  Example:\n\n    Run CatInt 0 \"/sys/devices/platform/thinkpad_hwmon/fan1_input\"
  [] 50\n\n### `UVMeter`\n\n- Aliases to \"uv \" + station id. For example: `%uv brisbane%`
  or `%uv\n  alice springs%`\n- Args: default monitor arguments.\n\n- *Reminder:*
  Keep the refresh rate high, to avoid making unnecessary\n  requests every time the
  plug-in is run.\n- Station IDs can be found here:\n  http://www.arpansa.gov.au/uvindex/realtime/xml/uvvalues.xml\n-
  Example:\n\n        Run UVMeter \"brisbane\" [\"-H\", \"3\", \"-L\", \"3\", \"--low\",
  \"green\", \"--high\", \"red\"] 900\n\n## Executing External Commands\n\nIn order
  to execute an external command you can either write the\ncommand name in the template,
  in this case it will be executed without\narguments, or you can configure it in
  the \"commands\" configuration\noption list with the Com template command:\n\n`Com
  ProgramName Args Alias RefreshRate`\n\n- ProgramName: the name of the program\n-
  Args: the arguments to be passed to the program at execution time\n- RefreshRate:
  number of tenths of second between re-runs of the\n  command. A zero or negative
  rate means that the command will be\n  executed only once.\n- Alias: a name to be
  used in the template. If the alias is en empty\n  string the program name can be
  used in the template.\n\nE.g.:\n\n        Run Com \"uname\" [\"-s\",\"-r\"] \"\"
  0\n\ncan be used in the output template as `%uname%` (and xmobar will call\n_uname_
  only once), while\n\n        Run Com \"date\" [\"+\\\"%a %b %_d %H:%M\\\"\"] \"mydate\"
  600\n\ncan be used in the output template as `%mydate%`.\n\nSometimes, you don't
  mind if the command executed exits with an error,\nor you might want to display
  a custom message in that case.  To that\nend, you can use the `ComX` variant:\n\n`ComX
  ProgramName Args ExitMessage Alias RefreshRate`\n\nWorks like `Com`, but displaying
  `ExitMessage` (a string) if the\nexecution fails.  For instance:\n\n        Run
  ComX \"date\" [\"+\\\"%a %b %_d %H:%M\\\"\"] \"N/A\" \"mydate\" 600\n\nwill display
  \"N/A\" if for some reason the `date` invocation fails.\n\n## Other Plugins\n\n<font
  size=\"+1\">**`StdinReader`**</font>\n\n- Aliases to StdinReader\n- Displays any
  text received by xmobar on its standard input.\n- Strips actions from the text received.
  \ This means you can't pass dynamic\n  actions via stdin.  This is safer than `UnsafeStdinReader`
  because there is\n  no need to escape the content before passing it to xmobar's
  standard input.\n\n<font size=\"+1\">**`UnsafeStdinReader`**</font>\n\n- Aliases
  to UnsafeStdinReader\n- Displays any text received by xmobar on its standard input.\n-
  Will not do anything to the text received.  This means you can pass dynamic\n  actions
  via stdin.  Be careful to remove tags from dynamic text that you\n  pipe-thru to
  xmobar's standard input, e.g. window's title.  There is no way\n  to escape the
  tags, i.e. you can't print a literal `<action>` tag as a text\n  on xmobar.\n- Sample
  usage: send to xmobar's stdin the list of your workspaces enclosed by\n  actions
  tags that switches the workspaces to be able to switch workspaces by\n  clicking
  on xmobar:\n  ```<action=`xdotool key alt+1`>ws1</action> <action=`xdotool key alt+1`>ws2</action>```\n\n<font
  size=\"+1\">**`Date Format Alias RefreshRate`**</font>\n\n- Format is a time format
  string, as accepted by the standard ISO C\n  `strftime` function (or Haskell's `formatCalendarTime`).\n-
  Sample usage: `Run Date \"%a %b %_d %Y <fc=#ee9a00>%H:%M:%S</fc>\" \"date\" 10`\n\n<font
  size=\"+1\">**`DateZone Format Locale Zone Alias RefreshRate`**</font>\n\n- Format
  is a time format string, as accepted by the standard ISO C\n  `strftime` function
  (or Haskell's `formatCalendarTime`).\n- If Locale is \"\" the default locale of
  the system is used, otherwise the given\n  locale. If there are more instances of
  DateZone, using \"\" as input for Locale\n  is not recommended.\n- Zone is the name
  of the TimeZone. It is assumed that the tz database is stored\n  in /usr/share/zoneinfo/.
  If \"\" is given as Zone, the default system time is\n  used.\n- Sample usage:\n
  \ `Run DateZone \"%a %H:%M:%S\" \"de_DE.UTF-8\" \"Europe/Vienna\" \"viennaTime\"
  10`\n\n<font size=\"+1\">**`CommandReader \"/path/to/program\" Alias`**</font>\n\n-
  Runs the given program, and displays its standard output.\n\n<font size=\"+1\">**`PipeReader
  \"default text:/path/to/pipe\" Alias`**</font>\n\n- Reads its displayed output from
  the given pipe.\n- Prefix an optional default text separated by a colon\n- Expands
  environment variables in the first argument of syntax '${VAR}' or '$VAR'\n\n<font
  size=\"+1\">**`MarqueePipeReader \"default text:/path/to/pipe\" (length, rate, sep)
  Alias`**</font>\n\n- Generally equivalent to PipeReader\n- Text is displayed as
  marquee with the specified length, rate in 10th\n  seconds and separator when it
  wraps around\n\n        Run MarqueePipeReader \"/tmp/testpipe\" (10, 7, \"+\") \"mpipe\"\n\n-
  Expands environment variables in the first argument\n\n<font size=\"+1\">\n**`BufferedPipeReader
  Alias [(Timeout, Bool, \"/path/to/pipe1\"), ..]`**\n</font>\n\n- Display data from
  multiple pipes.\n- Timeout (in tenth of seconds) is the value after which the previous\n
  \ content is restored i.e. if there was already something from a\n  previous pipe
  it will be put on display again, overwriting the\n  current status.\n- A pipe with
  Timeout of 0 will be displayed permanently, just like\n  `PipeReader`\n- The boolean
  option indicates whether new data for this pipe should\n  make xmobar appear (unhide,
  reveal). In this case, the Timeout\n  additionally specifies when the window should
  be hidden again. The\n  output is restored in any case.\n- Use it for OSD-like status
  bars e.g. for setting the volume or\n  brightness:\n\n        Run BufferedPipeReader
  \"bpr\"\n            [ (  0, False, \"/tmp/xmobar_window\"  )\n            , ( 15,
  \ True, \"/tmp/xmobar_status\"  )\n            ]\n\n  Have your window manager send
  window titles to\n  `\"/tmp/xmobar_window\"`. They will always be shown and not
  reveal\n  your xmobar.  Sending some status information to\n  `\"/tmp/xmobar_status\"`
  will reveal xmonad for 1.5 seconds and\n  temporarily overwrite the window titles.\n-
  Take a look at [examples/status.sh]\n- Expands environment variables for the pipe
  path\n\n[examples/status.sh]: http://github.com/jaor/xmobar/raw/master/examples/status.sh\n\n\n<font
  size=\"+1\">**`XMonadLog`**</font>\n\n- Aliases to XMonadLog\n- Displays information
  from xmonad's `_XMONAD_LOG`. You can set this\n  property by using `xmonadPropLog`
  as your log hook in xmonad's\n  configuration, as in the following example (more
  info [here]):\n\n        main = do\n          spawn \"xmobar\"\n          xmonad
  $ defaultConfig {\n            logHook = dynamicLogString defaultPP >>= xmonadPropLog\n
  \         }\n   This plugin can be used as a sometimes more convenient alternative\n
  \  to `StdinReader`. For instance, it allows you to (re)start xmobar\n   outside
  xmonad.\n\n[here]: http://xmonad.org/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Hooks-DynamicLog.html\n\n<font
  size=\"+1\">**`UnsafeXMonadLog`**</font>\n\n- Aliases to UnsafeXMonadLog\n- Similar
  to StdinReader versus UnsafeStdinReader, this does not strip `<action\n  ...>` tags
  from XMonad's `_XMONAD_LOG`.\n- It is advised that you still use `xmobarStrip` for
  the ppTitle in your\n  logHook:\n\n        myPP = defaultPP { ppTitle = xmobarStrip
  }\n        main = xmonad $ defaultConfig {\n          logHook = dynamicLogString
  myPP >>= xmonadPropLog\n        }\n\n# Plugins\n\n## Writing a Plugin\n\nWriting
  a plugin for xmobar should be very simple. You need to create\na data type with
  at least one constructor.\n\nNext you must declare this data type an instance of
  the `Exec` class, by\ndefining the 1 needed method (alternatively `start` or `run`)
  and 2\noptional ones (alias and rate):\n\n        start :: e -> (String -> IO ())
  -> IO ()\n        run   :: e -> IO String\n        rate  :: e -> Int\n        alias
  :: e -> String\n\n`start` must receive a callback to be used to display the `String`\nproduced
  by the plugin. This method can be used for plugins that need\nto perform asynchronous
  actions. See\n`src/Xmobar/Plugins/PipeReader.hs` for an example.\n\n`run` can be
  used for simpler plugins. If you define only `run` the\nplugin will be run every
  second. To overwrite this default you just\nneed to implement `rate`, which must
  return the number of tenth of\nseconds between every successive runs. See `examples/xmobar.hs`
  for an\nexample of a plugin that runs just once, and\n`src/Xmobar/Plugins/Date.hs`
  for one that implements `rate`.\n\nNotice that Date could be implemented as:\n\n
  \       instance Exec Date where\n            alias (Date _ a _) = a\n            start
  (Date f _ r) = date f r\n\n        date :: String -> Int -> (String -> IO ()) ->
  IO ()\n        date format r callback = do go\n            where go = do\n                    t
  <- toCalendarTime =<< getClockTime\n                    callback $ formatCalendarTime
  defaultTimeLocale format t\n                    tenthSeconds r >> go\n\nThis implementation
  is equivalent to the one you can read in\n`Plugins/Date.hs`.\n\n`alias` is the name
  to be used in the output template. Default alias\nwill be the data type constructor.\n\nAfter
  that your type constructor can be used as an argument for the\nRunnable type constructor
  `Run` in the `commands` list of the\nconfiguration options.\n\n## Using a Plugin\n\nTo
  use your new plugin, you need to use a pure Haskell configuration\nfor xmobar, and
  load your definitions there.  You can see an example\nin [examples/xmobar.hs](./examples/xmobar.hs)
  showing you how to write\na Haskell configuration that uses a new plugin, all in
  one file.\n\nWhen xmobar runs with the full path to that Haskell file as its\nargument
  (or if you put it in `~/.config/xmobar/xmobar.hs`), and with\nthe xmobar library
  installed, the Haskell code will be compiled as\nneeded, and the new executable
  spawned for you.\n\nThat's it!\n\n## Configurations written in pure Haskell\n\nxmobar
  can be used as a pure Haskell program, that is compiled with\nyour specific configuration,
  expressed as Haskell source code.  For an\nexample, see [the author's\nconfiguration](https://gitlab.com/jaor/xmobar-config/).\n\n#
