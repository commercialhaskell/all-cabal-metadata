changelog: ! "# Change Log / Release Notes\n\n## 0.13 (February 10, 2017)\n\n### Breaking
  Changes\n\n  * The type of `completionKey` (of `XPConfig` record) has been\n    changed
  from `KeySym` to `(KeyMask, KeySym)`. The default value\n    for this is still bound
  to the `Tab` key.\n\n  * New constructor `CenteredAt Rational Rational` added for\n
  \   `XMonad.Prompt.XPPosition`.\n\n  * `XMonad.Prompt` now stores its history file
  in the XMonad cache\n    directory in a file named `prompt-history`.\n\n### New
  Modules\n\n  * `XMonad.Layout.SortedLayout`\n\n    A new LayoutModifier that sorts
  a given layout by a list of\n    properties. The order of properties in the list
  determines\n    the order of windows in the final layout. Any unmatched windows\n
  \   go to the end of the order.\n\n  * `XMonad.Prompt.Unicode`\n\n    A prompt to
  search a unicode character by its name, and put it into the\n    clipboard.\n\n
  \ * `XMonad.Util.Ungrab`\n\n    Release xmonad's keyboard and pointer grabs immediately,
  so\n    screen grabbers and lock utilities, etc. will work. Replaces\n    the short
  sleep hackaround.\n\n  * `XMonad.Util.Loggers.NamedScratchpad`\n\n    A collection
  of Loggers (see `XMonad.Util.Loggers`) for NamedScratchpads\n    (see `XMonad.Util.NamedScratchpad`).\n\n
  \ * `XMonad.Util.NoTaskbar`\n\n    Utility function and `ManageHook` to mark a window
  to be ignored by\n    EWMH taskbars and pagers. Useful for `NamedScratchpad` windows,
  since\n    you will usually be taken to the `NSP` workspace by them.\n\n### Bug
  Fixes and Minor Changes\n\n  * `XMonad.Hooks.ManageDocks`,\n\n    - Fix a very annoying
  bug where taskbars/docs would be\n      covered by windows.\n\n    - Also fix a
  bug that caused certain Gtk and Qt application to\n      have issues displaying
  menus and popups.\n\n  * `XMonad.Layout.LayoutBuilder`\n\n    Merge all functionality
  from `XMonad.Layout.LayoutBuilderP` into\n    `XMonad.Layout.LayoutBuilder`.\n\n
  \ * `XMonad.Actions.WindowGo`\n\n    - Fix `raiseNextMaybe` cycling between 2 workspaces
  only.\n\n  * `XMonad.Actions.UpdatePointer`\n\n    - Fix bug when cursor gets stuck
  in one of the corners.\n\n  * `XMonad.Actions.Submap`\n\n    Establish pointer grab
  to avoid freezing X, when button press occurs after\n    submap key press.  And
  terminate submap at button press in the same way,\n    as we do for wrong key press.\n\n
  \ * `XMonad.Actions.DynamicProjects`\n\n    - Switching away from a dynamic project
  that contains no windows\n      automatically deletes that project's workspace.\n\n
  \     The project itself was already being deleted, this just deletes\n      the
  workspace created for it as well.\n\n    - Added function to change the working
  directory (`changeProjectDirPrompt`)\n\n    - All of the prompts are now multiple
  mode prompts.  Try using the\n      `changeModeKey` in a prompt and see what happens!\n\n##
  0.12 (December 14, 2015)\n\n### Breaking Changes\n\n  * `XMonad.Actions.UpdatePointer.updatePointer`
  arguments were\n    changed. This allows including aspects of both of the\n    `TowardsCentre`
  and `Relative` methods. To keep the same behavior,\n    replace the entry in the
  left column with the entry on the right:\n\n    | < 0.12                              |
  \  >= 0.12                        |\n    |-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n
  \   | `updatePointer Nearest`             | `updatePointer (0.5, 0.5) (1,1)` |\n
  \   | `updatePointer (Relative x y)`      | `updatePointer (x,y) (0,0)`      |\n
  \   | `updatePointer (TowardsCentre x y)` | `updatePointer (0.5,0.5) (x,y)`  |\n\n###
  New Modules\n\n  * `XMonad.Actions.AfterDrag`\n\n    Perform an action after the
  current mouse drag is completed.\n\n  * `XMonad.Actions.DynamicProjects`\n\n    Imbues
  workspaces with additional features so they can be treated\n    as individual project
  areas.\n\n  * `XMonad.Actions.LinkWorkspaces`\n\n    Provides bindings to add and
  delete links between workspaces. It\n    is aimed at providing useful links between
  workspaces in a\n    multihead setup. Linked workspaces are viewed at the same time.\n\n
  \ * `XMonad.Config.Bepo`\n\n    This module fixes some of the keybindings for the
  francophone\n    among you who use a BEPO keyboard layout. Based on\n    `XMonad.Config.Azerty`\n\n
  \ * `XMonad.Config.Dmwit`\n\n    Daniel Wagner's configuration.\n\n  * `XMonad.Config.Mate`\n\n
  \   This module provides a config suitable for use with the MATE\n    desktop environment.\n\n
  \ * `XMonad.Config.Prime`\n\n    A draft of a brand new config syntax for xmonad.\n\n
  \ * `XMonad.Hooks.DynamicProperty`\n\n    Module to apply a `ManageHook` to an already-mapped
  window when a\n    property changes. This would commonly be used to match browser\n
  \   windows by title, since the final title will only be set after (a)\n    the
  window is mapped, (b) its document has been loaded, (c) all\n    load-time scripts
  have run.\n\n  * `XMonad.Hooks.ManageDebug`\n\n    A `manageHook` and associated
  `logHook` for debugging `ManageHook`s.\n    Simplest usage: wrap your xmonad config
  in the `debugManageHook`\n    combinator.  Or use `debugManageHookOn` for a triggerable
  version,\n    specifying the triggering key sequence in `XMonad.Util.EZConfig`\n
  \   syntax. Or use the individual hooks in whatever way you see fit.\n\n  * `XMonad.Hooks.WallpaperSetter`\n\n
  \   Log hook which changes the wallpapers depending on visible\n    workspaces.\n\n
  \ * `XMonad.Hooks.WorkspaceHistory`\n\n    Keeps track of workspace viewing order.\n\n
  \ * `XMonad.Layout.AvoidFloats`\n\n    Find a maximum empty rectangle around floating
  windows and use\n    that area to display non-floating windows.\n\n  * `XMonad.Layout.BinarySpacePartition`\n\n
  \   Layout where new windows will split the focused window in half,\n    based off
  of BSPWM.\n\n  * `XMonad.Layout.Dwindle`\n\n    Three layouts: The first, `Spiral`,
  is a reimplementation of\n    `XMonad.Layout.Spiral.spiral` with, at least to me,
  more intuitive\n    semantics.  The second, `Dwindle`, is inspired by a similar
  layout\n    in awesome and produces the same sequence of decreasing window\n    sizes
  as Spiral but pushes the smallest windows into a screen\n    corner rather than
  the centre.  The third, `Squeeze` arranges all\n    windows in one row or in one
  column, with geometrically decreasing\n    sizes.\n\n  * `XMonad.Layout.Hidden`\n\n
  \   Similar to `XMonad.Layout.Minimize` but completely removes windows\n    from
  the window set so `XMonad.Layout.BoringWindows` isn't\n    necessary.  Perfect companion
  to `XMonad.Layout.BinarySpacePartition`\n    since it can be used to move windows
  to another part of the BSP tree.\n\n  * `XMonad.Layout.IfMax`\n\n    Provides `IfMax`
  layout, which will run one layout if there are\n    maximum `N` windows on workspace,
  and another layout, when number\n    of windows is greater than `N`.\n\n  * `XMonad.Layout.PerScreen`\n\n
  \   Configure layouts based on the width of your screen; use your\n    favorite
  multi-column layout for wide screens and a full-screen\n    layout for small ones.\n\n
  \ * `XMonad.Layout.Stoppable`\n\n    This module implements a special kind of layout
  modifier, which when\n    applied to a layout, causes xmonad to stop all non-visible
  processes.\n    In a way, this is a sledge-hammer for applications that drain power.\n
  \   For example, given a web browser on a stoppable workspace, once the\n    workspace
  is hidden the web browser will be stopped.\n\n  * `XMonad.Prompt.ConfirmPrompt`\n\n
  \   A module for setting up simple confirmation prompts for\n    keybindings.\n\n
  \ * `XMonad.Prompt.Pass`\n\n    This module provides 3 `XMonad.Prompt`s to ease
  passwords\n    manipulation (generate, read, remove) via [pass][].\n\n  * `XMonad.Util.RemoteWindows`\n\n
  \   This module implements a proper way of finding out whether the\n    window is
  remote or local.\n\n  * `XMonad.Util.SpawnNamedPipe`\n\n    A module for spawning
  a pipe whose `Handle` lives in the xmonad state.\n\n  * `XMonad.Util.WindowState`\n\n
  \   Functions for saving per-window data.\n\n### Miscellaneous Changes\n\n  * Fix
  issue #9: `XMonad.Prompt.Shell` `searchPredicate` is ignored,\n    defaults to `isPrefixOf`\n\n
  \ * Fix moveHistory when alwaysHighlight is enabled\n\n  * `XMonad.Actions.DynamicWorkspaceGroups`
  now exports `addRawWSGroup`\n\n  * Side tabs were added to the tabbed layout\n\n
  \ * `XMonad/Layout/IndependentScreens` now exports `marshallSort`\n\n  * `XMonad/Hooks/UrgencyHook`
  now exports `clearUrgency`\n\n  * Exceptions are now caught when finding commands
  on `PATH` in `Prompt.Shell`\n\n  * Switched to `Data.Default` wherever possible\n\n
  \ * `XMonad.Layout.IndependentScreens` now exports `whenCurrentOn`\n\n  * `XMonad.Util.NamedActions`
  now exports `addDescrKeys'`\n\n  * EWMH `DEMANDS_ATTENTION` support added to `UrgencyHook`\n\n
  \ * New `useTransientFor` modifier in `XMonad.Layout.TrackFloating`\n\n  * Added
  the ability to remove arbitrary workspaces\n\n## 0.9 (October 26, 2009)\n\n### Updates
  that Require Changes in `xmonad.hs`\n\n  * `XMonad.Hooks.EwmhDesktops` no longer
  uses `layoutHook`, the\n    `ewmhDesktopsLayout` modifier has been removed from\n
  \   xmonad-contrib. It uses `logHook`, `handleEventHook`, and\n    `startupHook`
  instead and provides a convenient function `ewmh` to\n    add EWMH support to a
  `defaultConfig`.\n\n  * Most `DynamicLog` users can continue with configs unchanged,
  but\n    users of the quickbar functions `xmobar` or `dzen` will need to\n    change
  `xmonad.hs`: their types have changed to allow easier\n    composition with other
  `XConfig` modifiers. The `dynamicLogDzen`\n    and `dynamicLogXmobar` functions
  have been removed.\n\n  * `WindowGo` or `safeSpawn` users may need to change command
  lines\n    due to `safeSpawn` changes.\n\n  * People explicitly referencing the
  \"SP\" scratchpad workspace should\n    change it to \"NSP\" which is also used
  by the new\n    `Util.NamedScratchpad` module.\n\n  * (Optional) People who explicitly
  use `swapMaster` in key or mouse\n    bindings should change it to `shiftMaster`.
  It's the current\n    default used where `swapMaster` had been used previously.
  It works\n    better than `swapMaster` when using floating and tiled windows\n    together
  on the same workspace.\n\n## See Also\n\n<https://wiki.haskell.org/Xmonad/Notable_changes_since_0.8>\n\n[pass]:
