    xmonad-contrib : third party extensions to the xmonad window manager

                             http://xmonad.org

      You need the ghc compiler and xmonad window manager installed in
      order to use these extensions.

      For installation and configuration instructions, please see the
      xmonad website, the documents included with the xmonad source
      distribution, and online haddock documentation:

      http://www.xmonad.org/xmonad-docs

  Changelogs

      For a list of changes since the 0.8.x releases, see:

  http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Notable_changes_since_0.8

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Updates to XMonadContrib-0.9 that may Require Changes to ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs

      Please see the Changelogs and xmonad-contrib haddock documentation
      links for further details regarding the following changes.

      * XMonad.Hooks.EwmhDesktops no longer uses layoutHook, the
      ewmhDesktopsLayout modifier has been removed from xmonad-contrib. It
      uses logHook, handleEventHook, and startupHook instead and provides
      a convenient function 'ewmh' to add EWMH support to a defaultConfig.

      * Most DynamicLog users can continue with configs unchanged, but users
      of the quickbar functions 'xmobar' or 'dzen' will need to change
      xmonad.hs: their types have changed to allow easier composition with
      other XConfig modifiers. The 'dynamicLogDzen' and 'dynamicLogXmobar'
      functions have been removed.

      * WindowGo or safeSpawn users may need to change command lines due to
      safeSpawn changes.

      * People explicitly referencing the "SP" scratchpad workspace should
      change it to "NSP" which is also used by the new Util.NamedScratchpad.

      * (Optional) People who explicitly use swapMaster in key or mouse
      bindings should change it to shiftMaster. It's the current default
      used where swapMaster had been used previously. It works better than
      swapMaster when using floating and tiled windows together on the
      same workspace.

  Contributing

      Haskell code contributed to this repo should live under the
      appropriate subdivision of the 'XMonad.' namespace (currently
      includes Actions, Config, Hooks, Layout, Prompt, and Util). For
      example, to use the Grid layout, one would import:

          XMonad.Layout.Grid
