  # About

  *iwlib* is a thin wrapper over the *iw* C library, providing access to
  wireless card information in supported systems.

  # Bug Reports

  To submit bug reports you can use the [bug tracker over at Codeberg].

  # Installation

  ## Using cabal-install

  iwlib is available from [Hackage], and you can install it using
  `cabal-install`:

          cabal install iwlib

  ## From source

  If you don't have `cabal-install` installed, you can get iwlib's
  source code in a variety of ways:

    - From [Hackage]. Just download the latest release from xmobar's
      hackage page.
    - From [Codeberg]. You can also obtain a tarball in [Codeberg's
      downloads page]. You'll find there links to each tagged release.
    - From the bleeding edge repo. If you prefer to live dangerously,
      just get the latest and greatest (and buggiest, I guess) using
      git:

          git clone git://codeberg.org/jao/iwlib


  [Codeberg's downloads page]: https://github.com/jaor/iwlib/downloads

  If you have cabal installed, you can now use it from within its source
  tree:

          cabal install


  Otherwise, run the configure script:

          runhaskell Setup.lhs configure

  Now you can build the source:

          runhaskell Setup.lhs build
          runhaskell Setup.lhs install # possibly to be run as root

  # External dependencies

  No other Haskell library is required, but you will need the [iwlib] C
  library and headers in your system (e.g., install `libiw-dev` in
  Debian-based systems or `wireless_tools` on Arch Linux).

  # Authors

  This library is written and maintaned by Jose Antonio Ortega Ruiz.

  # Thanks

  Many thanks to Leif Warner for suggesting the creation of this library
  and providing the initial hackage scaffolding.
