description: "4Blocks is a tetris-like game implemented in Haskell and Gtk2hs for
  an AI project.\r\n\r\nSome notes:\r\n- The game currently works only with GHC 6.8.3
  due to its use of Gtk2hs 0.9.13.\r\n- I haven't tested with anything later but it
  is likely to fail due the fact that \r\n  later versions of Gtk2hs have a different
  system of handling events.\r\n- To make this project compatible with later versions
  of GHC and Gtk2hs two changes are required:\r\n    - Remove the function \"permutations\"
  which was copied from a later GHC base library\r\n    - Alter key-event handling
  to the version used by later Gtk2hs: some functions (in CommandKeys.hs)\r\n      were
  simply introduced in order to disallow some of the keys used in the game (namely
  rotation) to trigger\r\n      continuously when a key is held pressed. I believe
  this kind of behaviour can be managed automatically\r\n      with Gtk2hs' new event
  handling mechanism, however I haven't had time to recode accordingly myself.\r\n-
  I hope to write a patch for this in the near future.\r\n\r\nTo play:\r\n- [1]          Starts
  a Game\r\n- [P]          Pause/Resume Game\r\n- [Esc]        Exit Game\r\n- [A]/[Left]
  \  Shift Left\r\n- [D]/[Right]  Shift Right\r\n- [W]/[Up]     Hard Drop\r\n- [S]/[Down]
  \  Soft Drop\r\n- [Q]/[,]      Rotate Left\r\n- [E]/[.]      Rotate Right\r\n\r\nSome
  gameplay features to add in the future:\r\n- T-spin points\r\n- Wall-kick\r\n- Sounds!\r\n\r\nFinally:\r\n-
  Feel free to criticize (constructively) my code as this has been my first real forray
  into Haskell.\r\n- Email me on drewcalleja@gmail.com :) \r\n- Enjoy!"
