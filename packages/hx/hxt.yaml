description: |-
  The Haskell XML Toolbox bases on the ideas of HaXml and HXML,
  but introduces a more general approach for processing XML with Haskell.
  The Haskell XML Toolbox uses a generic data model for representing XML documents,
  including the DTD subset and the document subset, in Haskell.
  It contains a validating XML parser, a HTML parser, namespace support,
  an XPath expression evaluator, an XSLT library, a RelaxNG schema validator
  and funtions for serialization and deserialization of user defined data.
  The library makes extensive use of the arrow approach for processing XML.
  Since version 9 the toolbox is partitioned into various (sub-)packages.
  This package contains the core functionality,
  hxt-curl, hxt-tagsoup, hxt-relaxng, hxt-xpath, hxt-xslt,
  hxt-regex-xmlschema contain the extensions.
  hxt-unicode contains encoding and decoding functions,
  hxt-charproperties char properties for unicode and XML.
