description: |-
  Cipher-aes128 is an implementation of AES and common modes of operation.  It borrows Hanquez's C AES code (see 'cipher-aes') but
  is unique due to including compile-time detection of
  NI compiler support, a slightly more functional interface
  for GCM operations, exposure of 'Ptr' based operations via the .Internal module, and build-in crypto-api support.
  Cipher-aes128 was originally developed as "'cipher-aes' plus trampolines", which has since been adopted into cipher-aes.
