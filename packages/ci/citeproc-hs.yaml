  % citeproc-hs - A Haskell Implementation of the Citation Style Language
  % Andrea Rossato

  About
  -----

  [citeproc-hs] is a [Haskell] implementation of the Citation Style
  Language ([CSL]).

  [citeproc-hs] adds to [pandoc], the famous [Haskell] text processing
  tool, a Bibtex like citation and bibliographic formatting and
  generation facility.

  [CSL] is an XML language for specifying citation and bibliographic
  formatting, similar in principle to BibTeX `.bst` files or the binary
  style files in commercial products like Endnote or Reference Manager.

  [CSL] is used by [Zotero] for bibliographic style formatting, and the
  huge number of [CSL] styles developed by the [Zotero] community can
  can be downloaded from here:

  <http://www.zotero.org/styles>

  There are plans to use CSL for adding bibliographic support to future
  releases of [OpenOffice](http://bibliographic.openoffice.org/).

  [citeproc-hs] can process and format citations according to a [CSL]
  style, given a collection of references.

  Natively [citeproc-hs] can read [JSON][^1] and [MODS][^2] XML
  formatted bibliographic databases.

  [bibutils] can be used to convert Bibtex and other bibliographic
  databases to [MODS] collections, which can be thus read by
  [citeproc-hs].

  [bibutils] also exports a library and this library can be used by
  [citeproc-hs] for reading the most widely used bibliographic
  databases. This requires the installation of [hs-bibutils], the
  Haskell bindings to [bibutils].

  [citeproc-hs] is a library that exports functions to parse [CSL]
  styles and [MODS] collections, to process lists of citation groups and
  to format the processed output. The output is a Haskell data type that
  can be further processed for conversion to any kind of formats (at the
  present time plain ASCII and the [pandoc] native format)

  Download
  --------

  [citeproc-hs] can be downloaded from [Hackage]:

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/citeproc-hs>

  To get the darcs source run:

          darcs get http://gorgias.mine.nu/repos/citeproc-hs/

  Installation
  ------------

  [citeproc-hs] depends on a few Haskell packages. Most of them come
  with the [Haskell Platform] and are usually included in every Haskell
  tool-chain.

  In order to install [citeproc-hs] you need to install its
  dependencies. You can choose to manually download and install
  everything from [Hackage]:

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/hxt>

  Every package downloaded form [Hackage] can be installed with these
  simple commands:

          runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
          runhaskell Setup.lhs build
          runhaskell Setup.lhs install

  This last step requires `root` privileges.

  If you don't have `root` privileges you can install citeproc-hs and
  *all* its dependencies locally with these commands:

          runhaskell Setup.lhs configure --user --prefix=$HOME
          runhaskell Setup.lhs build
          runhaskell Setup.lhs install --user

  Alternatively you can use [cabal-install] to install [citeproc-hs] and
  all the needed dependencies:

          cabal update
          cabal install citeproc-hs


  ### Installing without bibutils or network support

  [bibutils] and network support may be suppressed with cabal flags:


          runhaskell Setup.lhs configure -f'-bibutils'

  or

          runhaskell Setup.lhs configure -f'-bibutils -network'

  and then build and install with:

          runhaskell Setup.lhs build
          runhaskell Setup.lhs install

  It is possible to pass the flags also too [cabal-install].

  ### Installing with ICU support

  Sorting Unicode strings containing non ASCII characters is not
  supported by the standard Haskell libraries and requires the
  installation of the ICU libraries, available here:


          http://site.icu-project.org/


  It is then necessary to install the Haskell bindings to these
  libraries. These bindings are available here:


          http://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-icu


  You then need to configure the citeproc-hs package with the
  appropriate cabal flag:


          runhaskell Setup.lhs configure -funicode_collation


  and then build as usual.

  It is possible to pass the flags also too [cabal-install]. In this
  case the installation of the ICU libraries is the only prerequisite.


  Using citeproc-hs with Pandoc
  -----------------------------

  Future releases of [pandoc] will depend on [citeproc-hs] and no
  specific step will be required to activate citeproc support.

  Please refer to [pandoc]'s documentation for more information on
  inserting citations in [pandoc]'s documents.


  Documentation
  -------------

  [Haddock] documentation for the exported API is available on
  [Hackage]:

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/citeproc-hs>

  ### Name parsing

  The [MODS] parser has been optimized for bibtex input, especially for
  parsing names with affixes , dropping and non-dropping particles.

  Suffixes should come after the family name:

          Brown, Jr., John W.

  If a comma is needed before the suffix, an exclamation mark may be
  used:

          Brown,! Jr., John W.

  Non-dropping particles are placed before the family name:

          von Hicks,! Jr., Michael

  Dropping particles are placed after the given name:

          la Martine,! III, Martin B. de

  See also the [CSL] specification:

  <http://citationstyles.org/downloads/specification.html#name-particles>

  ### Date parsing

  The [MODS] parser, which is used to read all bibliograhic databases
  supported by [bibutils], tries to parse dates, including seasons
  (expressed in English). An example of supported formats:

      2010-01-31   (January 31, 2010)

      2004-05      (May, 2004)

      2001         (the year only)

      Summer, 2001 (the season)

  ### The DOI variable

  If the DOI variable is prefixed by a `doi:` like:

          doi = {doi:10.1038/171737a0}

  the processor will generate a link and produce this pandoc native
  representation:

         Link [Str "10.1038/171737a0"] ("http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/171737a0", "10.1038/171737a0")

  that produces a link like:

         <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/171737a0">10.1038/171737a0</a>

  ### Running the test-suite

  To run the test suite, you first need to grab it with [mercurial] by
  running, from the root directory of the [citeproc-hs] source tree:

          hg clone https://bitbucket.org/bdarcus/citeproc-test

  You then need to grind human-readable test code into machine-readable
  form by running, in the citeproc-test directory, the following
  commands:

          cd citeproc-test
          ./processor.py -g
          cd ..

  Then, from the root directory of citeproc-hs source tree, run:

          runhaskell test/test.hs

  You may also specify a test group:

          runhaskell test/test.hs date

  or a single test in a group:

          runhaskell test/test.hs date IgnoreNonexistentSort


  To increase the debug messages edit *test/test.hs* and increase the
  *Int* parameter of *runTS*:

          runTS args 1 testDir

  Known Issues
  ------------

  The [CSL] implementation is mostly but not entirely complete. Some of
  the missing features are meaningless in [pandoc], the main target of
  [citeproc-hs] at the present time. Specifically the [display]
  attribute has not been implemented yet.

  The [citeproc-hs]-0.3.9 release passes 586 out of 757 tests of the
  [citeproc-test] suite. The test-suite has been developed along with
  [citeproc-js], and the failure of some of those tests is not
  meaningful for [citeproc-hs].

  The [MODS] parser may need some refinement.

  Bug Reports
  -----------

  To submit bug reports you can use the Google code bug tracking system
  available at the following address:

  Credits
  -------

  [Bruce D'Arcus], the man behind [CSL], Rintze Zelle, one of the main
  [CSL] developer, and [Frank Bennett], the [citeproc-js] author, have
  been very kind and provided ideas, comments and suggestions that made
  it easier coding citeproc-hs.

  [John MacFarlane], the author of [pandoc], has been very supportive of
  the project and provided a lot of useful feed back, comments and
  suggestions.
