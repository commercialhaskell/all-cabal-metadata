  # citeproc changelog

  ## 0.5

    * Add `linkBibliography` field to `CiteprocOptions` [API change].
      When this is set to True, we hyperlink bibliography entries according
      to the draft of the CSL v1.02 spec (Appendix VI).  When an entry has
      a DOI, PMCID, PMID, or URL available but none of these are rendered
      by the style, add a link to the title (or, if no title is present,
      the whole entry), using the URL for the DOI, PMCID, PMID, or URL
      (in that order of priority).  (Benjamin Bray, #88.)

    * In generating citation labels, only use `issued` date.
      Not, for example, `accessed` (#80).

    * Citeproc.Locale: export `lookupQuotes`.  [API change]

    * Citeproc.Types: Add `localizeQuotes` method to CiteprocOutput class
      [API change].

    * Citeproc.CslJson, Citeproc.Pandoc: Implement `localizeQuotes`.

    * Citeproc: apply `localizeQuotes` after rendering.  This ensures
      that quotes are properly localized and flipflopped.  Previously this
      was done in `renderCslJson` (for CSL JSON) and in pandoc
      (for Pandoc Inlines).  It is more consistent to do this as part
      of the rendering pipeline, in citeproc itself.

    * Citeproc.CslJson: Drop the Locale parameter from the signature of
      `renderCslJson` [breaking API change].  It was only needed for quote
      localization, which now occurs outside of this function.

    * Citeproc.Pandoc: use a Span with class csl-quoted for quotes,
      rather than a Quoted inline.  This way we can leave Quoted elements
      passed in by pandoc alone, and we won't get strange effects like the
      one described in #87 (where `"` behaves differently when in
      a citation suffix).

    * Default to Shifted with `icu` flag (#83).  This makes the library
      behave similarly whether compiled with `icu` or with the default
      `unicode-collation` and prevents test failures with `icu`.

    * Require recent text-icu with icu flag.
      Older versions don't build with newer versions of icu4c.

    * Support links in CslJson (Benjamin Bray). Currently they are
      only supported in rendering, not parsing (in support of #88).

    * Allow test cases to specify CiteprocOptions (Benjamin Bray).

    * Update locales from upstream.

    * Add new CSL tests to repository.


  ## 0.4.1

    * Change Pandoc `inNote` so it creates a `Span` with class `csl-note`
      rather than a `Note`.  This should make it easier to integrate
      citations with ordinary notes in pandoc.
    * Do not hyperlink author-only citations (#77).  If we do this we get
      two consecutive hyperlinks for author-in-text forms.
    * `movePunctuationInsideQuotes`: only move `,` and `.`, not `?` and `!`,
      as per the CSL spec.

  ## 0.4.0.1

    * Fix bug introduced by the fix to #61 (#74).
      In certain circumstances, we could get doubled "et al.".
    * Depend on unicode-collation unconditionally (#71).  It is necessary
      even when text-icu is used, because of Text.Collate.Lang.
    * Rename tests in extra/ so they fall into categories.

  ## 0.4

    * We now use Lang from unicode-collation rather than defining our own.
      The type constructor has changed, as has the signature of
      parseLang.
    * Use unicode-collation by default for more accurate sorting.
      - text-icu will still be used if the icu flag is set.  This may
        give better performance, at the cost of depending on a large
        C library.
      - Change type of SortKeyValue so it doesn't embed Lang. [API change]
        Instead, we now store a language-specific collator in the Eval Context.
      - Move compSortKeyValues from Types to Eval.
    * Add curly open quote to word splitters in normalizeSortKey.
    * Improve date sorting: use the format YYYY0000 if no month, day,
      and YYYYMM00 if no day when generating sort keys.
    * Special treatment of literal "others" as last name in a list (#61).
      When we convert bibtex/biblatex bibliographies, the form "and others"
      yields a last name with nameLiteral = "others".  We detect this and
      generate a localized "and others" (et al).
    * Make abbreviations case-insensitive (#45).

  ## 0.3.0.9

   * Implement `et-al-subsequent-min` and `et-al-subsequent-use-first` (#60).

  ## 0.3.0.8

   * In parsing abbreviations JSON, ignore top-level fields
     besides "default" (#57), e.g. "info" which is used in Zotero's
     default abbreviations file.

  ## 0.3.0.7

    * Remove check for ASCII in case transform code.
      Previously we weren't doing case transform on words
      containing non-ASCII characters.

  ## 0.3.0.6

    * Fix infinite loop in `fixPunct` (#49).  In a few rare cases
      `fixPunct` would hang.

  ## 0.3.0.5

    * Add a space between "no date" term and disambiguator
      if the long form is used (#47).

  ## 0.3.0.4

    * Improve disambiguation code.  Add type signatures,
      move some functions to the top-level, and make the
      logic clearer and more efficient.
    * Re-render after each stage of ambiguity resolution
      instead of relying on analysis of names and dates.
      This is necessary especially for styles like
      chicago-note-bibliography which use titles in
      citations.  Closes #44.  No measurable
      performance impact.
    * Update test suite from upstream.
    * Update `it-IT` locale.

  ## 0.3.0.3

    * Fix author-only citations (#43).  We got bad results with some
      styles when a reference had both an author and a translator.

  ## 0.3.0.2

    * Don't use cite-group delimiter if ANY citation in group has
      locator (#38).  This seems to be citeproc.js's behavior and it gives
      better results for chicago-author-date:  we want both
      `[@foo20; @foo21, p. 3]` and `[@foo20, p. 3; @foo21]` to produce
      a semicolon separator, rather than a comma.

  ## 0.3.0.1

    * Better handle `initialize-with` that ends in a nonbreaking space.
      In this case, citeproc should not add an additional space
      or strip the nonbreaking space.  Closes #37.


  ## 0.3

    * Change `makeReferenceMap` to return a cleaned-up list of
      references as well as a reference map.  The cleanup-up list
      removes references with duplicate ids.  When there are multiple
      references with the same id, the last one is included and
      the others discarded.  [API change]

  ## 0.2.0.1

    * FromJSON for Name: make straight quotes curly.
      Otherwise nothing will do this, when we are decoding
      JSON to (Reference a), a /= CslJson Text.
    * Remove redundant pragmas and imports (Albert Krewinkel).
    * Use custom prelude with GHC 8.6.* and older (Albert
      Krewinkel).  This adds support for GHC 8.0.x.

  ## 0.2

    * Remove `AfterOtherPunctuation` constructor from
      `CaseTransformState` [API change].
      This gave bad results with things like parentheses (#27).
    * Change `SortKeyValue` to include `Maybe Lang` [API change].
      This allows us to do locale-sensitive sorting (though this
      won't matter much unless the `icu` flag is used).
    * Add `Maybe Lang` parameter on `initialize` (since
      capitalization can be locale-dependent).
    * Add cabal.project.icu for building with icu lib.
    * Add (unexported) Citeproc.Unicode compatibility module.
      This allows us to use the same functions whether or not
      the `icu` flag is used.

  ## 0.1.1.1

    * Pay attention to citationNoteNumber in computing position.
      In calculating whether an item is alone in its citation,
      we need to take into account citationNoteNumber, since
      two citations may occur in the same note and they should
      not be ranked "alone." See jgm/pandoc#6813,
      citation-style-language/documentation#121

  ## 0.1.1

    * Ensure that uncited references are sorted last
      when it comes to assigning citation numbers (#22).
    * Remove "capitalize initial term" feature.  This is required by
      the test suite but not the spec.  It makes more sense for us to do
      this capitalization in the calling program, e.g. pandoc.  For some
      citations in note styles may already be in notes and thus not
      trigger separate footnotes.  If initial terms had been capitalized,
      we'd need to uncapitalize, and that is hard to do reliably.
    * Treat empty `FancyVal` as an empty value.
    * Derive Functor, Traversable, Foldable for Result [API change].

  ## 0.1.0.3

    * Better handling of author-only/suppress-author.
      Previously all results of "names" elements were treated
      as authors.  But only the first should be (generally this
      is the author, but it could be the editor of an edited
      volume with no author).  See jgm/pandoc#6765.

  ## 0.1.0.2

    * Don't enclose contents of e:choose in a Formatted element (#19).
      The e:choose element is "transparent" and the delimiter
      controlling its formatting should be inserted between
      the items it returns.

  ## 0.1.0.1

    * Fix sorting when no `<sorting>` element given. The spec says:
      "In the absence of cs:sort, cites and bibliographic entries appear in
      the order in which they are cited." This affects IEEE in particular.  See
      jgm/pandoc#6741.

    * Improve `sameNames` and citation grouping.  Preivously if a citation
      item had a prefix, it would not be grouped with following citations.
      See jgm/pandoc#6722 for discussion.

    * Remove unneeded `hasNoSuffix` check in `sameNames`.

    * Remove unneeded import

    * `citeproc` executable: strip BOM before parsing style (#18).

  ## 0.1

    * Initial release.

description: "# citeproc\n\n[![BSD2 license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSD2-blue.svg)](LICENSE)\n[![CI\ntests](https://github.com/jgm/citeproc/workflows/CI%20tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jgm/citeproc/actions)\n[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/citeproc.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/citeproc)\n\nThis
  library generates citations and bibliography formatted\naccording to a [CSL] style.
  \ Currently version 1.0.2 of the CSL\nspec is targeted.\n\nThis library is a successor
  to pandoc-citeproc, which was a fork\nof Andrea Rossato's citeproc-hs.  I always
  found it difficult to\nfix bugs in pandoc-citeproc and decided that implementing\nciteproc
  from scratch would give me a better basis for\nunderstanding.  This library has
  a number of other advantages\nover pandoc-citeproc:\n\n- it is much faster (as a
  rough benchmark, running the CSL\n  test suite takes less than 4 seconds with this
  library,\n  compared to 12 seconds with pandoc-citeproc)\n\n- it interprets CSL
  more faithfully, passing more of the CSL\n  tests\n\n- it has fewer dependencies
  (in particular, it does not depend\n  on pandoc)\n\n- it is more flexible, not being
  tied to pandoc's types.\n\nUnlike pandoc-citeproc, this library does not provide
  an\nexecutable.  It will be used in pandoc itself to provide\nintegrated citation
  support and bibliography format conversion\n(so the pandoc-citeproc filter will
  no longer be necessary).\n\n[CSL]: https://docs.citationstyles.org/en/stable/specification.html\n\n##
  How to use it\n\nThe main point of entry is the function `citeproc` from the\nmodule
  `Citeproc`.  This takes as arguments:\n\n- a `CiteprocOptions` structure, which
  includes the following options:\n\n  * `linkCitations` controls whether citations
  are hyperlinked \n     to the bibliography.\n\n  * `linkBibliography` automatically
  linkifies any identifiers (DOI, \n     PMCID, PMID, or URL) appearing in a bibliography
  entry.  When an\n     entry has a DOI, PMCID, PMID, or URL available but none of
  these\n     are rendered by the style, add a link to the title (or, if no title\n
  \    is present, the whole entry), using the URL for the DOI, PMCID, \n     PMID,
  or URL (in that order of priority).  See\n     [Appendix VI](https://github.com/citation-style-language/documentation/blob/master/specification.rst#appendix-vi-links)\n
  \    of the CSL v1.0.2 spec.\n\n\n- a `Style`, which you will want to produce by
  parsing a CSL\n  style file using `parseStyle` from `Citeproc.Style`.\n\n- Optionally
  a `Lang`, which allows you to override a default locale,\n\n- a list of `Reference`s,
  which you can produce from a CSL JSON\n  bibliography using aeson's `decode`,\n\n-
  a list of `Citation`s (each of which may have multiple\n  `CitationItems`).\n\nIt
  yields a `Result`, which includes a list of formatted\ncitations and a formatted
  bibliography, as well any warnings\nproduced in evaluating the style.\n\nThe types
  are parameterized on a `CiteprocOutput` instance `a`,\nwhich represents formatted
  content in your bibliographic\nfields (e.g. the title).  If you want a classic CSL
  processor,\nyou can use `CslJson Text`.  But you can also use another type,\nsuch
  as a pandoc `Inlines`.  All you need to do is define\nan instance of `CiteprocOutput`
  for your type.\n\nThe signature of `parseStyle` may not be self-evident:\nthe first
  argument is a function that takes a URL and\nretrieves the text from that URL.  This
  is used to fetch\nthe \"indendent parent\" of a dependent style.  You can supply\nwhatever
  function you like: it can search your local file\nsystem or fetch the content via
  HTTP.  If you're not using\ndependent styles, you can get by with `\\_ -> return
  mempty`.\n\n## The citeproc executable\n\nIf the package is compiled with the `executable`
  flag, an\nexecutable `citeproc` will be built.  `citeproc` reads\na JSON-encoded
  `Inputs` object from `stdin` (or from\na file if a filename is provided) and writes\na
  JSON-encoded `Result` object to `stdout`.  This executable\ncan be used to add citation
  processing to non-Haskell projects.\n\n`citeproc --help` will summarize usage information.
  \ See\nthe [man page](man/citeproc.1.md) for more information.\n\n## Known bugs
  and limitations\n\nAlthough this library is much more accurate in implementing the\nCSL
  spec than pandoc-citeproc was, it still fails some of the\ntests from the CSL test
  suite (67/862).  However, most of the\nfailures are on minor corner cases, and in
  many cases the\nexpected behavior goes beyond what is required by the CSL spec.\n(For
  example, we intentionally refrain from capitalizing\nterms in initial position in
  note styles. It makes more sense\nfor the calling program, e.g. pandoc, to do the
  capitalization\nwhen it puts the citations in notes, since some citations\nin note
  styles may already be in notes and in this case\ntheir rendering may not require
  capitalization. It is easy\nto capitalize reliably, hard to uncapitalize reliably.)\n\n"
