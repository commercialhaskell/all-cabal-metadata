  # citeproc changelog

  ## 0.1

  * Initial release.

  ## 0.1.0.1

    * Fix sorting when no `<sorting>` element given. The spec says:
      "In the absence of cs:sort, cites and bibliographic entries appear in
      the order in which they are cited." This affects IEEE in particular.  See
      jgm/pandoc#6741.

    * Improve `sameNames` and citation grouping.  Preivously if a citation
      item had a prefix, it would not be grouped with following citations.
      See jgm/pandoc#6722 for discussion.

    * Remove unneeded `hasNoSuffix` check in `sameNames`.

    * Remove unneeded import

    * `citeproc` executable: strip BOM before parsing style (#18).

  # citeproc

  [![BSD2 license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSD2-blue.svg)](LICENSE)
  [![CI
  tests](https://github.com/jgm/citeproc/workflows/CI%20tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jgm/citeproc/actions)
  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/citeproc.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/citeproc)

  This library generates citations and bibliography formatted
  according to a [CSL] style.  Currently version 1.0.2 of the CSL
  spec is targeted.

  This library is a successor to pandoc-citeproc, which was a fork
  of Andrea Rossato's citeproc-hs.  I always found it difficult to
  fix bugs in pandoc-citeproc and decided that implementing
  citeproc from scratch would give me a better basis for
  understanding.  This library has a number of other advantages
  over pandoc-citeproc:

  - it is much faster (as a rough benchmark, running the CSL
    test suite takes less than 4 seconds with this library,
    compared to 12 seconds with pandoc-citeproc)

  - it interprets CSL more faithfully, passing more of the CSL
    tests

  - it has fewer dependencies (in particular, it does not depend
    on pandoc)

  - it is more flexible, not being tied to pandoc's types.

  Unlike pandoc-citeproc, this library does not provide an
  executable.  It will be used in pandoc itself to provide
  integrated citation support and bibliography format conversion
  (so the pandoc-citeproc filter will no longer be necessary).

  [CSL]: https://docs.citationstyles.org/en/stable/specification.html

  ## How to use it

  The main point of entry is the function `citeproc` from the
  module `Citeproc`.  This takes as arguments:

  - a `CiteprocOptions` structure (which currently just allows you
    to set whether citations are hyperlinked to the bibliography)

  - a `Style`, which you will want to produce by parsing a CSL
    style file using `parseStyle` from `Citeproc.Style`.

  - Optionally a `Lang`, which allows you to override a default locale,

  - a list of `Reference`s, which you can produce from a CSL JSON
    bibliography using aeson's `decode`,

  - a list of `Citation`s (each of which may have multiple
    `CitationItems`).

  It yields a `Result`, which includes a list of formatted
  citations and a formatted bibliography, as well any warnings
  produced in evaluating the style.

  The types are parameterized on a `CiteprocOutput` instance `a`,
  which represents formatted content in your bibliographic
  fields (e.g. the title).  If you want a classic CSL processor,
  you can use `CslJson Text`.  But you can also use another type,
  such as a pandoc `Inlines`.  All you need to do is define
  an instance of `CiteprocOutput` for your type.

  The signature of `parseStyle` may not be self-evident:
  the first argument is a function that takes a URL and
  retrieves the text from that URL.  This is used to fetch
  the "indendent parent" of a dependent style.  You can supply
  whatever function you like: it can search your local file
  system or fetch the content via HTTP.  If you're not using
  dependent styles, you can get by with `\_ -> return mempty`.

  ## The citeproc executable

  If the package is compiled with the `executable` flag, an
  executable `citeproc` will be built.  `citeproc` reads
  a JSON-encoded `Inputs` object from `stdin` (or from
  a file if a filename is provided) and writes
  a JSON-encoded `Result` object to `stdout`.  This executable
  can be used to add citation processing to non-Haskell projects.

  `citeproc --help` will summarize usage information.  See
  the [man page](man/citeproc.1.md) for more information.

  ## Known bugs and limitations

  Although this library is much more accurate in implementing the
  CSL spec than pandoc-citeproc was, it still fails some of the
  tests from the CSL test suite (58/845).  However, most of the
  failures are on minor corner cases, and in many cases the
  expected behavior goes beyond what is required by the CSL spec.
