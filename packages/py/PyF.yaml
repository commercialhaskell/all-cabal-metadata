  # Revision history for PyF

  ## 0.7.3.0 -- 2019-02-28

  - Tests: fix non reproducible tests

  ## 0.7.2.0 -- 2019-02-27

  - Fixed: PyF now uses the same haskell extensions as the one used by the current haskell file to parse sub expressions.

  ## 0.7.1.0 -- 2019-02-11

  - Fixed: PyF was wrongly ignoring everything located after a non-doubled closing delimiter.
  - New Feature: line break can be escaped with \, thus allowing string to start on a new line ignoring the initial backspace

  ## 0.7.0.0 -- 2019-02-04

  - Bump dependencies to megaparsec 7
  - Error message are now tested
  - Name in template haskell splices are stable. This increases readability of error messages
  - Better error message for badly formated expression

  ### Formatting removal

  - All monomorphic quasiquoters (`f`, `fString`, `fText`, `fIO`, `fLazyText`) are removed
  - Polymophic quasiquoter `f'` is renamed `f` and is the only entry point. Monomorphic users are encouraged to use the polymorphic quasiquoter with type annotation.
  - `Formatting` dependency is removed.
  - Previously named `f` quasiquoters which was exporting to `Formatting.Format` is removed. User of this behavior should use `Formatting.now` instead.

  ## 0.6.1.0 -- 2018-08-03

  - Custom delimiters, you can use whatever delimiters you want in place of `{` and `}`.

  ## 0.6.0.0 -- 2018-08-02

  - Fix the espace parsing of `{{` and `}}` as `{` and `}`

  ## 0.5.0.0 -- 2018-04-16

  - Support for negative zero
  - Support for 0 modifier
  - Exponential formatter now behaves as python
  - Support for alternate floatting point represenation
  - Lot of documentation
  - Test are auto verified with the python reference implementation

  ## 0.4.0.0 -- 2018-04-13

  - Support for grouping option
  - Support for inner allignment
  - Correct display of NaN and Infinity
  - Fix a few cosmetic with python implementation
  - Introduce `PyF.Formatters`, type safe generic number formatter solution
  - Remove dependency to `scientific`


  ## 0.3.0.0 -- 2018-04-01

  * Support for haskell subexpression

  ## 0.1.1.0  -- 2018-01-07

  * Add support for the `sign` field.

  ## 0.1.0.0  -- 2018-01-03

  # PyF

  [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/guibou/PyF.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/guibou/PyF)

  *PyF* is a Haskell library for string interpolation and formatting.

  *PyF* exposes a quasiquoter `f` which introduces string interpolation and formatting with a mini language inspired from printf and Python.

  # Quick Start

  ```haskell
  >>> import PyF

  >>> name = "Dave"
  >>> age = 54

  >>> [f|Person's name is {name}, age is {age:x}|]
  "Person's name is Dave, age is 36"
  ```

  The formatting mini language can represent:

  - Numbers with different representations (fixed point, general representation, binary, hexadecimal, octal)
  - Padding, with the choice of padding char, alignment (left, right, around, between sign and number)
  - Sign handling, to display or not the `+` for positive number
  - Number grouping
  - Floating point representation
  - The interpolated value can be any Haskell expression

  You will need the extension `QuasiQuotes`, enable it with `{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes #-}` in top of your source file or with `:set -XQuasiQuotes` in your `ghci` session. `ExtendedDefaultRules` and `OverloadedStrings` may be more convenient.

  Expression to be formatted are referenced by `{expression:formatingOptions}` where `formatingOptions` follows the [Python format mini-language](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec). It is recommended to read the python documentation, but the [Test file](https://github.com/guibou/PyF/blob/master/test/Spec.hs) as well as this readme contain many examples.

  # More Examples

  ## Padding

  Left `<` / Right `>` / Around `^` padding:

  ```haskell
  >>> name = "Guillaume"
  >>> [f|{name:<11}|]
  "Guillaume  "
  >>> [f|{name:>11}|]
  "  Guillaume"
  >>> [f|{name:|^13}|]
  "||Guillaume||"
  ```

  Padding inside `=` the sign:

  ```haskell
  >>> [f|{-pi:=10.3}|]
  "-    3.142"
  ```

  ## Float rounding

  ```haskell
  >>> [f|{pi:.2}|]
  "3.14"
  ```

  ## Binary / Octal / Hex representation (with or without prefix)

  ```haskell
  >>> v = 31
  >>> [f|Binary: {v:#b}|]
  "Binary: 0b11111"
  >>> [f|Octal (no prefix): {age:o}|]
  "Octal (no prefix): 37"
  >>> [f|Hexa (caps and prefix): {age:#X}|]
  "Hexa (caps and prefix): 0x1F"
  ```

  ## Grouping

  Using `,` or `_`.

  ```haskell
  >>> [f|{10 ^ 9 - 1:,}|]
  "999,999,999"
  >>> [f|{2 ^ 32  -1:_b}|]
  "1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1111"
  ```

  ## Sign handling

  Using `+` to display the positive sign (if any) or ` ` to display a space instead:

  ```haskell
  >>> [f|{pi:+.3}|]
  "+3.142"
  >>> [f|{pi: .3}|]
  " 3.142"
  ```

  ## 0

  Preceding the width with a `0` enables sign-aware zero-padding, this is equivalent to inside `=` padding with a fill char of `0`.

  ```haskell
  >>> [f{-10:010}|]
  -000000010
  ```

  ## Sub-expressions

  First argument inside the curly braces can be a valid Haskell expression, for example:

  ```haskell
  >>> [f|2pi = {2* pi:.2}|]
  6.28
  >>> [f|tail "hello" = {tail "hello":->6}|]
  "tail \"hello\" = --ello"
  ```

  However the expression must not contain `}` or `:` characters.

  ## Combined

  Most options can be combined. This generally leads to totally unreadable format string ;)

  ```haskell
  >>> [f|{pi:~>5.2}|]
  "~~3.14"
  ```

  ## Multi-line strings

  You can ignore a line break with `\` if needed. For example:

  ```haskell
  [f|\
  - a
  - b\
  |]
  ```

  Will returns `-a\n-b`. Note how the first and last line breaks are ignored.

  # Output type

  *PyF* main entry point `f` is polymorphic and can represents `Text`, lazy `Text`, `String`, lazy text `Builder` or `IO` operations. Most of the time, type inference will do the right thing for you, but you may need to add type annotations.

  For example:

  ```haskell
  >>> [f|hello {pi.2}|] :: String
  "hello 3.14"
  ```

  Note: it works in ghci without any type annotation if the extensions
  `OverloadedStrings` and `ExtendedDefaultRules` are enabled.

  # Caveats

  ## Type inference

  Type inference with numeric literals can be unreliable if your variables are too polymorphic. A type annotation or the extension `ExtendedDefaultRules` will help.

  ```haskell
  >>> v = 10 :: Double
  >>> [f|A float: {v}|]
  A float: 10
  ```

  ## Error reporting

  Template haskell is generally known to give developers a lot of
  frustration when it comes to error message, dumping an unreadable
  piece of generated code.

  However, in PyF, we took great care to provide clear error reporting, this means that:

  - Any parsing error on the mini language results in a clear indication of the error, for example:

  ```haskell
  >>> [f|{age:.3d}|]

  <interactive>:77:4: error:
      • <interactive>:1:8:
    |
  1 | {age:.3d}
    |        ^
  Type incompatible with precision (.3), use any of {'e', 'E', 'f', 'F', 'g', 'G', 'n', 's', '%'} or remove the precision field.
  ```

  - Error in variable name are also readable:

  ```haskell
  >>> [f|{toto}|]
  <interactive>:78:4: error: Variable not in scope: toto
  ```

  - However, if the interpolated name is not of a compatible type (or
    too polymorphic), you will get an awful error:

  ```haskell
  >>*> [f|{True:d}|]

  <interactive>:80:10: error:
      • No instance for (Integral Bool)
          arising from a use of ‘PyF.Internal.QQ.formatAnyIntegral’
  ...
  ```

  - There is also one class of error related to alignement which can be triggered, when using alignement inside sign (i.e. `=`) with string. This can fail in two flavors:

  ```haskell
  >>> [f|{"hello":=10s}|]

  <interactive>:88:1: error:
      • Exception when trying to run compile-time code:
          String Cannot be aligned with the inside `=` mode
  CallStack (from HasCallStack):
    error, called at src/PyF/Internal/QQ.hs:143:18 in PyF-0.4.0.0-inplace:PyF.Internal.QQ
        Code: quoteExp f "{\"hello\":=10s}"
      • In the quasi-quotation: [f|{"hello":=10s}|]
  ```

  And

  ```haskell
  *PyF PyF.Internal.QQ> [f|{"hello":=10}|]

  <interactive>:89:10: error:
      • String Cannot be aligned with the inside `=` mode
  ...
  ```

  - Finally, if you make any type error inside the expression field, you are on your own:

  ```haskell
  >>> [f|{3 + pi + "hello":10}|]

  <interactive>:99:10: error:
      • No instance for (Floating [Char]) arising from a use of ‘pi’
      ...
  ```

  ## Custom Delimiters

  If `{` and `}` does not fit your needs, for example if you are formatting a lot of json, you can use custom delimiters. All quasi quoters have a parametric form which accepts custom delimiters. Due to template haskell stage restriction, you must define your custom quasi quoter in an other module.

  For example, in `MyCustomDelimiter.hs`:

  ```haskell
  module MyCustomQQ where

  import Language.Haskell.TH.Quote

  import PyF

  myCustomFormatter :: QuasiQuoter
  myCustomFormatter = fWithDelimiters ('@','!')
  ```

  Later, in another module:

  ```haskell
  import MyCustomQQ

  -- ...

  [myCustomFormatter|pi = @pi:2.f!|]
  ```

  Escaping still works by doubling the delimiters, `@@!!@@!!` will be formatted as `@!@!`.

  ## Difference with the Python Syntax

  The implementation is unit-tested against the reference python implementation (python 3.6.4) and should match its result. However some formatters are not supported or some (minor) differences can be observed.

  ### Not supported

  - Number `n` formatter is not supported. In python this formatter can format a number and use current locale information for decimal part and thousand separator. There is no plan to support that because of the impure interface needed to read the locale.
  - Python support sub variables in the formatting options, such as `{varname:.{precision}}`, we should too. However should we accept `String` parameter (such as `<`), with a possible runtime error, or should we use the `ADT` such as `AlignRight`?
  - Python literal integers accepts binary/octal/hexa/decimal literals, PyF only accept decimal ones, hdece in to plan to support that, if you really need to format a float with a number of digit provided as a binary constant, open an issue.
  - Python support adding custom formatters for new types, such as date. This may be really cool, for example `[f|{today:%Y-%M-%D}`. I don't know how to support that now.

  ### Difference

  - General formatters *g* and *G* behaves a bit differently. Precision influence the number of significant digits instead of the number of the magnitude at which the representation changes between fixed and exponential.
  - Grouping options allows grouping with an `_` for floating point, python only allows `,`.
  - Custom delimiters

  # Build / test

  Should work with `stack build; stack test`, and with `cabal` and (optionally) `nix`:

  ```shell
  nix-shell # Optional, if you use nix
  cabal new-build
  cabal new-test
  ```

  # TODO

  - Improve the error reporting with more Parsec annotation
  - Improve the parser for sub-expression (handle the `:` and `}` cases if possible).
  - Allow extension to others type / custom formatters (for date for example)
  - Improve code quality. This code is really ugly, but there is a really strong test suite so, well.
  - Work on performance, do we really care? For now, everything is internally done with `String`.
  - Directly expose the formatter to be used as a template haskell splice

  # Library note

  `PyF.Formatters` exposes two functions to format numbers. They are type-safe (as much as possible) and comes with a combination of formatting options not seen in other formatting libraries:

  ```haskell
  >>> formatIntegral Binary Plus (Just (20, AlignInside, '~')) (Just (4, ',')) 255
  "+~~~~~~~~~~1111,1111"
  ```

  # Conclusion

  Don't hesitate to make any suggestion, I'll be more than happy to work on it.
