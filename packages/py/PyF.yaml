synopsis: Quasiquotations for a python like interpolated string formatter
changelog: "# Revision history for PyF\n\n- Due to the dependencies refactor, `PyF`
  no have no dependencies other than the one packaged with GHC. The direct result
  is that `PyF` build time is reduced to 6s versus 4 minutes and 20s before.\n- Remove
  the dependency to `megaparsec` and replaces it by `parsec`. This should have minor
  impact on the error messages.\n- *Huge Change*. The parsing of embeded expression
  does not depend anymore on `haskell-src-ext` and `haskell-src-meta` and instead
  depends on the built-in `ghc` lib.\n- Added instances for `(Lazy)ByteString` to
  `PyFClassify` and `PyFToString`. `ByteString` can now be integrated into format
  string, and will be decoded as ascii.\n- Relax the constraint for floating point
  formatting from `RealFrac` to `Real`. As a result, a few new type can be formatted
  as floating point number. One drawback is that some `Integral` are `Real` too and
  hence it is not an error anymore to format an integral as floating point, but you
  still need to explicitly select a floating point formatter.\n- Added instance for
  `(Nominal)DiffTime` to `PyFClassify`, so you can now format them without conversion.\n-
  Introducing of the new typeclass `PyfFormatIntegral` and `PyfFormatFractional` in
  order to customize the formatting for numbers. An instance is derived for respectively
  any `Integral` and `Real` types.\n- Support for `Char` formatting, as string (showing
  the `Char` value) or as integral, showing the `ord`.\n- `Data.Ratio`.\n\n- Introducing
  `fmtTrim` module. It offers the same behavior as `fmt`, but trims common indentation.
  Se `PyF.trimIndent` for documentation.\n- Introducing `raw` for convenience. It
  is a multiline string without any escaping, formatting neither leading whitespace
  handling.\n- Introducing `str` and `strTrim`. They are similar to `fmt` and `fmtTrim`
  but without formatting. You can see them as multiline haskell string, with special
  character escaping, but without formatting. For convenience, the `strTrim` version
  also removes indentation.\n\n\n- `fmtWithDelimiters` is gone and replaced by `mkFormatter`
  in `PyF` which is \"more\" generic. \n\n## 0.9.0.3 -- 2021-02-06\n\n- Test phase
  do not depend anymore on python (unless cabal flag `python_test` is\n  set). This
  ease the deployment / packaging process.\n\n## 0.9.0.2 -- 2020-09-11\n\n- Version
  bump for megaparsec 9.0\n\n## 0.9.0.1 -- 2020-03-25\n\n- Fixs for GHC 8.10\n\n##
  0.9.0.0 -- 2019-12-29\n\n- Any type with `Show` instance can be formatted using
  `:s` formatter. For example, `[fmt|hello {(True, 10):s}|]`. This breaks compatibility
  because previous version of PyF was generating an error when try to format to string
  anything which was not a string, now it accepts roughly anything (with a `Show`
  instance).\n\n## 0.8.1.2 -- 2019-11-08\n\n- Bump megaparsec bounds\n\n## 0.8.1.1
  -- 2019-10-13\n\n- Compatibility with GHC 8.8\n\n## 0.8.1.0 -- 2019-09-03\n\n- Precision
  can now be any arbitrary haskell expression, such as `[fmt|hello pi = {pi:.{1 +
  3}}|]`.\n\n## 0.8.0.2 -- 2019-08-27\n\n- (minor bugfix in tests): Use python3 instead
  of \"python\" to help build on environment with both python2 and python3\n\n## 0.8.0.1
  -- 2019-08-27\n\n- Stack support\n\n## 0.8.0.0 -- 2019-08-06\n\n- `f` (and `fWithDelimiters`)
  were renamed `fmt` (`fmtWithDelimiters`). `f` was causing too much shadowing in
  any codebase.\n- PyF now exposes the typeclass `PyFToString` and `PyFClassify` which
  can be extended to support any type as input for the formatters.\n- PyF now uses
  `Data.String.IsString t` as its output type if `OverloadedString` is enabled. It
  means that it behaves as a real haskell string literal.\n- A caveat of the previous
  change is that PyF does not have instances for `IO` anymore.\n\n### bugfixes and
  general improvements\n\n- An important amount of bugfixs\n- Error reporting for
  generic formatting (i.e. formatting without a specified type) is now more robust\n-
  Template haskell splices are simpler. This leads to more efficient / small generated
  code and in the event of this code appears in a GHC error message, it is more readable.\n-
  PyF now longer emit unnecessary default typing.\n\n\n## 0.7.3.0 -- 2019-02-28\n\n-
  Tests: fix non reproducible tests\n\n## 0.7.2.0 -- 2019-02-27\n\n- Fixed: PyF now
  uses the same haskell extensions as the one used by the current haskell file to
  parse sub expressions.\n\n## 0.7.1.0 -- 2019-02-11\n\n- Fixed: PyF was wrongly ignoring
  everything located after a non-doubled closing delimiter.\n- New Feature: line break
  can be escaped with \\, thus allowing string to start on a new line ignoring the
  initial backspace\n\n## 0.7.0.0 -- 2019-02-04\n\n- Bump dependencies to megaparsec
  7\n- Error message are now tested\n- Name in template haskell splices are stable.
  This increases readability of error messages\n- Better error message for badly formated
  expression\n\n### Formatting removal\n\n- All monomorphic quasiquoters (`f`, `fString`,
  `fText`, `fIO`, `fLazyText`) are removed\n- Polymophic quasiquoter `f'` is renamed
  `f` and is the only entry point. Monomorphic users are encouraged to use the polymorphic
  quasiquoter with type annotation.\n- `Formatting` dependency is removed.\n- Previously
  named `f` quasiquoters which was exporting to `Formatting.Format` is removed. User
  of this behavior should use `Formatting.now` instead.\n\n## 0.6.1.0 -- 2018-08-03\n\n-
  Custom delimiters, you can use whatever delimiters you want in place of `{` and
  `}`.\n\n## 0.6.0.0 -- 2018-08-02\n\n- Fix the espace parsing of `{{` and `}}` as
  `{` and `}`\n\n## 0.5.0.0 -- 2018-04-16\n\n- Support for negative zero\n- Support
  for 0 modifier\n- Exponential formatter now behaves as python\n- Support for alternate
  floatting point represenation\n- Lot of documentation\n- Test are auto verified
  with the python reference implementation\n\n## 0.4.0.0 -- 2018-04-13\n\n- Support
  for grouping option\n- Support for inner allignment\n- Correct display of NaN and
  Infinity\n- Fix a few cosmetic with python implementation\n- Introduce `PyF.Formatters`,
  type safe generic number formatter solution\n- Remove dependency to `scientific`\n\n\n##
  0.3.0.0 -- 2018-04-01\n\n* Support for haskell subexpression\n\n## 0.1.1.0  -- 2018-01-07\n\n*

  # PyF

  *PyF* is a Haskell library for string interpolation and formatting.

  *PyF* exposes a quasiquoter `f` which introduces string interpolation and formatting with a mini language inspired from printf and Python.

  # Quick Start

  ```haskell
  >>> import PyF

  >>> name = "Dave"
  >>> age = 54

  >>> [fmt|Person's name is {name}, age is {age}|]
  "Person's name is Dave, age is 54"
  ```

  The formatting mini language can represent:

  - Numbers with different representations (fixed point, general representation, binary, hexadecimal, octal)
  - Padding, with the choice of padding char, alignment (left, right, around, between sign and number)
  - Sign handling, to display or not the `+` for positive number
  - Number grouping
  - Floating point representation
  - The interpolated value can be any Haskell expression.

  You will need the extension `QuasiQuotes`, enable it with `{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes #-}` in top of your source file or with `:set -XQuasiQuotes` in your `ghci` session. `ExtendedDefaultRules` and `OverloadedStrings` may be more convenient.

  Expression to be formatted are referenced by `{expression:formattingOptions}` where `formattingOptions` follows the [Python format mini-language](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec). It is recommended to read the python documentation, but the [Test file](https://github.com/guibou/PyF/blob/main/test/Spec.hs) as well as this readme contain many examples.

  # More Examples

  ## Padding

  Left `<` / Right `>` / Around `^` padding:

  ```haskell
  >>> name = "Guillaume"
  >>> [fmt|{name:<11}|]
  "Guillaume  "
  >>> [fmt|{name:>11}|]
  "  Guillaume"
  >>> [fmt|{name:|^13}|]
  "||Guillaume||"
  ```

  Padding inside `=` the sign

  ```haskell
  >>> [fmt|{-3:=6}|]
  "-    3"
  ```

  ## Float rounding

  ```haskell
  >>> [fmt|{pi:.2}|]
  "3.14"
  ```

  ## Binary / Octal / Hex representation (with or without prefix using `#`)

  ```haskell
  >>> v = 31
  >>> [fmt|Binary: {v:#b}|]
  "Binary: 0b11111"
  >>> [fmt|Octal: {v:#o}|]
  "Octal: 0o37"
  >>> [fmt|Octal (no prefix): {v:o}|]
  "Octal (no prefix): 37"
  >>> [fmt|Hexa (caps and prefix): {v:#X}|]
  "Hexa (caps and prefix): 0x1F"
  ```

  ## Grouping

  Using `,` or `_`.

  ```haskell
  >>> [fmt|{10 ^ 9 - 1:,}|]
  "999,999,999"
  >>> [fmt|{2 ^ 32  -1:_b}|]
  "1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1111"
  ```

  ## Sign handling

  Using `+` to display the positive sign (if any) or ` ` to display a space instead:

  ```haskell
  >>> [fmt|{pi:+.3}|]
  "+3.142"
  >>> [fmt|{-pi:+.3} (Negative number)|]
  "-3.142 (Negative number)"
  >>> [fmt|{pi: .3}|]
  " 3.142"
  >>> [fmt|{-pi: .3} (Negative number)|]
  "-3.142 (Negative number)"
  ```

  ## 0

  Preceding the width with a `0` enables sign-aware zero-padding, this is equivalent to inside `=` padding with a fill char of `0`.

  ```haskell
  >>> [f{10:010}|]
  0000000010
  >>> [f{-10:010}|]
  -000000010
  ```

  ## Sub-expressions

  First argument inside the curly braces can be a valid Haskell expression, for example:

  ```haskell
  >>> [fmt|2pi = {2* pi:.2}|]
  2pi = 6.28
  >>> [fmt|tail "hello" = {tail "hello":->6}|]
  "tail \"hello\" = --ello"
  ```

  However the expression must not contain `}` or `:` characters.

  ## Combined

  Most options can be combined. This generally leads to totally unreadable format string ;)

  ```haskell
  >>> [fmt|{pi:~>5.2}|]
  "~~3.14"
  ```

  ## Multi-line strings

  You can ignore a line break with `\` if needed. For example:

  ```haskell
  [fmt|\
  - a
  - b\
  |]
  ```

  Will returns `-a\n-b`. Note how the first and last line breaks are ignored.

  ## Arbitrary value for precision

  The precision field can be any haskell expression instead of a fixed number:

  ```haskell
  >>> [fmt|{pi:.{1+2}}|]
  3.142
  ```

  # Output type

  *PyF* aims at extending the string literal syntax. As such, it default to `String` type. However, if the `OverloadedString` is enabled, PyF will happilly generate `IsString t => t` instead. This means that you can use PyF to generate `String`, but also `Text` and why not `ByteString`, with all the caveats known to this extension.

  ```haskell
  >>> [fmt|hello {pi.2}|] :: String
  "hello 3.14"
  ```

  # Custom types

  PyF can format three categories of input types:

  - Floating. Using the `f`, `g`, `e`, ... type specifiers. Any type instance of `RealFloat` can be formated as such.
  - Integral. Using the `d`, `b`, `x`, `o`, ... type specifiers. Any type instance of `Integral` can be formated as such.
  - String. Using the `s` type specifier. Any type instance of `PyFToString` can be formated as such.

  See `PyF.Class` if you want to create new instances for the `PyFToString` class.

  By default, if you do not provide any type specifier, PyF uses the `PyFClassify` type class to decide if your type must be formated as a Floating, Integral or String.

  # Caveats

  ## Type inference

  Type inference with numeric literals can be unreliable if your variables are too polymorphic. A type annotation or the extension `ExtendedDefaultRules` will help.

  ```haskell
  >>> v = 10 :: Double
  >>> [fmt|A float: {v}|]
  A float: 10
  ```

  ## Error reporting

  Template haskell is generally known to give developers a lot of
  frustration when it comes to error message, dumping an unreadable
  piece of generated code.

  However, in PyF, we took great care to provide clear error reporting, this means that:

  - Any parsing error on the mini language results in a clear indication of the error, for example:

  ```haskell
  >>> [fmt|{age:.3d}|]

  <interactive>:77:4: error:
      • <interactive>:1:8:
    |
  1 | {age:.3d}
    |        ^
  Type incompatible with precision (.3), use any of {'e', 'E', 'f', 'F', 'g', 'G', 'n', 's', '%'} or remove the precision field.
  ```

  - Error in variable name are also readable:

  ```haskell
  >>> [fmt|{toto}|]
  <interactive>:78:4: error: Variable not in scope: toto
  ```

  - However, if the interpolated name is not of a compatible type (or
    too polymorphic), you will get an awful error:

  ```haskell
  >>*> [fmt|{True:d}|]

  <interactive>:80:10: error:
      • No instance for (Integral Bool)
          arising from a use of ‘PyF.Internal.QQ.formatAnyIntegral’
  ...
  ```

  - There is also one class of error related to alignement which can be triggered, when using alignement inside sign (i.e. `=`) with string:

  ```haskell
  *PyF PyF.Internal.QQ> [fmt|{"hello":=10}|]

  <interactive>:89:10: error:
      • String Cannot be aligned with the inside `=` mode
  ...
  ```

  - Finally, if you make any type error inside the expression field, you are on your own:

  ```haskell
  >>> [fmt|{3 + pi + "hello":10}|]

  <interactive>:99:10: error:
      • No instance for (Floating [Char]) arising from a use of ‘pi’
      ...
  ```

  ## Custom Delimiters

  If `{` and `}` does not fit your needs, for example if you are formatting a lot of json, you can use custom delimiters. All quasi quoters have a parametric form which accepts custom delimiters. Due to template haskell stage restriction, you must define your custom quasi quoter in an other module.

  For example, in `MyCustomDelimiter.hs`:

  ```haskell
  module MyCustomQQ where

  import Language.Haskell.TH.Quote

  import PyF

  myCustomFormatter :: QuasiQuoter
  myCustomFormatter = mkFormatter "fmtWithDelimiters" (fmtConfig {
    delimiters = ('@','!')
    })
  ```

  Later, in another module:

  ```haskell
  import MyCustomQQ

  -- ...

  [myCustomFormatter|pi = @pi:2.f!|]
  ```

  Escaping still works by doubling the delimiters, `@@!!@@!!` will be formatted as `@!@!`.

  Have a look at `PyF.mkFormatter` for all the details about customization.

  ## Difference with the Python Syntax

  The implementation is unit-tested against the reference python implementation (python 3.6.4) and should match its result. However some formatters are not supported or some (minor) differences can be observed.

  ### Not supported

  - Number `n` formatter is not supported. In python this formatter can format a number and use current locale information for decimal part and thousand separator. There is no plan to support that because of the impure interface needed to read the locale.
  - Python support sub variables in the formatting options in every places, such as `{expression:.{precision}}`. We only support it for `precision`. This is more complexe to setup for others fields.
  - Python literal integers accepts binary/octal/hexa/decimal literals, PyF only accept decimal ones, I don't have a plan to support that, if you really need to format a float with a number of digit provided as a binary constant, open an issue.
  - Python support adding custom formatters for new types, such as date. This may be really cool, for example `[fmt|{today:%Y-%M-%D}`. I don't know how to support that now.

  ### Difference

  - General formatters *g* and *G* behaves a bit differently. Precision influence the number of significant digits instead of the number of the magnitude at which the representation changes between fixed and exponential.
  - Grouping options allows grouping with an `_` for floating point, python only allows `,`.
  - Custom delimiters

  # Build / test

  Should work with `stack build; stack test`, and with `cabal` and (optionally) `nix`:

  ```shell
  nix-shell # Optional, if you use nix
  cabal new-build
  cabal new-test
  ```

  There are a few available shells for you.

  - `nix-shell` is the default, current GHC version with language server available.
  - `nix-shell ./. -A pyf_xx.shell` is another GHC version (change `xx`) without language server.
  - `nix-shell ./. -A pyf_xx.shell_hls` is another GHC version (change `xx`) with language server.

  We also provide a few utility functions:

  - `nix-build ./ -A hlint` will check hlint.
  - `nix-shell ./ -A ormolu-fix` will format the codebase.

  # Library note

  `PyF.Formatters` exposes two functions to format numbers. They are type-safe (as much as possible) and comes with a combination of formatting options not seen in other formatting libraries:

  ```haskell
  >>> formatIntegral Binary Plus (Just (20, AlignInside, '~')) (Just (4, ',')) 255
  "+~~~~~~~~~~1111,1111"
  ```

  # GHC compatibility

  This library is tested in CI with ghc 8.6 to 9.2.

  # Conclusion

  Don't hesitate to make any suggestion, I'll be more than happy to work on it.

  # Hacking

  Everything works with nix. But you can also try with manual cabal / stack if you wish.

  - `nix-shell` will open a shell with everything you need to work on PyF, including haskell-language-server. It may be a bit too much, so you can instead:
  - `nix-shell ./ -A pyf_current.shell` which opens a shell without the haskell-language-server.
  - `nix-shell ./ -A pyf_current.shell_hls` which opens a shell with the haskell-language-server, same as the default.
  - `nix-shell ./ -A pyf_xx.shell[_hls]` opens a shell (with or without language server) for a difference GHC version. Uses `pyf_86`, `pyf_88`, `pyf_810`, `pyf_90` and `pyf_92`. Note that the language server may not be available for these version and it make take a bit to compile everything.

  Once in the shell, use `cabal build`, `cabal test`, `cabal repl`.

  There is a cachix available, used by CI:

  - `cachix use guibou`

  You can locally build and test everything using:

  - `nix-build -A pyf_all`.

  Don't hesitate to submit a PR not tested on all GHC versions.

  ## Formatting

  The codebase is formatted with `ormolu` and this is checked in the CI. Please run:

  - `nix-shell ./ -A ormolu-fix`
