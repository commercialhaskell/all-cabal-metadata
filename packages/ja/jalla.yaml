description: "Jalla aims at providing high level functions for linear algebra computations,\nwhich
  should be fast and easy enough to use.\nIt also contains a Haskell wrapper for cblas
  and lapacke, a C interface for LAPACK written by Intel.\nJalla is written and maintained
  by Christian Gosch (github at goschs dot de) and\nwas started as a little project
  to learn Haskell.\n\nJalla (probably) needs ghc, it has not been tested with other
  Haskell implementations.\nIt is developed with ghc > 7.0.\n\nYou need to have CBLAS
  and LAPACK installed, e.g. by installing ATLAS generated libraries\non you computer.
  \nIn Ubuntu, there are packages for CBLAS and LAPACK which you can install with
  apt-get,\nsynaptic, or any other such tool.\nLapacke must be compiled \"by hand\".\n\n0.
  Get the jalla sources; say they are located in the directory \"jalla/\"\n1. If you
  do not have LAPACKE installed, follow the instructions \n   below under \"Getting
  and building LAPACKE\".\n2. In jalla/, call \n    cabal configure\n    cabal build\n
  \   cabal haddock\n3. Look at the generated documentation, which should be quite
  informative now.\n\nPlease contact the author at github at goschs dot de if anything
  does not work!\n\n\nUsing Arch Linux\n----------------\nOn a current Arch Linux,
  you just need to install\nthe lapack package, and you should be good to go.\nLAPACKE
  is included in that package.\n\n\nGetting and building LAPACKE\n----------------------------\nLAPACKE
  is part of LAPACK since version 3.4.\nIf you have that version, use that. Otherwise:\n\nThe
  following steps of getting and building \nLAPACKE can be done with the script get_lapacke.sh.\nYou
  must have *wget* and *scons* installed on your \nsystem.\nFrom jalla's top level
  directory, call\n  ./get_lapacke.sh\nThis should download lapacke and build it with
  our\nSConstruct file, in the sub-directory ./lapacke.\nYou can source the file set_env.bash
  if you are using Bash,\nin order to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH\nvariables.\n\nNote
  that you might as well get the newest sources of LAPACK from netlib,\nand copy the
  lapacke subdirectory from there over to the jalla directory.\nBoth ways worked for
  me.\n\nIf you want to get and build manually:\n1. Get Lapacke at <http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapacke.tgz>\n
  \  or at <http://www.netlib.org/lapack/#_standard_c_language_apis_for_lapack>\n2.
  Unpack lapacke into \"./lapacke\" in the top jalla directory.\n3. (Follow lapacke's
  instructions to build)\n   /OR/ use the shiny new SCons file provided to build lapacke\n
  \  for use with jalla, which can be found in the lapacke/ sub-directory\n   in the
  jalla source code.\n\n   Note that now, you can also let the Setup.hs script do
  the work right before configuring:\n    runhaskell Setup.hs configure --user --flags=\"build_lapacke\"\n
  \  should build lapacke right before configuring jalla.   \n\n   If you don't use
  the provided SCons file, \n   note that Jalla expects the LAPACKE_... naming scheme,
  i.e. LAPACKE in upper case,\n   the rest in lower case. That scheme is called LAPACK_NAME_PATTERN_MC
  in the LAPACKE make.inc\n   file.\n   Jalla also expects the define LAPACK_COMPLEX_STRUCTURE
  in the same make.inc.\n   This means that complex numbers are represented as C struct.
  \  \n\n\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\nThe haddock documentation is not complete,
  but not so bad anymore.\nI will add more. The most important things are documented.\n\n\nStatus\n------\nThe
  code may change in some places, and will definitely be growing as soon as I need
  more functionality.\nPlease let me know if you have suggestions.\n\nPlease also
  tell me if you have a greater interest in this project and want to participate!\n\n\nLicense\n-------\nSee
  the file LICENSE.\n\n"
