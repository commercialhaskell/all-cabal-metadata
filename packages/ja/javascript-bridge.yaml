  # javascript-bridge [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/ku-fpg/javascript-bridge.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/ku-fpg/javascript-bridge)

  **javascript-bridge** is a straightforward way of calling JavaScript
  from Haskell, using web-sockets as the underlying transport
  mechanism. Conceptually, javascript-bridge gives Haskell acccess to
  the JavaScript `eval` function.  However, we also support calling and
  returning values from JavaScript functions, constructing and using
  remote objects, and sending events from JavaScript to Haskell, all
  using a remote monad.

  # Overview of API

  **javascript-bridge** remotely executes JavaScript *fragments*.
  The basic Haskell idiom is.
  ```Haskell
       send eng $ command "console.log('Hello!')"
  ```
  where `send` is an `IO` function that sends a commands for remote execution,
  `eng` is a handle into a specific JavaScript engine,
  and `command` is a command builder.

  There are also ways synchronously sending a `procedure`,
  that is a JavaScript expression that constructs a value,
  then returns the resulting value.

  ```Haskell
    do xs :: String <- send eng $ procedure "new Date().toLocaleTimeString()"
       print xs
  ```

  There are ways of creating remote values, for future use,
  where Haskell has a handle for this remote value.

  ```Haskell
  data Date = Date -- phantom

    do t :: RemoteValue Date <- send eng $ constructor "new Date()"
       send eng $ procedure $ "console.log(" <> var t <> ".toLocaleTimeString())"
  ```

  Finally, there is a way of sending events from JavaScript,
  then listening for the event in Haskell.

  ```Haskell
    do -- Have JavaScript send an event to Haskell
       send eng $ command $ event ('Hello!'::String)"
       -- Have Haskell wait for the event, which is an Aeson 'Value'.
       e :: Value <- listen eng
       print e
  ```

  # Bootstrapping

  Bootstrapping the connection is straightforward.
  First, use a `middleware` to setup the (Haskell) server.

  ```Haskell
  import Network.JavaScript

          ...
          scotty 3000 $ do
            middleware $ start app
            ...

  app :: Engine -> IO ()
  app eng = send eng $ command "console.log('Hello!')"
  ```

  Next, include the following fragment in your HTML code.

  ```HTML
      <script>
          window.jsb = {ws: new WebSocket('ws://' + location.host)};
          jsb.ws.onmessage = (evt) => eval(evt.data);
      </script>
  ```

  That's it!
