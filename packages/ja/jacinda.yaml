  Jacinda is a functional pattern filtering language,
  inspired by [AWK](http://www.awklang.org).

  # Installation

  ## Releases

  There are binaries for some platforms on the [releases page](https://github.com/vmchale/jacinda/releases/).

  If you are on Mac, you will need to install `*-librure.dylib` as well.

  ## Nix

  Jacinda is available as a [Nix package](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&from=0&size=1&type=packages&query=jacinda) (thanks to Lukas Epple, who is the maintainer).

  ## From Source

  First, install [Rust's regex library](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/tree/master/regex-capi#c-api-for-rusts-regex-engine). You'll need to put `librure.so` or `librure.dylib` etc. in the appropriate place.

  If you have [cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) and [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) installed (perhaps via [ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/)):

  ```
  cabal install jacinda
  ```

  ## Editor Support

  There is a [vim plugin](https://github.com/vmchale/jacinda-vim) and a [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vmchale.jacinda).

  # Usefulness

  Unix uses record separators in many places; we can display one entry in the
  `PATH` variable with:

  ```
  echo $PATH | ja -F: "{|[x+'\n'+y]|>\`$}"
  ```

  Many Unix tools output information separated with spaces. We use regular
  expressions to match relevant lines and then select the field with the data
  itself, viz.

  ```
  otool -l $(locate libpng.dylib) | ja '{`1 ~ /^name/}{`2}'
  ```

  To get the value of a variable (say, `PATH`) from the output of `printenv`:

  ```
  printenv | ja -F= '{%/^PATH/}{`2}'
  ```

  # Documentation

  See the [guide](https://vmchale.github.io/jacinda/) (archived on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/jacinda/src/doc/guide.pdf), which contains a tutorial
  on some of the features as well as examples.

  The [manpages](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/jacinda/src/man/ja.1) document the builtins and provide a syntax reference.

  See the [rosetta](./ROSETTA.md) showing AWK alongside, or the [examples][./EXAMPLES.md] for its own capabilities.

  # Status

  ## Missing Features & Bugs

    * No nested dfns
    * No list literal syntax
    * Postfix `:f` and `:i` are handled poorly
    * Streams of functions don't work
    * Higher-order functions are subtly broken

  Intentionally missing features:

    * No loops

  # Advantages

    * [Rust's regular expressions](https://docs.rs/regex/)
      - extensively documented with Unicode support
    * Deduplicate builtin

  # Contributing

  I have rewritten the code several times so forking and applying patches is fraught!

  Bug reports are welcome contributions.
