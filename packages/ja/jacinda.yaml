    * Generalize type of `\.` (prior)
    * Reintroduce monomorphism restriction (oops)
    * Better errors for ambiguous types
    * Multiple folds no longer blow up memory in some cases

  Jacinda is a functional, expression-oriented data processing language,
  complementing [AWK](http://www.awklang.org).

  # Installation

  ## Releases

  There are binaries for some platforms on the [releases page](https://github.com/vmchale/jacinda/releases/).

  If you are on Mac, you will need to install `*-librure.dylib` as well.

  ## From Source

  First, install [Rust's regex library](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/tree/master/regex-capi#c-api-for-rusts-regex-engine). You'll need to put `librure.so` or `librure.dylib` etc. in the appropriate place.

  If you have [cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) and [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) installed (perhaps via [ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/)):

  ```
  cabal install jacinda
  ```

  ## Vim Plugin

  There is a [vim plugin](https://github.com/vmchale/jacinda-vim).

  # SHOCK & AWE

  ```
  curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/master/latest/now-weekly-breakthrough.csv | \
      ja ',[1.0-x%y] {ix>1}{`5:} {ix>1}{`17:}' -F,
  ```

  ## Rosetta

  Replace

  ```awk
  NF == 1 && $1 != "}" {
    haveversion[$1] = 1
  }
  END {
    for (i in haveversion)
      printf "have-%s = yes\n", i
  }
  ```

  with

  ```
  (sprintf 'have-%s = yes')" ~.{nf=1 & `1 != '}'}{`1}
  ```

  # Documentation

  See the [guide](https://vmchale.github.io/jacinda/), which contains a tutorial
  on some of the features as well as examples.

  The manpages document the builtins and provide a syntax reference.

  # Status

  The project is in beta, it doesn't necessarily work and there are many
  missing features, but the language will remain stable.

  It is worse than awk but it has its place and it avoids some of the painful
  imperative/scoping defects.

  ## Missing Features & Bugs

    * No nested dfns
    * Obscure renamer edge cases during evaluation
    * `printf` formatting for floats
    * No list literal syntax
    * Typeclasses are not documented
    * Postfix `:f` and `:i` are handled poorly
    * Polymorphic functions can't be instantiated with separate types (global
      monomorphism restriction)
    * Expressions with multiple folds blow up in memory sometimes

  Intentionally missing features:

    * No loops

  # Advantages

    * [Rust's regular expressions](https://docs.rs/regex/)
      - extensively documented with Unicode support
    * Deduplicate builtin
