  # Jalaali Haskell

  Functions for working with Jalaali (Jalali, Persian, Khayyami, Khorshidi, Shamsi) calendar systems.

  ## About

  Jalali calendar is a solar calendar that was used in Persia, variants of which today are still in use in Iran as well as Afghanistan. [Read more on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalali_calendar) or see [Calendar Converter](http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/calendar/).

  Calendar conversion is based on the [algorithm provided by Kazimierz M. Borkowski](http://www.astro.uni.torun.pl/~kb/Papers/EMP/PersianC-EMP.htm) and has a very good performance.
