description: ! "# `jammittools`\n\n[![Available on Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/jammittools.svg)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/jammittools)\n\nA
  command-line tool for exporting sheet music and audio from the (defunct) Windows/Mac
  app [Jammit].\nIt should go without saying, but please do not distribute content
  from songs you have purchased—it is for your use only!\n\n[Jammit]: https://www.jammit.com/\n\n##
  Easy export instructions\n\n1. Download songs through the Windows or Mac Jammit
  app.\n\n2. Download `jammittools` from the [releases page](https://github.com/mtolly/jammittools/releases).\n\n3.
  Unzip somewhere, and run the included `easy-export` script. Song folders will start
  being extracted in that same folder.\n\n## Command-line instructions\n\n    jammittools
  -?\n    # Print usage info.\n\n    jammittools -d\n    # Displays the entire library.\n\n
  \   jammittools -t \"My Song\" -r \"Some Artist\" -x dir\n    # Easiest export option:
  exports all sheet music and audio for a song.\n\n    jammittools -t \"My Song\"
  -r \"Some Artist\" -s file.pdf -y <parts>\n    # Exports a single sheet music file
  with a list of parts, interleaved.\n    # See below for the syntax of instrument
  parts.\n\n    jammittools -t \"My Song\" -r \"Some Artist\" -a file.wav -y <parts>\n
  \   # Exports a single audio file with a list of parts, mixed together.\n    # See
  below for the syntax of instrument parts.\n\n    jammittools -t \"My Song\" -r \"Some
  Artist\" -m file.wav\n    # Exports the metronome click track for the song.\n\n
  \   jammittools -t \"My Song\" -r \"Some Artist\" -c -y <parts>\n    # Do a \"dry
  run\" of audio extraction, which checks if the parts exist\n    # but does not do
  any conversion. Exits with a non-zero code if any\n    # part does not exist.\n\n
  \   jammittools -b dir\n    # Full library backup: runs -x for each song in your
  library.\n    # Each song is extracted to its own folder within \"dir\".\n\nOther
  lesser-used flags:\n\n    -j /path/to/jammit/lib\n    # On Windows and OS X, the
  official app's library location is used\n    # if you do not specify this flag.\n
  \   # You can also specify the environment variable JAMMIT.\n\n    -T \"My Song\"\n
  \   # Exact search on title, instead of -t which is case-insensitive substring.\n\n
  \   -R \"Some Artist\"\n    # Exact search on artist, instead of -r which is case-insensitive
  substring.\n\n    -n <parts>\n    # Allows you to invert certain audio parts when
  exporting a WAV file.\n    # This can be used to access \"hidden\" parts that aren't
  a part of any\n    # transcribed instrument part, see below.\n\n    -l <number>\n
  \   # Select the number of sheet music systems per page.\n    # One system contains
  a line from each individual part.\n    # If this flag is not given, an appropriate
  number of systems will be chosen\n    # to get close to an 8.5\" by 11\" page ratio.\n\nInstrument
  parts are given by this somewhat terse syntax:\n\n    g - Guitar (1)\n    r - Guitar
  2\n    b - Bass (1)\n    a - Bass 2\n    d - Drums (1)\n    m - Drums 2\n    k -
  Keyboard (1)\n    y - Keyboard 2\n    p - Piano\n    s - Synth\n    o - Organ\n
  \   v - Vocals (Lead)\n    x - Vocals (Backing)\n    GRBA - in sheet music, tab
  instead of notation\n    GBDKV - in audio, the backing track for an instrument\n\nSo,
  for example, to make a backing track consisting of just drums and bass:\n\n    jammittools
  <search parameters> -a out.wav -y db\n\nTo make a sheet music file with Guitar 1's
  notation and tab interleaved:\n\n    jammittools <search parameters> -s out.pdf
  -y gG\n\n## Accessing hidden parts\n\nNot all the audio in a song has been transcribed
  and sold by Jammit. Things such\nas sound-effects, other instruments like violin,
  and occasionally third guitar\nor keyboard parts are \"hidden\" inside the backing
  tracks for every instrument\npackage that you can purchase. You can listen to these
  parts by performing\naudio subtraction, where you take two audio files, invert one
  of them, and then\nmix them together.\n\nLet's say you own all 5 instruments for
  a song. You can access the \"hidden\"\ntrack with a command similar to the following:\n\n
  \   jammittools <search parameters> -a out.wav -y D -n grbkyvx\n\nThis uses the
  `-n` flag to mix many audio files in after inverting them.\nThe `D` part is the
  backing track for the drums package. What this does is\nsubtract the non-drums instrument
  parts from this backing track, leaving you\nwith just the portion of the song that
  isn't present in any of the transcribed\nparts. If you use the `-x` or `-b` options
  to export all parts of a song, this\nprocess will be done for you and placed in
  a file called `backing.wav`.\n\nThe resulting file has a thin layer of noise, because
  all the audio used in\nJammit is lossily encoded, which means the backing tracks
  are not quite perfect\nmixes of their constituent parts. But the results are generally
  pretty good,\nand you can easily use something like [Audacity]'s noise filter to
  clean it up\nfurther. Using the drums backing track as a base is preferred, because
  drums\nleaves the most audible noise when you remove it from a different backing
  track.\n\n[Audacity]: http://audacity.sourceforge.net/\n"
