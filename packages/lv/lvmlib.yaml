  The Lazy Virtual Machine (LVM) defines a portable instruction set and file
  format. It is specifically designed to execute languages with non-strict (or
  lazy) semantics. This cabal package defines the core assembler (coreasm) for
  compiling core programs into LVM instructions and a library. The LVM is used
  as a backend for the Helium compiler. At the moment, one LVM runtime
  implementation is available (written in C). More information about LVM can be
  found in Chapter 6 of Daan Leijen's PhD Thesis, The Lambda Abroad.
