  ### 1.6.2

  - Fixed validation of server certificates by name (versions *1.6* and *1.6.1*
    had no chance to work with *https* as it was expected because of this bug).
  - *New feature*: take the host name from the bound server name in the Nginx
    upstream configuration when the service key ends with a slash and this is the
    only slash inside it.
    + **Breaking changes**: internal Haskell/C interoperability protocol has
      changed which requires rebuilding of the C plugin.

  ### 1.6.1

  - Extract host names from service keys and use them in header *Host* and for
    validation of server certificates in health checks over *https*.
  - Conditional building of the *https* support controlled by Cabal flag
    *HealthcheckHttps*.

  ### 1.6

  - Added support for *https* transport protocol.
    + **Breaking changes**: endpoint configuration gets a new field *epProto*,
      see updated examples in the project's *README.md*.
  - A new approach to building custom handlers with Cabal Nix-style local builds
    and [*ngx-export-distribution*](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ngx-export-distribution),
    see details in the project's *simple/*, *periodic/*, and *prometheus/*
    subdirectories.
  - Improvement: using a single http manager for all service keys.

  ### 1.5

  - Refactoring of type imports.
