description: |-
  This was an attempt to submit a ludum dare entry in 2h.
  It is also a nice kata (exercise) for practising haskell game development
  and/or demonstrating different libraries and approaches.
  Improvements, new implementations and co-developers are welcome.

  Currently there is one implementation, a minimal ansi command line one.
  See README for more.
