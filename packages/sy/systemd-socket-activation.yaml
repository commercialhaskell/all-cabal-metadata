  "Socket activation" is the a feature of systemd. ([documentation])

  We use it for web servers, to avoid the momentary downtime that otherwise occurs
  while restarting processes. Because the socket is manged by systemd, not by our
  process, the socket remains even while our process is down. Requests to the
  socket are queued until our process comes back up to respond.
