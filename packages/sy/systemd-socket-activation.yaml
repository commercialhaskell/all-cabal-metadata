  "Socket activation" is the a feature of systemd.

  https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/sd_listen_fds_with_names.html

  We use it for web servers, to avoid the momentary downtime
  that otherwise occurs while restarting processes.
  Because the socket is manged by systemd, not by our process,
  the socket remains even while our process is down.
  Requests to the socket are queued until our process comes
  back up to respond.
