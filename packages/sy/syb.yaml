description: "syb: Scrap Your Boilerplate!\n================================================================================\n\nScrap
  Your Boilerplate (SYB) is a library for generic programming in Haskell. It \nis
  supported since the GHC >= 6.0 implementation of Haskell. Using this \napproach,
  you can write generic functions such as traversal schemes (e.g., \neverywhere and
  everything), as well as generic read, generic show and generic \nequality (i.e.,
  gread, gshow, and geq). This approach is based on just a few \nprimitives for type-safe
  cast and processing constructor applications. \n\nIt was originally developed by
  Ralf LÃ¤mmel and Simon Peyton Jones. Since then,\nmany people have contributed with
  research relating to SYB or its applications. \n\nMore information is available
  on the webpage: \nhttp://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/GenericProgramming/SYB\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n*
  Easy generic programming with combinators\n* GHC can derive Data and Typeable instances
  for your datatypes\n* Comes with many useful generic functions\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n*
  GHC 6.10.1 or later\n* Cabal 1.6 or later\n\n\nBugs & Support\n--------------\n\nPlease
  report issues or request features at the bug tracker:\n\n  https://github.com/dreixel/syb/issues\n\nFor
  discussion about the library with the authors, maintainers, and other\ninterested
  persons use the mailing list:\n\n  http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/generics\n"
