description: "### Main differences with respect to `ParsleyHaskell`\n\n- Tagless-final
  and `DefaultSignatures` are used instead of tagfull-final to handle recursion schemes,
  this avoids constructing and deconstructing as much tags when transforming combinators
  or instructions.\n  And structures/simplifies the code by avoiding to define custom
  traversals (`traverseCombinator`) or custom fix-point data-types (`Fix4`) and associated
  utilities (`cata4`) when introducing new index-types. \n  Note that the extensibility
  of combinators, a great feature of tagless-final, is not really achievable when
  using the optimizing pass which requires a comprehensive initial encoding.\n\n-
  No dependency on `dependent-map` by keeping observed sharing inside `def` and `ref`
  combinators, instead of passing by a `DMap`. Same for join-points, where `TemplateHaskell`
  names are also directly used instead of passing by a `DMap`.\n\n- No dependency
  on GHC plugins: `lift-plugin` and `idioms-plugin`, because those are plugins hence
  introduce a bit of complexity in the build processes using this parser, but most
  importantly they are experimental and only cosmetic, since they only enable a cleaner
  usage of the parsing combinators, by lifting Haskell code in `pure` to integrate
  the `TemplateHaskell` needed. I do not understand them that much and do not feel
  confortable to maintain them in case their authors abandon them.\n\n- Error messages
  based upon the farthest input position reached (not yet implemented in `ParsleyHaskell`).\n\n-
  License is `GPL-3.0-or-later` not `BSD-3-Clause`.\n\n### Main goals\n\n- For me
  to better understand `ParsleyHaskell`, and find a manageable balance between simplicity
  of the codebase and features of the parser.\n\n- To support parsing tree-like data
  structures (like XML or HTTP routes) instead of just string-like data structures,
  which I've done using `megaparsec`, but it is not conceived for such input, and
  is less principled when it comes to optimizing, like merging alternatives.\n"
