description: |-
  Simple library for using the system's monotonic clock.  This library is
  geared toward programs that need to run for long periods of time.  It does
  not (necessarily) provide high-resolution timing.

  * On Windows, this uses @GetTickCount64@, but falls back to
  @GetTickCount@ if it is not available.  @GetTickCount64@ was
  introduced in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.
  Support for @QueryPerformanceCounter@ is also available, but is not
  used by default, as it is less accurate in the long run than
  @GetTickCount@.

  * On Linux, this uses @clock_gettime@ with @CLOCK_MONOTONIC@.

  Release history:

  [0.2] Update driver API (@SystemClock@) to prevent cumulative precision loss.

  [0.1] Initial release.
