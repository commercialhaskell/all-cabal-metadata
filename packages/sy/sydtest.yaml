  # Changelog

  ## [0.12.0.0] - Unreleased

  ### Added

  * Automatic flakiness diagnostics, see the `README`
    This adds the `potentiallyFlaky` and `potentiallyFlakyWith` functions.
  * `Test.Syd` now also exports `pPrint`.
  * The `modifyRetries`, `withoutRetries`, `withRetries` functions, to allow configuration of the number of retries independently of whether flakiness is allowed.
  * The `TestRunReport` type, so that a `ResultForest` contains information about all runs of a test instead of only the last.
  * Expectation of failure.
    This adds the `expectFailing`, `expectPassing`, and `withExpectationMode` functions.

  ### Changed

  * Fixed: Fail-fast now works correctly together with fail-on-flaky
  * Fixed that flags with a `no-` prefix did not parse correctly and could therefore not be used.
  * The `FlakinessMode` type no longer contains a number of retries.
    The number of retries is now configured separately.
  * Fixed that `xdescribe` would only result in one pending test instead of the same number of tests as are marked as pending.
  * Fixed that `specify` and `prop` would show a callstack from inside `sydtest` instead of from where you used them.
  * Sydtest now sets the global pseudorandomness seed in the random library to the given seed using `setStdGen` for extra reproducability.

  ### Removed

  ## [0.11.0.2] - 2022-09-7

  ### Changed

  * Added the `shouldMatchList` expectation, corresponding the one from
    `hspec-expectations`.

  ## [0.11.0.1] - 2022-06-28

  ### Changed

  * Made the type of `setupAround` more general.

  ## [0.11.0.0] - 2022-06-28

  ### Changed

  * `printOutputSpecForest` now uses `Data.Text.Lazy.IO` to output the report, so it will try to respect the system's locale.
  * `renderResultReport` now outputs a `Text.Builder` instead of a `ByteString.Builder` and a newline at the end.

  ## [0.10.1.0] - 2022-06-04

  ### Changed

  * Fixed a bug where multiple layers of contextual failures were not unwrapped and shown correctly.
  * Made 'Assertion' fields strict.

  ## [0.10.0.0] - 2022-04-28

  ### Added

  * Allow supplying filters without a flag, so `hello` instead of `--filter hello` or `--match hello`.
  * Simplified the way exceptions work to allow for attaching context to any failure instead of only `Assertion`s.

  ## [0.9.0.0] - 2022-04-13

  ### Added

  * Optional type-safe progress reporting for property tests.

  ## [0.8.0.1] - 2022-02-11

  ### Changed

  * Fixed property tests without labels still showing labels in the output.

  ## [0.8.0.0] - 2022-02-11

  ### Changed

  * The `TestDefM` now contains a `TestDefEnv` which also contains the test description path, along with `TestRunSettings`.
  * Removed the `MonadState ()` instance of `TestDefM`. It was just silly.
  * Changed the internals of `TestDefM` to use `ReaderT` and a strict `WriterT` instead of `RWST`.
  * Renamed `wrapRWST` to `wrapForest`.
  * Fixed the property label output to use the right total.
  * Moved `filterTestForest` and `randomiseTestForest` from `Test.Syd.TestDefM` to `Test.Syd.SpecDef`, where `SpecDefForest` is defined.

  ### Added

  * `getTestDescriptionPath` to get the test description path upwards from inside a test definition.


  ## [0.7.0.1] - 2021-12-23

  ### Changed

  * Fixed `shouldStartWith` to test on the prefix rather then infix

  ## [0.7.0.0] - 2021-12-15

  ### Added

  * Flaky tests now show up in the failure report when `--fail-on-flaky` is active.
  * Flakiness information like the number of retries is now shown in the failure report for real (non-flaky) failures.

  ### Changed

  * Simplified the way settings are passed around.

  ## [0.6.1.0] - 2021-12-10

  ### Added

  * The `flakyWith` combinator, which is like `flaky`, but lets you also add a message to your team.

  ## [0.6.0.0] - 2021-11-12

  ### Changed

  * Started using `autodocodec` instead of `yamlparse-applicative`.

  ## [0.5.0.0] - 2021-11-12

  ### Added

  * The flakiness combinators (`flaky`, `notFlaky`, and `withFlakiness`) to mark a test group as potentially flaky.
  * The `--fail-on-flaky` flag to falsify flakiness.
  * Experimental Windows support

  ### Changed

  * Fixed the interpretation of `max-size` vs `max-success` in the configuration file and environment parsing.

  ## [0.4.1.0] - 2021-10-10

  ### Added

  * The `--random-seed` option to use random seeds instead of the fixed seed that is used by default.

  ## [0.4.0.0] - 2021-09-02

  ### Added

  * The `--debug` option.

  ### Changed

  * Redid the entire flags parsing.
    This should be backward compatible, and result in a nicer `--help` overview.

  ## [0.3.0.3] - 2021-08-07

  ### Changed

  * Show the total number of examples in the output as well

  ## [0.3.0.2] - 2021-07-06

  ### Changed

  * Accept options using American spelling as well.

  ## [0.3.0.1] - 2021-06-20

  ### Changed

  * Turned off shrinking when using `around` and friends. See https://github.com/nick8325/quickcheck/issues/331.

  ## [0.3.0.0] - 2021-06-17

  ### Added

  * An `IsTest (ReaderT env IO a)` instance.

  ### Deleted

  * `Test.Syd.Def.Env`, which contained `eit` and `withTestEnv`
    Now that `ReaderT env IO a` is also in `IsTest`, you can just use `it` for this.

  ## [0.2.0.0] - 2021-06-03

  ### Added

  * `beforeWith` and `beforeWith'`
  * `scenarioDir` and `scenarioDirRecur` for scenario testing.
  * `bracketSetupFunc`

  ### Changed

  * The `SetupFunc` has been simplified to only take one type parameter.

  ### Deleted

  * `composeSetupFunc`, now obsolete: use `<=<` instead.
  * `connectSetupFunc`, now obsolete: use `>=>` instead.
  * `wrapSetupFunc`, now entirely obsolete.
  * `unwrapSetupFunc`, now entirely obsolete.
  * `makeSimpleSetupFunc`, now obsolete: Use the `SetupFunc` constructor directly.
  * `useSimpleSetupFunc`, now obsolete: Use the `unSetupFunc` function directly.
