description: |
  Provides an instance that translates
  haskell-src-exts expression trees into Template Haskell expression
  trees in a way that depends only on the haskell-src-exts syntax tree
  and agreement on the pretty-printed representation of
  Haskell between haskell-src-exts pretty-printer and
  Template Haskell quotations (as opposed to depending on
  both TH and haskell-src-exts syntax tree representations).

  Instead of converting between data types,
  haskell-src-exts syntax trees are pretty-printed and wrapped in
  a TH quotation which is then interpreted as a Haskell program,
  yielding a TH Exp tree. Free variables in the haskell-src-exts tree are
  preserved by lifting them to TH splices prior to pretty-printing.
