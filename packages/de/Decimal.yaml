changelog: |
  Version 0.2.1
  -------------

  * Fixed `base` dependency.

  * Put test suite under `cabal test`

  Version 0.2.2
  -------------

  * Minor fixes to allow compilation under other versions of GHC.

  Version 0.2.3
  -------------

  * Added instance of `NFData` from `Control.DeepSeq`, and hence a dependency
  on the `deepseq` package, thanks to Jeff Shaw (shawjef3 at msu.edu).

  Version 0.3.1
  -------------

  * Added `Typeable`, `Fractional` and `RealFrac` instances.

  * Multiplication now returns an exact result, increasing precision if necessary.

  These changes alter the API. Hence the increment to the major version number.

  Thanks to Alexey Uimanov (s9gf4ult at gmail.com).

  Version 0.4.1
  -------------

  * Improved `Read` instance. Now handles `"1.2e3"` and `reads` only returns a single parse.

  * Corrected documentation.

  * Added `Enum` instance.

  * `decimalConvert` now returns a Maybe value. The old version has been renamed
  to "unsafeDecimalConvert.

  Version 0.5.1
  -------------

  * Bankers' Rounding implemented in "roundTo". This rounds values ending in "5" to
  the nearest even number, in line with the behaviour of "Prelude.round". This
  is potentially a breaking change for software that depends on the old
  behavior, so the minor version number has been bumped.

  * Added a `stack.yaml` file.

  * Corrected documentation.

  * `Read` instance now handles leading spaces properly.

  * Fixed compiler warnings in test suite.

  * Added `roundTo'` which allows for `truncate`, `floor` and `ceiling` behaviour when rounding.

  Haskell-Decimal
  ===============

  Fixed-precision decimal numbers, where the precision is carried with the numbers at run-time.

  The `Decimal` type is mainly intended for doing financial arithmetic
  where the number of decimal places may not be known at compile time
  (e.g. for a program that handles both Yen and Dollars) and the
  application must not drop pennies on the floor.  For instance if you
  have to divide $10 between three people then one of them has to get
  $3.34.

  The number of decimal places in a value is represented as a Word8,
  allowing for up to 255 decimal places.  Functions preserve precision.
  Addition and subtraction operators return a result with the precision of the most
  precise argument, so 2.3 + 5.678 = 7.978. Multiplication and division use whatever precision is
  necessary up to 255 decimal places.


  QuickCheck Specification
  ------------------------

  Data.Decimal includes a set of QuickCheck properties which act as both
  tests and a formal specification. To run the tests do:

     cabal configure --enable-tests
     cabal build
     cabal test

  or

     stack test
