  * Demangler

  This is a demangler for "mangled" source code names.  A "mangled" name is an
  encoded form of a function or other symbol that includes additional information
  (types, template arguments, etc.) and possibly also compression, such that the
  result is smaller and is entirely comprised of characters that are valiod for a
  simple identifier (alphanumeric characters and underscores).

  C++ is the pre-emininent source of mangled names, although other languages
  perform mangling as well.

  Normal usage of this library will return the original demangled form if the
  demangling fails (usually because of incompleteness in this parser).  There are
  occasional scenarios where the conversion to the string format is incomplete:
  these will generate obviously bad output... let us know what the right output is
  and we'll fix it!

  ** Details

  *** General Implementation

  This library is intended to be used when processing compiled code that contains
  mangled names (e.g. LLVM bitcode, ELF symbol tables, etc.).  When processing
  compiled code, it is not uncommon to encounter upwards of 10-15 thousand mangled
  symbols, all of which may need to be demangled.  To support the primary goals of
  performance and tight memory footprint, this library uses a ~Context~ that is
  essentially a state threaded through the demangling process to normalize
  (i.e. use sharing) textual information.  There are two primary entry points: one
  that demangles a single string and internally creates and discards a ~Context~
  for that single demangling, and one that allows the re-use of a ~Context~, which
  is updated as each name is demangled.

  The demangling process is designed to never fail or throw exceptions: if a name
  cannot be demangled it is assumed to be an unmangled name (or garbage) and the
  original, unmangled form is returned. It is also possible to build this library
  with the debug flag enabled (~$ cabal configure -fdebug~).  In the debug mode,
  the library will panic on unrecognized parse scenarios or unimplemented string
  output forms.  The panic provides additional information to help fix this issue,
  but is obviously a sub-optimal result for production code, so please only use the
  debug mode in appropriate scenarios.

  *** C++

  C++ mangling is a twisted and ill-documented process,
  primarily documented at
  https://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/abi.html#mangling).  There are lots of
  special considerations (e.g. expressions can be template arguments that must be
  mangled, thread-local data and guard variables are encoded), as well as relations
  to C++ syntax (e.g. nested template args require a space between closing '>'
  characters).  This library is NOT YET a complete implementation: there are
  mangled forms that are not correctly parsed and/or printed; expect updates as
  these are encountered and needed (and patches are welcome).

  ** Other options

  This is not the only Haskell demangler library; there is at least one other one
  that is built on the Boomerang parsing library, which has the advantage in that
  it is bi-directional, but the disadvantage that it is slow and uses considerably
  more memory.  These disadvantages become very significant when processing source
  code that contains 10K-15K+ mangled names, ergo this library is *not*
  bi-directional but it *is* oriented towards performance and memory utilization.

  ** Usage

  This is available as a library that can be used by other applications to demangle
  code, and also provides a ~demangle~ application that is the equivalent of the
  ~c++-filt~ application to demangle names provided on the command line or as
  standard input.

  #+begin_example
  $ cabal run demangle _Znwm
  #+end_example

  The output of the demangling function(s) is an AST that represents the name in a
  semantically rich (but messy) manner.  The "sayable" library
  (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sayable) is used convert this AST to an
  actual rich string representation: there is a ~Sayable~ instance for each
  ~(AST_object, Context)~ tuple.  The instances defined support the ~"diagnostic"~
  saytag for obtaining some additional information during output; normally the
  ~"normal"~ saytag should be used.

  #+begin_example
  putStrLn $ sez_ @"normal" $ demangle1 "_Znwm"
  #+end_example

  some.
