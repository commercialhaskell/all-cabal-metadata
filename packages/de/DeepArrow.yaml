description: |-
  This library provides a framework for type-directed composition of value
  editors (non-syntactic transformations).  The tools enable \"deep function
  application\" in two senses: deep application of functions and
  application of deep functions.  These tools generalize beyond values and
  functions, via the @DeepArrow@ subclass of the @Arrow@ type class.

  For more information see:

  * The project wiki page <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/DeepArrow>

  * Application of deep arrows for composable interfaces in the TV library:
  <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/TV>

  * The motivating idea and paper "Tangible Functional Programming":
  <http://conal.net/papers/Eros>

  The primary module is "Control.Arrow.DeepArrow".  Examples in
  "Control.Arrow.DeepArrow.Examples".

  /Note/: Many of the type signatures use infix type operators (as in
  @a~>b@).  In reading the documentation and code, be aware that infix
  operators bind more tightly than @->@.
