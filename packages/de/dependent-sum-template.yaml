  # Revision history for dependent-sum-template

  ## 0.2.0.1 - 2023-12-06

  * Add back support for GHC 9.2 and 9.4.

    We were able to work around [the bug in `reifyInstances`](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23743) by using a data family instead of a type family.

  ## 0.2.0.0 - 2023-08-01

  * Recover compatibility with template-haskell 2.18, which was lost in 0.1.2.0
  * deriveGShow will generate code that uses Show instances for every argument to a constructor, apart from those of the type that it is generating an instance for.
  * Drop support for GHC 9.2 and 9.4 due to [a bug in `reifyInstances`](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/23743)

  ## 0.1.2.0 - 2023-07-11

  * Rework a lot of the logic using th-abstraction to get structural information about data types and to
    normalize their representation. This should allow the deriving functions to work on a much wider range
    of types.

  * Change dependency to just be on `some`, not `dependent-sum`, as we just need the reexported classes.

  ## 0.1.1.1 - 2021-12-30

  * Fix warning with GHC 9.2 about non-canonical `return`.

  ## 0.1.1.0 revision 1 - 2021-11-30

  * Add bound to `th-abstraction` to prevent build failure.

  ## 0.1.1.0 - 2021-11-25

  * Support GHC 9.0

  ## 0.1.0.3 - 2020-03-24

  * Relax version bounds on `dependent-sum` to include 0.7.

  ## 0.1.0.2 - 2020-03-23

  * Update GitHub repository in cabal metadata.

  ## 0.1.0.1 - 2020-03-21

  * Support GHC 8.8.

  ## 0.1.0.0 - 2019-03-21

  * Remove code for generating instances of *Tag classes, as they were removed in dependent-sum-0.6.

  dependent-sum-template [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/obsidiansystems/dependent-sum-template.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/obsidiansystems/dependent-sum-template) [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/dependent-sum-template.svg)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/dependent-sum-template)
  ==============

  This library defines [Template Haskell](https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/users_guide/exts/template_haskell.html) functions for deriving the `GEq`, `GCompare`, `GShow`, and `GRead` functions from the [`some`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/some) library.

   - `GEq tag` is similar to an `Eq` instance for `tag a` except that with `geq`, values of types `tag a` and `tag b` may be compared, and in the case of equality, evidence that the types `a` and `b` are equal is provided.

   - `GCompare tag` is similar to the above for `Ord`, and provides `gcompare`, giving a `GOrdering` that gives similar evidence of type equality when values match.

   - `GShow tag` means that `tag a` has (the equivalent of) a `Show` instance.

   - `GRead tag` means that `tag a` has (the equivalent of) a `Read` instance.
