description: "# dep-t\r\n\r\n`DepT` is a\r\n[ReaderT](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl-2.2.2/docs/Control-Monad-Reader.html)-like\r\nmonad
  transformer for dependency injection.\r\n\r\nThe difference with `ReaderT` is that
  `DepT` takes an enviroment whose type is\r\nparameterized by `DepT` itself.\r\n\r\n##
  Rationale\r\n\r\nTo perform dependency injection in Haskell, a common solution is
  to build a\r\nrecord of functions and pass it to the program logic using some variant
  of\r\n[`ReaderT`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl-2.2.2/docs/Control-Monad-Reader.html).\r\n\r\nTo
  avoid becoming tied to a concrete reader environment, let's define some\r\nauxiliary
  typeclasses that extract functions from a generic environment:\r\n\r\n    type HasLogger
  :: (Type -> Type) -> Type -> Constraint\r\n    class HasLogger d e | e -> d where\r\n
  \     logger :: e -> String -> d ()\r\n\r\n    type HasRepository :: (Type -> Type)
  -> Type -> Constraint\r\n    class HasRepository d e | e -> d where\r\n      repository
  :: e -> Int -> d ()\r\n\r\nWe see that the type `e` of the environment determines
  the monad `d` on which\r\nthe effects take place.\r\n\r\nHere's a monomorphic environment
  record with functions that have effects in `IO`:\r\n\r\n    type EnvIO :: Type\r\n
  \   data EnvIO = EnvIO\r\n      { _loggerIO :: String -> IO (),\r\n        _repositoryIO
  :: Int -> IO ()\r\n      }\r\n\r\n    instance HasLogger IO EnvIO where\r\n      logger
  = _loggerIO\r\n\r\n    instance HasRepository IO EnvIO where\r\n      repository
  = _repositoryIO\r\n\r\n[Record-of-functions-in-IO](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2017/06/readert-design-pattern/)
  is a simple technique which works well in many\r\nsituations. There are even [specialized\r\nlibraries](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio)
  that support it.\r\n\r\nHere's a function which can get its dependencies from the
  monomorphic\r\nenvironment:\r\n\r\n    mkControllerIO :: (HasLogger IO e, HasRepository
  IO e) => Int -> ReaderT e IO String\r\n    mkControllerIO x = do\r\n      e <- ask\r\n
  \     liftIO $ logger e \"I'm going to insert in the db!\"\r\n      liftIO $ repository
  e x\r\n      return \"view\"\r\n\r\nThat's all and well, but there are two issues
  that bug me:\r\n\r\n- We might want to write code that is innocent of `IO` and polymorphic
  over the\r\n  monad, to ensure that the program logic can't do some unexpected missile\r\n
  \ launch, or to allow testing our app in a \"pure\" way. \r\n\r\n- What if the repository
  function needs access to the logger, too? The\r\n  repository lives in the environment
  record, but isn't aware of it. That means\r\n  it can't use the `HasLogger` typeclass
  for easy and convenient dependency\r\n  injection. Why privilege the controller
  in such a way?\r\n\r\n  In a sufficiently complex app, the diverse functions that
  comprise it will be\r\n  organized in a big\r\n  [DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)
  of dependencies.\r\n  And it would be nice if all the functions taking part in dependency
  injection\r\n  were treated uniformly; if all of them had access to (some view of)
  the\r\n  environment record.\r\n\r\nTo tackle these issues, we begin by giving the
  controller a more general signature:\r\n\r\n    mkControllerIO :: (HasLogger IO
  e, HasRepository IO e, MonadIO m, MonadReader e m) => Int -> m String\r\n\r\nNow
  the function can work in other reader-like monads besides `ReaderT`.\r\n\r\nLet's
  go one step further, and abstract away the `IO`, so that functions in the\r\nrecord
  can have effects in other monads:\r\n\r\n    mkController :: (HasLogger d e, HasRepository
  d e, LiftDep d m, MonadReader e m) => Int -> m String\r\n    mkController x = do\r\n
  \     e <- ask\r\n      liftD $ logger e \"I'm going to insert in the db!\"\r\n
  \     liftD $ repository e x\r\n      return \"view\"\r\n\r\nNow both the signature
  and the implementation have changed:\r\n\r\n- There's a new type variable `d`, the
  monad in which functions taken from the\r\n  environment `e` have their effects.\r\n\r\n-
  `MonadIO` has been replaced by `LiftDep` from `Control.Monad.Dep.Class`, a\r\n  constraint
  that says we can lift `d` effects into `m` (though it could still\r\n  make sense
  to require `MonadIO m` for effects not originating in the\r\n  environment).\r\n\r\n-
  Uses of `liftIO` have been replaced by `liftD`.\r\n\r\nIf all those constraints
  prove annoying to write, there's a convenient shorthand using the `MonadDep` type
  family:\r\n\r\n    mkController :: MonadDep [HasLogger, HasRepository] d e m =>
  Int -> m String\r\n\r\nThe new, more polymorphic `mkController` function can replace
  the original `mkControllerIO`:\r\n\r\n    mkControllerIO' :: (HasLogger IO e, HasRepository
  IO e) => Int -> ReaderT e IO String\r\n    mkControllerIO' = mkController\r\n\r\nNow
  let's focus on the environment record. We'll parameterize its type by a\r\nmonad:
  \r\n\r\n    type Env :: (Type -> Type) -> Type\r\n    data Env m = Env\r\n      {
  _logger :: String -> m (),\r\n        _repository :: Int -> m (),\r\n        _controller
  :: Int -> m String\r\n      }\r\n\r\n    instance HasLogger m (Env m) where\r\n
  \     logger = _logger\r\n\r\n    instance HasRepository m (Env m) where\r\n      repository
  = _repository\r\n\r\nNotice that the controller function is now part of the environment.
  No\r\nfavorites here!\r\n\r\nThe following implementation of the logger function
  has no dependencies besides\r\n`MonadIO`:\r\n\r\n    mkStdoutLogger :: MonadIO m
  => String -> m ()\r\n    mkStdoutLogger msg = liftIO (putStrLn msg)\r\n\r\nBut look
  at this implementation of the repository function. It gets hold of the\r\nlogger
  through `HasLogger`, just as the controller did:\r\n\r\n    mkStdoutRepository ::
  (MonadDep '[HasLogger] d e m, MonadIO m) => Int -> m ()\r\n    mkStdoutRepository
  entity = do\r\n      e <- ask\r\n      liftD $ logger e \"I'm going to write the
  entity!\"\r\n      liftIO $ print entity\r\n\r\nIt's about time we choose a concrete
  monad and assemble an environment record:\r\n\r\n    envIO :: Env (DepT Env IO)\r\n
  \   envIO =\r\n      let _logger = mkStdoutLogger\r\n          _repository = mkStdoutRepository\r\n
  \         _controller = mkController\r\n       in Env {_logger,  _repository, _controller}\r\n\r\nNot
  very complicated, except... what is that weird `DepT Env IO` doing there in\r\nthe
  signature? \r\n\r\nWell, that's the whole reason this library exists. For dependency
  injection to\r\nwork for *all* functions, `Env` needs to be parameterized with a
  monad that\r\nprovides that same `Env` environment. And trying to use a `ReaderT
  (Env\r\nsomething) IO` to parameterize `Env` won't fly; you'll get weird \"infinite\r\ntype\"
  kind of errors. So I created the `DepT` newtype over `ReaderT` to mollify\r\nthe
  compiler.\r\n\r\n`DepT` has `MonadReader` and `LiftDep` instances, so the effects
  of\r\n`mkController` can take place on it.\r\n\r\n## So how do we invoke the controller
  now?\r\n\r\nI suggest something like\r\n\r\n    runDepT (do e <- ask; _controller
  e 7) envIO \r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n    (do e <- ask; _controller e 7) `runDepT` envIO
  \r\n\r\nThe companion package\r\n[dep-t-advice](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/dep-t-advice)
  has some more\r\nfunctions for running `DepT` computations.\r\n\r\n## How to avoid
  using \"ask\" and \"liftD\" before invoking a dependency?\r\n\r\nOne possible workaround
  (at the cost of more boilerplate) is to define helper\r\nfunctions like:  \r\n\r\n
  \   loggerD :: MonadDep '[HasLogger] d e m => String -> m ()\r\n    loggerD msg
  = asks logger >>= \\f -> liftD $ f msg\r\n\r\nWhich you can invoke like this:\r\n\r\n
  \   usesLoggerD :: MonadDep [HasLogger, HasRepository] d e m => Int -> m String\r\n
  \   usesLoggerD i = do\r\n      loggerD \"I'm calling the logger!\"\r\n      return
  \"foo\"\r\n\r\nThough perhaps this isn't worth the hassle.\r\n\r\n## How to use
  \"pure fakes\" during testing?\r\n\r\nThe [test suite](./test/tests.hs) has an example
  of using a `Writer` monad for\r\ncollecting the outputs of functions working as
  [\"test\r\ndoubles\"](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html).\r\n\r\n##
  How to make a function \"see\" a different evironment from the one seen by its dependencies?\r\n\r\nSometimes
  we want a function in the environment to see a slightly different\r\nrecord from
  the record seen by the other functions, and in particular from the\r\nrecord seen
  by its own dependencies. \r\n\r\nFor example, the function might have a `HasLogger`
  constraint but we don't want\r\nit to use the default `HasLogger` instance of the
  environment.\r\n\r\nThe companion package\r\n[dep-t-advice](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/dep-t-advice)
  provides a\r\n`deceive` function that allows for this.\r\n\r\n## How to add AOP-ish
  \"aspects\" to functions in an environment?\r\n\r\nThe companion package\r\n[dep-t-advice](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/dep-t-advice)
  provides a\r\ngeneral method of extending the behaviour of `DepT`-effectful functions,
  in a\r\nway reminiscent of aspect-oriented programming.\r\n\r\n## Caveats\r\n\r\nThe
  structure of the `DepT` type might be prone to trigger a [known infelicity\r\nof
  the GHC\r\nsimplifier](https://twitter.com/DiazCarrete/status/1350116413445439493).\r\n\r\n##
  Links\r\n\r\n- This library was extracted from my answer to [this Stack Overflow\r\n
  \ question](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61782258/1364288).\r\n\r\n- The implementation
  of `mapDepT` was teased out in [this other SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65710657/writing-a-zooming-function-for-a-readert-like-monad-transformer).\r\n\r\n-
  An [SO\r\n  answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57703898/how-to-call-impure-functions-from-pure-ones/57714058#57714058)\r\n
  \ about records-of-functions and the \"veil of polymorphism\".\r\n\r\n- The answers
  to [this SO\r\n  question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61642492/simplifying-the-invocation-of-functions-stored-inside-an-readert-environment)\r\n
  \ gave me the idea for how to \"instrument\" monadic functions (although the\r\n
  \ original motive of the question was different).\r\n\r\n- I'm unsure of the relationship
  between `DepT` and the technique described in\r\n  [Adventures assembling records
  of\r\n  capabilities](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/adventures-assembling-records-of-capabilities/623)\r\n
  \ which relies on having \"open\" and \"closed\" versions of the environment\r\n
  \ record. \r\n\r\n  It seems that, with `DepT`, functions in the environment obtain
  their\r\n  dependencies anew every time they are invoked. If we change a function
  in the\r\n  environment record, all other functions which depend on it will be affected\r\n
  \ in subsequent invocations. I don't think this happens with \"Adventures...\" at\r\n
  \ least when changing a \"closed\", already assembled record.\r\n\r\n  With `DepT`
  a function might use `local` if it knows enough about the\r\n  environment. That
  doesn't seem very useful for program logic; if fact it\r\n  sounds like a recipe
  for confusion. It could perhaps be useful for [AOP-ish\r\n  things](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/dep-t-advice),
  to keep a synthetic\r\n  \"call stack\", or to implement something like Logback's
  [Mapped Diagnostic\r\n  Context](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/mdc.html).\r\n\r\n
  \ So perhaps `DepT` will be overkill in a lot of cases, offering unneeded\r\n  flexibility.
  [This\r\n  gist](https://gist.github.com/danidiaz/358fdccdef51ad37bbec932631dcc4d2)\r\n
  \ contains an example of `DepT`-less and `ReaderT`-less dependency injection.\r\n
  \ It does use `Control.Monad.Dep.Has`, in combination with \"open\" and \"closed\"\r\n
  \ versions of the environment record. Unlike in \"Adventures...\" the gist\r\n  doesn't
  use an extensible record for the environment but, to keep things\r\n  simple, a
  suitably parameterized conventional one.\r\n\r\n- Another exploration of dependency
  injection with `ReaderT`:\r\n  [ReaderT-OpenProduct-Environment](https://github.com/keksnicoh/ReaderT-OpenProduct-Environment).\r\n\r\n-
  [The ReaderT design pattern](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2017/06/readert-design-pattern/).\r\n\r\n>
  Your application code will, in general, live in ReaderT Env IO. Define it as type
  App = ReaderT Env IO if you wish, or use a newtype wrapper instead of ReaderT directly.\r\n\r\n>
  Optional: instead of directly using the App datatype, write your functions in terms
  of mtl-style typeclasses like MonadReader and MonadIO\r\n\r\n- [RIO](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio)
  is a featureful ReaderT-like /\r\n  prelude replacement library which favors monomorphic
  environments.\r\n\r\n- The [van Laarhoven Free Monad](http://r6.ca/blog/20140210T181244Z.html).\r\n\r\n>
  Swierstra notes that by summing together functors representing primitive I/O\r\n>
  actions and taking the free monad of that sum, we can produce values use\r\n> multiple
  I/O feature sets. Values defined on a subset of features can be\r\n> lifted into
  the free monad generated by the sum. The equivalent process can\r\n> be performed
  with the van Laarhoven free monad by taking the product of\r\n> records of the primitive
  operations. Values defined on a subset of features\r\n> can be lifted by composing
  the van Laarhoven free monad with suitable\r\n> projection functions that pick out
  the requisite primitive operations. \r\n\r\n- [Interesting SO response](https://stackoverflow.com/a/634754/1364288)
  (from\r\n  2009) about the benefits of autowiring in Spring. The record-of-functions\r\n
  \ approach in Haskell can't be said to provide true autowiring. You still need\r\n
  \ to assemble the record manually, and field names in the record play the part\r\n
  \ of Spring bean names. \r\n\r\n> Right now I think the most important reason for
  using autowiring is that\r\n> there's one less abstraction in your system to keep
  track of. The \"bean name\"\r\n> is effectively gone. It turns out the bean name
  only exists because of xml. So\r\n> a full layer of abstract indirections (where
  you would wire bean-name \"foo\"\r\n> into bean \"bar\") is gone\r\n\r\n- [registry](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/registry)
