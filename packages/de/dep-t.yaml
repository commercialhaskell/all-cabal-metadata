description: "# dep-t\r\n\r\n`DepT` is a\r\n[ReaderT](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl-2.2.2/docs/Control-Monad-Reader.html)-like\r\nmonad
  transformer for dependency injection.\r\n\r\nThe difference with `ReaderT` is that
  `DepT` takes an enviroment whose type is\r\nparameterized by `DepT` itself.\r\n\r\n##
  Rationale\r\n\r\nTo achieve dependency injection in Haskell, a common solution is
  to build a\r\nrecord of functions and pass it to the program logic using some variant
  of\r\n[`ReaderT`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl-2.2.2/docs/Control-Monad-Reader.html).\r\n\r\nLet's
  start by defining some auxiliary typeclasses to extract functions from an\r\nenvironment
  record:\r\n\r\n    type HasLogger :: Type -> (Type -> Type) -> Constraint\r\n    class
  HasLogger r m | r -> m where\r\n      logger :: r -> String -> m ()\r\n\r\n    type
  HasRepository :: Type -> (Type -> Type) -> Constraint\r\n    class HasRepository
  r m | r -> m where\r\n      repository :: r -> Int -> m ()\r\n\r\nWe see that the
  type of the record determines the monad in which the effects take place.\r\n\r\nLet's
  define a monomorphic record with effects in `IO`:\r\n\r\n    type EnvIO :: Type\r\n
  \   data EnvIO = EnvIO\r\n      { _loggerIO :: String -> IO (),\r\n        _repositoryIO
  :: Int -> IO ()\r\n      }\r\n\r\n    instance HasLogger EnvIO IO where\r\n      logger
  = _loggerIO\r\n\r\n    instance HasRepository EnvIO IO where\r\n      repository
  = _repositoryIO\r\n\r\nRecord-of-functions-in-IO is a simple technique which works
  well in many\r\nsituations. There are even [specialized\r\nlibraries](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio)
  that support it.\r\n\r\nHere's a function which obtains its dependencies from the
  environment record:\r\n\r\n    mkControllerIO :: (HasLogger e IO, HasRepository
  e IO) => Int -> ReaderT e IO String\r\n    mkControllerIO x = do\r\n      e <- ask\r\n
  \     liftIO $ logger e \"I'm going to insert in the db!\"\r\n      liftIO $ repository
  e x\r\n      return \"view\"\r\n\r\nThat's all and well, but there are two issues
  that bug me:\r\n\r\n- What if the repository function needs access to the logger,
  too? The\r\n  repository lives in the environment record, but isn't aware of it.
  That means\r\n  it can't use the `HasLogger` typeclass for easy and convenient dependency\r\n
  \ injection. Why privilege the controller in such a way?\r\n\r\n  In a sufficiently
  complex app, the diverse functions that comprise it will be\r\n  organized in a
  big\r\n  [DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) of dependencies.\r\n
  \ And it would be nice if all the functions taking part in dependency injection\r\n
  \ were treated uniformly; if all of them had access to (some view of) the\r\n  environment
  record.\r\n\r\n- We might want to write code that is innocent of `IO` and polymorphic
  over the\r\n  monad, to ensure that the program logic can't do some unexpected missile\r\n
  \ launch, or to allow testing our app in a \"pure\" way. \r\n\r\nLet's parameterize
  our environment by a monad: \r\n\r\n    type Env :: (Type -> Type) -> Type\r\n    data
  Env m = Env\r\n      { _logger :: String -> m (),\r\n        _repository :: Int
  -> m (),\r\n        _controller :: Int -> m String\r\n      }\r\n    -- helper from
  the \"rank2classes\" package\r\n    $(Rank2.TH.deriveFunctor ''Env)\r\n\r\n    instance
  HasLogger (Env m) m where\r\n      logger = _logger\r\n\r\n    instance HasRepository
  (Env m) m where\r\n      repository = _repository\r\n\r\nNotice that the controller
  function is now part of the environment. No\r\nfavorites here!\r\n\r\nThe following
  implementation of the logger function has no dependencies besides\r\n`MonadIO`:\r\n\r\n
  \   mkStdoutLogger :: MonadIO m => String -> m ()\r\n    mkStdoutLogger msg = liftIO
  (putStrLn msg)\r\n\r\nBut look at this implementation of the repository function.
  It gets hold of the\r\nlogger through `HasLogger`:\r\n\r\n    mkStdoutRepository
  :: (MonadReader e m, HasLogger e m, MonadIO m) => Int -> m ()\r\n    mkStdoutRepository
  entity = do\r\n      e <- ask\r\n      logger e \"I'm going to write the entity!\"\r\n
  \     liftIO $ print entity\r\n\r\nAnd here's the controller:\r\n\r\n    mkController
  :: (MonadReader e m, HasLogger e m, HasRepository e m) => Int -> m String\r\n    mkController
  x = do\r\n      e <- ask\r\n      logger e \"I'm going to insert in the db!\"\r\n
  \     repository e x\r\n      return \"view\"\r\n\r\nNow, lets choose `IO` as the
  base monad and assemble an environment record:\r\n\r\n    envIO :: Env (DepT Env
  IO)\r\n    envIO =\r\n      let _logger = mkStdoutLogger\r\n          _repository
  = mkStdoutRepository\r\n          _controller = mkController\r\n       in Env {_logger,
  \ _repository, _controller}\r\n\r\nNot very complicated, except... what is that
  weird `DepT Env IO` doing there in\r\nthe signature? \r\n\r\nWell, that's the whole
  reason this library exists. Trying to use a `ReaderT\r\n(Env something) IO` to parameterize
  `Env` won't fly; you'll get weird \"infinite\r\ntype\" kind of errors because the
  `Env` needs to be parameterized with the monad\r\nthat provides the `Env` environment.
  So I created the `DepT` newtype over\r\n`ReaderT` to mollify the compiler.\r\n\r\n##
  So how do we invoke the controller now?\r\n\r\nI suggest something like\r\n\r\n
  \   runDepT (do e <- ask; _controller e 7) envIO \r\n\r\n## How to embed environments
  into other environments?\r\n\r\nSometimes it might be convenient to [nest an environment
  into another\r\none](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43452644/what-is-the-difference-between-spring-parent-context-and-child-context),\r\nbasically
  making it a field of the bigger environment:\r\n\r\n    type BiggerEnv :: (Type
  -> Type) -> Type\r\n    data BiggerEnv m = BiggerEnv\r\n      { _inner :: Env m,\r\n
  \       _extra :: Int -> m Int\r\n      }\r\n    $(Rank2.TH.deriveFunctor ''BiggerEnv)\r\n\r\nWhen
  constructing the bigger environment, we have to tweak the monad parameter\r\nof
  the smaller one, to make the types match. This can be done with the\r\n`zoomEnv`
  function:\r\n\r\n    biggerEnvIO :: BiggerEnv (DepT BiggerEnv IO)\r\n    biggerEnvIO
  =\r\n      let _inner' = zoomEnv (Rank2.<$>) _inner envIO\r\n          _extra =
  pure\r\n       in BiggerEnv {_inner = _inner', _extra}\r\n\r\nWe need to pass as
  the first parameter of `zoomEnv` a function that tweaks the\r\nmonad parameter of
  `Env` using a natural transformation. We can write such a\r\nfunction ourselves,
  but here we are using the function generated for us by the\r\n[rank2classes\r\nTH](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/rank2classes-1.4.1/docs/Rank2-TH.html#v:deriveFunctor).\r\n\r\n##
  How to use \"pure fakes\" during testing?\r\n\r\nThe [test suite](./test/tests.hs)
  has an example of using a `Writer` monad for\r\ncollecting the outputs of functions
  working as [\"test\r\ndoubles\"](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html).\r\n\r\n##
  How to avoid using \"ask\" or \"asks\" before invoking a dependency?\r\n\r\nOne
  possible workaround (at the cost of more boilerplate) is to define helper\r\nfunctions
  like:  \r\n\r\n    logger' :: (MonadReader e m, HasLogger e m) => String -> m ()\r\n
  \   logger' msg = asks logger >>= \\f -> f msg\r\n\r\nWhich you can invoke like
  this:\r\n\r\n    mkController x = do\r\n      logger' \"I'm going to insert in the
  db!\"\r\n\r\nI'm not sure it's worth the hassle.\r\n\r\n## How to instrument functions
  in the environment?\r\n\r\nOnce we have commited to a concrete monad and constructed
  our\r\nrecord-of-functions, we might indulge in a bit of low-calorie\r\naspect-oriented-programming.\r\n\r\nFor
  example, imagine we want a generic way of adding logging of function\r\nparameters
  to any function in the environment, provided the environment already\r\ncontains
  a logging function.\r\n\r\nWe can write the following typeclass:\r\n\r\n    class
  Instrumentable e m r | r -> e m where\r\n      instrument ::\r\n        ( forall
  x.\r\n          HasLogger (e (DepT e m)) (DepT e m) =>\r\n          [String] ->\r\n
  \         DepT e m x ->\r\n          DepT e m x\r\n        ) ->\r\n        r ->\r\n
  \       r\r\n\r\nWhich means \"if you tell me how to transform a terminal `DepT`
  action, using\r\nthe list of preceding arguments, in an environment that has as
  logger, then\r\nI'll be able to transform any function which ends in `DepT`\".\r\n\r\nThe
  terminal case is a `DepT` without preceding parameters:\r\n\r\n    instance HasLogger
  (e (DepT e m)) (DepT e m) => Instrumentable e m (DepT e m x) where\r\n      instrument
  f d = f [] d\r\n\r\nThe recursive case handles functions argument by argument:\r\n\r\n
  \   instance (Instrumentable e m r, Show a) => Instrumentable e m (a -> r) where\r\n
  \     instrument f ar =\r\n        let instrument' = instrument @e @m @r\r\n         in
  \\a -> instrument' (\\names d -> f (show a : names) d) (ar a)\r\n\r\nHere's how
  to add logging advice to the controller function:\r\n\r\n    instrumentedEnv ::
  Env (DepT Env (Writer TestTrace))\r\n    instrumentedEnv =\r\n       let loggingAdvice
  args action = do\r\n                e <- ask\r\n                logger e $ \"advice
  before \" ++ intercalate \",\" args\r\n                r <- action\r\n                logger
  e $ \"advice after\"\r\n                pure r\r\n        in env { _controller =
  instrument loggingAdvice (_controller env) }\r\n\r\nMore complete advice support
  can be found in the\r\n[dep-t-advice](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/dep-t-advice)
  package.\r\n\r\n## Caveats\r\n\r\nThe structure of the `DepT` type might be prone
  to trigger a [known infelicity\r\nof the GHC\r\nsimplifier](https://twitter.com/DiazCarrete/status/1350116413445439493).\r\n\r\n##
  Links\r\n\r\n- This library was extracted from my answer to [this Stack Overflow\r\n
  \ question](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61782258/1364288).\r\n\r\n- The implementation
  of `mapDepT` was teased out in [this other SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65710657/writing-a-zooming-function-for-a-readert-like-monad-transformer).\r\n\r\n-
  An [SO\r\n  answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57703898/how-to-call-impure-functions-from-pure-ones/57714058#57714058)\r\n
  \ about records-of-functions and the \"veil of polymorphism\".\r\n\r\n- The answers
  to [this SO\r\n  question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61642492/simplifying-the-invocation-of-functions-stored-inside-an-readert-environment)\r\n
  \ gave me the idea for how to \"instrument\" monadic functions (although the\r\n
  \ original motive of the question was different).\r\n\r\n- I'm unsure of the relationship
  between `DepT` and the technique described in\r\n  [Adventures assembling records
  of\r\n  capabilities](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/adventures-assembling-records-of-capabilities/623).
  \r\n\r\n  It seems that, with `DepT`, functions in the environment obtain their\r\n
  \ dependencies anew every time they are invoked. If we change a function in the\r\n
  \ environment record, all other functions which depend on it will be affected\r\n
  \ in subsequent invocations. I don't think this happens with \"Adventures...\" at\r\n
  \ least when changing an already \"assembled\" record.\r\n\r\n- [RIO](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio)
  is a featureful ReaderT-like /\r\n  prelude replacement library which favors monomorphic
  environments.\r\n\r\n- Another exploration of dependency injection with `ReaderT`:\r\n
  \ [ReaderT-OpenProduct-Environment](https://github.com/keksnicoh/ReaderT-OpenProduct-Environment).\r\n\r\n-
  [registry](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/registry) is a package that\r\n  implements
  an alternative approach to dependency injection, one different\r\n  from the `ReaderT`-based
  one. \r\n\r\n"
