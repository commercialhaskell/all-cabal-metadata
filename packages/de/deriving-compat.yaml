synopsis: Backports of GHC deriving extensions
changelog: ! "### 0.5.2 [2018.09.13]\n* Fix a bug (on GHC 8.7 and above) in which
  `deriveGND`/`deriveVia` would\n  generate ill-scoped code.\n\n### 0.5.1 [2018.07.11]\n*
  Have `deriveGND`/`deriveVia` throw an error if an incorrect number of\n  arguments
  are supplied to the type class.\n\n### 0.5 [2018.07.01]\n* Backport the changes
  to `GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving` and `DerivingVia` code\n  generation from\n  [Trac
  #15290](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/15290).\n\n  As a result, code generated
  by `deriveGND` or `deriveVia` now requires the\n  `InstanceSigs` and `ScopedTypeVariables`
  language extensions. On the other\n  hand, the generated code no longer requires
  the `ImpredicativeTypes`\n  extension (unless any class methods use higher-rank
  types).\n* Allow building with `containers-0.6` and `template-haskell-2.14`.\n\n###
  0.4.3 [2018.06.16]\n* Fix a bug that caused debug-enabled GHC builds to panic when
  generating\n  code from this library (see\n  [Trac #15270](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/15270)).\n
  \ The fix only affects the library's internals, so no changes are user-facing.\n\n###
  0.4.2 [2018.05.14]\n* Backport the fixes for GHC Trac\n  [#14364](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/14364)\n
  \ and\n  [#14918](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/14918),\n  which significantly
  improve the compliation times of derived `Read`\n  instances.\n\n### 0.4.1 [2018.02.04]\n*
  Add `Data.Deriving.Via`, which allows emulating the behavior of the\n  `GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving`
  and `DerivingVia` extensions.\n* Test suite fixes for GHC 8.4.\n\n## 0.4 [2017.12.07]\n*
  Incorporate changes from the `EmptyDataDeriving` proposal (which is in GHC\n  as
  of 8.4):\n  * For derived `Eq` and `Ord` instances for empty data types, simply
  return\n    `True` and `EQ`, respectively, without inspecting the arguments.\n  *
  For derived `Read` instances for empty data types, simply return `pfail`\n    (without
  `parens`).\n  * For derived `Show` instances for empty data types, inspect the argument\n
  \   (instead of `error`ing). In addition, add `showEmptyCaseBehavior` to\n    `ShowOptions`,
  which configures whether derived instances for empty data\n    types should use
  the `EmptyCase` extension (this is disabled by default).\n  * For derived `Functor`
  and `Traversable` instances for empty data\n    types, make `fmap` and `traverse`
  strict in its argument.\n  * For derived `Foldable` instances, do not error on empty
  data types.\n    Instead, simply return the folded state (for `foldr`) or `mempty`
  (for\n    `foldMap`), without inspecting the arguments.\n  * Add `FFTOptions` (`Functor`/`Foldable`/`Traversable`
  options) to\n    `Data.Functor.Deriving`, along with variants of existing functions
  that\n    take `FFTOptions` as an argument. For now, the only configurable option
  is\n    whether derived instances for empty data types should use the `EmptyCase`\n
  \   extension (this is disabled by default).\n* Backport the fix to #13328. That
  is, when deriving `Functor` or\n  `Traversable` instances for data types where the
  last type variable is at\n  phantom role, generated `fmap`/`traverse` implementations
  now use `coerce`\n  for efficiency.\n* Rename `emptyCaseBehavior` from `Data.Functor.Deriving`
  to\n  `fftEmptyCaseBehavior`.\n\n### 0.3.6 [2017.04.10]\n* Make `deriveTraversable`
  use `liftA2` in derived implementations of\n  `traverse` when possible, now that
  `liftA2` is a class method of\n  `Applicative` (as of GHC 8.2)\n* Make `deriveShow`
  use `showCommaSpace`, a change introduced in GHC 8.2\n\n### 0.3.5 [2016.12.12]\n*
  Fix bug in which derived `Ord` instances for datatypes with many constructors\n
  \ would fail to typecheck\n\n### 0.3.4 [2016.10.20]\n* Fix bug in which infix record
  selectors weren't shown with parentheses in derived `Show` instances\n* Fix bug
  in which record selectors weren't parsed correctly in derived `Read` instances\n\n###
  0.3.3 [2016.09.11]\n* Add `Data.Bounded.Deriving`, which allows deriving `Bounded`
  with TH.\n* Add `Data.Enum.Deriving`, which allows deriving `Enum` with TH.\n* Add
  `Data.Ix.Deriving`, which allows deriving `Ix` with TH.\n* Fix bug in which derived
  `Show` instance would parenthesize the output too eagerly\n\n### 0.3.2\n* Incorporate
  a fix to GHC Trac #10858, which will be introduced in GHC 8.2\n* Fix bug in which
  derived `Ord` instances accidentally swapped their less-than(-or-equal-to) and greater-than(-or-equal-to)
  methods\n* Fix GHC HEAD build\n\n### 0.3.1\n* Allow deriving `Functor` and `Foldable`
  instances for datatypes containing unboxed tuples\n* Microoptimization in derived
  instances of higher-order versions of `Eq`, `Ord`, `Read`, and `Show`\n\n## 0.3\n*
  Added `Data.Eq.Deriving`, which allows deriving `Eq`, `Eq1`, and `Eq2` with TH.\n*
  Added `Data.Ord.Deriving`, which allows deriving `Ord`, `Ord1`, and `Ord2` with
  TH.\n* Added `Data.Read.Deriving`, which allows deriving `Read`, `Read1`, and `Eq2`
  with TH.\n* Renamed `Text.Show.Deriving.Options` to `ShowOptions` so as to disambiguate
  it from the options datatypes in other `deriving-compat` modules.\n\n### 0.2.2\n*
  Fixed a bug in `Text.Show.Deriving`'s treatment of unlifted types\n\n### 0.2.1\n*
  Added `Text.Show.Deriving`, which allows deriving `Show`, `Show1`, and `Show2` with
  TH.\n\n## 0.2\n* Added support for GHC 8.0\n* Added `Data.Functor.Deriving` and
  `Data.Traversable.Deriving`, which allow deriving `Functor` and `Traversable` with
  TH.\n* Added `Data.Deriving`, which reexports all other modules\n\n## 0.1\n* Initial
  commit\n"

  Deriving `Ord`, `Ord1`, and `Ord2`\n* Deriving `Read`, `Read1`, and `Read2`\n* Deriving

  that some recent GHC typeclasses/extensions are not covered by this package:\n\n*
  `DeriveDataTypeable`\n* `DeriveGeneric`, which was introducted in GHC 7.2 for deriving
  `Generic` instances, and modified in GHC 7.6 to allow derivation of `Generic1` instances.
  Use `Generics.Deriving.TH` from [`generic-deriving`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-deriving)
  to derive `Generic(1)` using Template Haskell.\n* `DeriveLift`, which was introduced
  in GHC 8.0 for deriving `Lift` instances. Use `Language.Haskell.TH.Lift` from [`th-lift`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/th-lift)
  to derive `Lift` using Template Haskell.\n* The `Bifunctor` typeclass, which was
  introduced in GHC 7.10, as well as the `Bifoldable` and `Bitraversable` typeclasses,
  which were introduced in GHC 8.2. Use `Data.Bifunctor.TH` from [`bifunctors`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bifunctors)
  to derive these typeclasses using Template Haskell.\n"
