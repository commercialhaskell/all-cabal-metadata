description: "# derive-prim: Derive Prim and PrimUnaligned using Generic\n## USAGE\nHere
  is an example of how to derive the Prim and PrimUnaligned instance.\n```\n{-# LANGUAGE
  DerivingVia #-}\nimport Data.Primitive\nimport Data.Primitive.Generic\nimport Data.Primitive.ByteArray.Unaligned\n\ndata
  Struct = Struct\n  { membChar  :: Char    \n  , membInt   :: Int\n  , membFloat
  :: Float\n  } derive (Generic)\n    derive (Prim, PrimUnaligned) via (GenericPrim
  Struct)\n```\nAll members must implement both an instance of Prim and an instance
  of PrimUnaligned. Nested structs are also allowed as long as they implement the
  nessisary instances.\n```\ndata Inside = ... \n  derive (Generic) \n  derive (Prim,
  PrimUnaligned) via (GenericPrim Struct)\n\ndata Outside = Outside \n  { ...\n  ,
  nested :: Inside\n    ...\n  } derive (Generic) derive (Prim, PrimUnaligned) via
  (GenericPrim Struct)\n```\nTo tweak members placement in memory use `Align` or `Packed`.\n```\ndata
  Struct = Struct \n  { ...\n  , someField :: Align 4 SomeType {- This field will
  have an alignment of 4 bytes -}\n    ...\n  , someOtherField :: Packed SomeOtherType
  {- This field will have an alignment of 1 bytes #-}\n  }\n```\n## Details\nMembers
  are layout in memory according to their order. Members placed higher will have a
  lower memory address. \nEach member's offset will be the lowest offset respecting
  its alignment such that no overlapping between previous members occur.\nThe alignment
  of the structure is the least common multiple of all its members' alignments.\nThe
  size of the structures is rounded up to the nearest multiple of the structure's
  alignment.\n\nCurrently, only data types with one constructor are supported.\n"
