description: |-
  Deriving type class instances for monad transformer stacks can be tedious.
  By actually composing transformers with `ComposeT` we don't need to implement
  each type class for each transformer.
  Instead we need a single instance for `Elevator`, which will then help us pick
  the correct instance with DerivingVia.
