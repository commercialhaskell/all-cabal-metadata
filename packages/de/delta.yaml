description: |-
  Delta is a library for detecting file changes in any given
  directory. The package is written using the sodium FRP library
  but it also provides a callback based API.

  File changes on OS X are based on the @FSEvents@ API that is also
  used by TimeMachine. On other operating systems the library
  currently uses recursive descents in directories. I will include
  @inotify@ for Linux. If someone would like to have a non-polling
  based API for windows or BSD, I would really like it if anyone
  would contribute.

  The project also contains an executable, delta-run, which
  allows you to run arbitrary shell commands when a file in a
  directory (recursively) changes.

  @
  $> delta-run --help
  Usage: delta-run [-i|--interval INTERVAL] [-v|--verbose] FILE CMD
  Available options:
  -h,--help                Show this help text
  -i,--interval INTERVAL   Run at most every n seconds
  -v,--verbose             Print extra output
  FILE                     The directory that is watched
  CMD                      The command to run
  @

  For example you could use @delta-run@ to rebuild your project
  everytime the source changes like this:

  @
  delta-run ./src \"cabal build\"
