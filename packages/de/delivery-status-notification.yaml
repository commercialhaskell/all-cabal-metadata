description: |-
  delivery-status-notification seeks to aid in understanding bounce e-mails. The
  library will be guided by RFC3464 and RFC3463 (and any other relevant RFCs I
  find), but in practice will prioritise being useful over being correct, since
  DSNs in practice seem to have a reputation for being inconsistent.
