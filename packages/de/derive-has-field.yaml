  Derive HasField instances
  ===

  The [`OverloadedRecordDot`][overloaded-record-dot] syntax is surprisingly nice.
  I really enjoy writing code with this extension and I was originally hesistant.

  [Persistent][persistent] has a really nice feature where it will automatically remove
  prefixes from models. Given a model like,

  ```
  BankAccount
    accountNumber String
  ```

  You would normally reference this field as `bankAccountAccountNumber`. However,
  with overloaded record dot you can write `bankAccount.accountNumber` which is
  much nicer.

  At work, I really wanted this for **every** record. With this library, I can
  write,

  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}

  import DeriveHasField

  data BankAccount =
    BankAccount
      { bankAccountAccountNumber :: String
      }

  deriveHasFieldWith (dropPrefix "bankAccount") ''BankAccount
  ```
