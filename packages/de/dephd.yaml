description: "  Synopsis\n  --------\n\ndephd - A simple tool for base calling and
  quality appraisal\n\nReads files in phd-format (phred output), either specified
  individually,\nor in a directory (use the --dir option to read directories).\n\n
  \ Installation\n  ------------\n\nYou need the GHC compiler, or if you know what
  you are doing, another\nHaskell compiler or interpreter with Cabal.  You also need
  to install\nthe 'bio' library (darcs get http://malde.org/~ketil/bio)\n\nWith those
  things in place, you should be able to do\n\n     runhaskell Setup configure\n     runhaskell
  Setup build\n     sudo runhaskell Setup install\n\nOptionally, add \"--prefix $HOME\"
  (without the quotes) after configure\nto install to your home directory - in which
  case you don't need the 'sudo'.\n\n\n  Usage\n  -----\n\nA brief usage report is
  printed if you run 'dephd -h'.  Somewhat more detailed:\n\nInput is specified either
  as a list of phd-files (typcially generated\nby Phred), a list of directories containing
  phd-files (using the\n--input-dirs) option, a file containing a list of names of
  phd-files\n(--input-list), or a Fasta and associated quality file (-i foo.fasta\nfoo.qual).
  \n\nOutput is specified by -J, -X, -P, -R foo.ranks, -F foo.fasta, and/or\n-Q foo.qual.
  \ The first three generate a plot of sequence quality in\nJPEG files, an X window,
  or Postscript files, respectively.  If you\nuse -X on multiple files, hit q to terminate
  one window and go to the\nnext.\n\nThree other options (-R, -F, and -Q) output different
  aspects\nof the sequence information to files (specify '-' for printing to\nstandard
  output instead - obviously this will be messy if you do it\nfor more than one option!).
  \ -F and -Q is for generating the standard\nFasta and Quality files, while -R produces
  a file with one line per\nsequence containing various quality measures, including
  a verdict\nranging from Excellent, through Good and Poor, to Junk.\n\nFinally, -E
  can be used to generate a file suitable for submission to\ndbEST.  Usually, you
  need to provide a library table (-l option), that is,\na text file with whitespace-seprated
  columns describing each library.\nThe first line of the table contains columns labels,
  and these should\ncorrespond to fields in the dbEST library record format. One column\nshould
  be labelled \"Pattern\" and contain a regular expression matching\nsequence names
  from this library.\n\nFiltering can be specified with the -t option, which interprets\ntrimming
  information from Phred or Lucy, and chops off the offending\nparts, or with the
  -q options, which masks poor quality parts of\nsequences to lower case, and really
  poor quality parts to 'n'\ncharacters. \n\n  Bugs\n  ----\n\nNot many, I hope.  The
  program should work in (approximately) constant\nspace, and be able to deal with
  large amounts of sequences.\n\nFor further questions, email me at <ketil@malde.org>\n"
