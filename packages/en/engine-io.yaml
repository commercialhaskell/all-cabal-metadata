synopsis: A Haskell implementation of Engine.IO
changelog: ! "## 1.2.22 -- 2018-09-30\n\n### Other Changes\n\n* Increased the upper-bound
  of `base` to < 4.13.\n* Increased the upper-bound of `stm` to < 2.6.\n\n## 1.2.21
  -- 2018-08-12\n\n### Other Changes\n\n* Increased the upper-bound of `aeson` to
  < 1.5.\n* Increased the upper-bound of `base` to < 4.12.\n* Increased the upper-bound
  of `errors` to < 2.4.\n* Increased the upper-bound of `free` to < 5.2.\n* Increased
  the upper-bound of `mwc-random` to < 0.15.\n\n## 1.2.20\n\n### Other Changes\n\n*
  Increased the upper-bound of `aeson` to < 1.4.\n* Increased the upper-bound of `async`
  to < 2.3.\n* Increased the upper-bound of `free` to < 5.1.\n\n## 1.2.19\n\n### Other
  Changes\n\n* Increased the lower-bound of `websockets` to 0.11.\n\n## 1.2.18\n\n###
  Other Changes\n\n* Switch from `either` to `errors`.\n\n## 1.2.17\n\n### Other Changes\n\n*
  Increased the upper-bound of `aeson` to < 1.3.\n* Increased the upper-bound of `websockets`
  to < 0.13.\n\n## 1.2.16\n\n### Other Changes\n\n* Increased the upper-bound of `aeson`
  to < 1.2.\n\n## 1.2.15\n\n* Increased the upper-bound of `aeson`, `vector` and `websockets`.\n\n##
  1.2.14\n\n* Increased the upper-bound of `base` and `transformers`.\n\n## 1.2.13\n\n*
  Increased the upper-bound of `aeson` to allow < 0.12.\n\n## 1.2.12\n\n* Increased
  the upper-bound of `async` to allow < 2.2.\n\n## 1.2.11\n\n* Increased the upper-bound
  of aeson to allow < 0.11.\n\n## 1.2.10\n\n* Increase upper-bound of `vector` to
  < 0.12.\n\n## 1.2.9\n\n* Same changes as 1.2.8, but the 1.2.8 release was formed
  incorrectly and didn't\n  compile.\n\n## 1.2.8\n\n* Fixed a bug in the heartbeat
  monitor. The heartbeat thread exists to ensure\n  that all connections are still
  active, so we can detect when a long-polling\n  connection is closed. However, older
  versions of `engine-io`, the timer would\n  be reset whenever *we* sent the client
  a message, rather than only when we\n  *received* a message from the client. This
  meant that for high-traffic\n  applications, old connections might never be removed,
  resulting in a memory\n  leak.\n\n## 1.2.7\n\n* Support decoding payloads coming
  through XHR polling transport.\n  Previously, this scenario would lead to HTTP 400
  responses.\n* Increased upper bound on `either` to < 4.5.\n\n## 1.2.6\n\n* Increased
  upper-bounds of aeson to < 0.10 and of attoparsec to < 0.14.\n\n## 1.2.5\n\n* Increased
  the upper-bound of base to allow < 4.9. Now builds on\n  GHC 7.10.1.\n\n## 1.2.4\n\n*
  Add a 100ms delay in the WebSocket upgrade process. This matches the\n  behavior
  of the reference engine.io implementation (in NodeJS), and\n  avoids a race condition
  on slower machines. Without this, it was\n  possible for the client to experience
  a up-to-45s delay before\n  upgrading.\n\n## 1.2.3\n\n* Revert double-encoding introduced
  in 1.0.1. This now requires that you\n  use a modern version of the `socket.io`
  client library. This work was\n  tested against `socket.io-1.2.1.js`.\n\n## 1.2.2\n\n*
  We now use `stm-delay` to implement a timeout, if we don't *receive*\n  network
  traffic from the client. Under normal operation, the Socket.io\n  client should
  ping the server, so an idle session should remain alive.\n\n## 1.2.1\n\n* Fixed
  a potential race condition in session allocation, where we could\n  clobber existing
  session ids.\n\n## 1.2.0\n\n* `ServerAPI`'s `srvParseParseRequestBody` has changed
  its return type to\n  `Either String a`. This allows API providers to catch exceptions
  that may\n  happen when attempting to perform this parse.\n\n## 1.1.2\n\n* 1.1.1
  accidently removed `websockets` from the list of available upgrades.\n  This release
  reverts that change.\n\n## 1.1.1\n\n* Long-polling connections now emit a `ping`
  message after 45 seconds, if no\n  data is written to them.\n\n* There is a new
  `dupRawReader` function, which lets you create a read-only\n  stream of raw communication
  with a socket.\n\n## 1.1.0\n\n* The `ServerAPI` functions `srvWriteBuilder`, `srvSetContentType`
  and\n  `srvSetResponseCode` have been merged into a single function:\n  `srvTerminateWithResponse`.
  This should allow `ServerAPI` to be provided for\n  Yesod.\n\n  Thanks to Tim Baumann
  (@timjb) for this change.\n\n## 1.0.2\n\n* The `ping` thread spawned by `websockets`
  is now disabled, as it has been\n  observed that these pings are using invalid sockets.
  Specifically, see\n  https://github.com/lpsmith/postgresql-simple/issues/117.\n\n##
  1.0.1\n\n* Purposefully double-encode websocket traffic. Unfortunately this is necessary\n
  \ due to https://github.com/Automattic/engine.io-client/issues/322. When a new\n
  \ version of `engine.io` is released upstream, I will revert this.\n\n## 1.0.0\n\n*
