  0.5
  ===

    * Added `char`.

    * Fixed masking parse errors with default values. (https://github.com/supki/envparse/issues/8)

    * Replaced `keep` with `sensitive`. All variables are kept in the environment after a successul parse
      except those wrapped in `sensitive`. (https://github.com/supki/envparse/issues/9)

  0.4.1
  =====

    * Supported GHC 8.4.3.


  0.4
  ===

    * Supported GHC 8.0.1.

    * On GHC 7.8 and newer, as a secutiry measure, all declared variables are unset by the end of
      a successful parse.  If you want to keep the variable in the environment, use the `keep` modifier.
      (https://github.com/supki/envparse/pull/7)

  0.3.4
  =====

    * Added `splitOn`.

  0.3.3
  =====

    * Removed the unnecessary `AsEmpty` and `AsUnset` constraints on the error type
      in the `flag` and `switch` parsers.

  0.3.2
  =====

    * Added `showDef`.

  0.3.1
  =====

    * Supported `Generic`ally derived `Parser`s on GHC 7.10.

  0.3.0
  =====

    * Supported user-defined `Reader` errors. (https://github.com/supki/envparse/pull/4)

    * Widened the range of GHC versions to test the library with from 7.6–7.8 to 7.6–HEAD.

  0.2.2
  =====

    * Added `helpDoc`, a `Parser` pretty-printer for use in error messages.

  0.2.1
  =====

    * Cosmetic changes in the help output.

  [optparse-applicative][0], but for environment variables

  See `example/Main.hs` for an executable example

  As to why anyone would want to use environment to configure their applications, here's [what some folks think][1] about it.
