description: |-
  A library providing tools for building enumeration procedures for recursively-
  enumerable datatypes.  This is built atop the arith-encode library, and makes
  use of the natural number isomorphisms it provides to represent individual
  decisions in the enumeration procedure.  As such, each enumeration result is
  denoted by a unique path, consisting of a sequence of natural numbers.  An
  enumeration procedure is simply a (partial) mapping between sequences
  and a given datatype.

  The library provides functionality for constructing enumeration procedures,
  as well as facilities for performing enumeration according to various search
  strategies (depth-first, breadth-first, etc).  These procedures can also be
  "warm-started" using a path or a set of paths.  Obvious applications include
  exhaustive search, testing, automated proving, and others.

  Additionally, as a path is simply a sequence of natural numbers, an
  enumeration procedure can double as a binary serializer/deserializer.  For
  well-behaved enumeration procedures (ie. those where the mapping is an
  isomorphism), the resulting binary format should be very nearly succinct.
