changelog: |
  Changes from 0.8.5 to 0.8.6

  * Fixed arithmetic underflow during GHC >=8.8 build.
  * Added support GHC 9.0.

  Changes from 0.8.4 to 0.8.5
  ---------------------------

  * Fixed sdist for both v1 and v2 approaches.
  * Fixed build package as dependency via `v2` commands.

  Changes from 0.8.3 to 0.8.4
  ---------------------------

  * Fixed builds with GHC 8.2, 8.4
  * Adopted to upgraded Hackage (Cabal 3.0)

  Changes from 0.8.2 to 0.8.3
  ---------------------------

  * Added support Cabal 2.0

  Changes from 0.8 to 0.8.2
  -------------------------

  * Deprecated support for very old GHCs
  * Updated cabal file to differentiate between build dependencies and setup dependencies
  * Add upper and lower bounds to build dependencies
  * Stack compatibility

  Changes from 0.8 to 0.8.1
  -------------------------

  * Added the ShiftJIS and CP932 encodings

  Changes from 0.7.0.2 to 0.8
  ---------------------------

  * GHC-7.10/AMP compatibility

  Changes from 0.7.0.1 to 0.7.0.2
  -------------------------------

  * Flesh out the MacOSRoman encoding, which was missing 33 code points

  Changes from 0.7 to 0.7.0.1
  ---------------------------

  * GHC-7.8 compatibility

  Changes from 0.6.7 to 0.7
  -------------------------

  * the type of ByteSource's fetchAhead method changed to accomodate updates to the binary package

  Changes from 0.6.5 to 0.6.7
  ---------------------------

  * Skipped version 0.6.6 due to rogue upload on Hackage
  * GHC-7 and HaXml-1.22 compatibility
  * add -systemEncoding flag for Windows builds

  Changes from 0.6.4 to 0.6.5
  ---------------------------

  * Make package work with >=base-4.3.0.0 and mtl-2

  Changes from 0.6.3 to 0.6.4
  ---------------------------

  * Throw an error when encoding non-ascii chars with ascii
  * Fix compilation with mtl-2

  Changes from 0.6.2 to 0.6.3
  ---------------------------

  * Use new QuickCheck version 2 for tests
  * Fixed UTF16 encoding range

  Changes from 0.6.0 to 0.6.1
  ---------------------------

  * Support for many MSDOS codepages
  * Show instance for DynEncoding
  * More IO functions
  * Fancy translation tables for the documentation of auto-generated modules

  Changes from 0.5.2 to 0.6.0
  ---------------------------

  * Moved from TemplateHaskell to a custom pre-processor for code-generation.
    This is necessary because:
    - TemplateHaskell is really slow for large data structures
    - TemplateHaskell doesn't yet support the MagicHash extension that is useful for the library
  * Use efficient, static data structures for encoding/decoding
  * Fixed bug in UTF-8 that could call 'chr' with bad arguments

  Changes from 0.5 to 0.5.2
  -------------------------

  * Export function encodingFromStringExplicit

  Changes from 0.4 to 0.5
  -----------------------

  * Complete rewrite of the Encoding class to allow for
    - On-the-fly changing of the encoding while en-/decoding
    - Ability to en-/decode from/to any data structure
  * A general module to help specify encodings based on ISO 2022
  * New encodings:
    - JIS X 0201
    - JIS X 0208
    - ISO 2022-JP
  * More test cases

  Changes from 0.3 to 0.4
  -----------------------

  * A new, strict UTF-8 decoder
  * Minor bugs fixed in UTF-16 and BootString
  * Test cases for UTF-8, UTF-16 and BootString
  * Added KOI8U encoding

  Changes from 0.2 to 0.3
  -----------------------

  * Converted to new cabal interface
  * Support for GHC 6.8
  * Support for new bytestring interface

  Changes from 0.1 to 0.2
  -----------------------

  * Implemented GB18030 encoding

description: Haskell has excellect handling of unicode, the Char type covers all unicode
  chars. Unfortunately, there's no possibility to read or write something to the outer
  world in an encoding other than ascii due to the lack of support for encodings.
  This library should help with that.
