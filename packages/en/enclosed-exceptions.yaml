description: "enclosed-exceptions\n===================\n\nThe purpose of this module
  is to allow you to capture all exceptions originating from within the enclosed computation,\nwhile
  still reacting to asynchronous exceptions aimed at the calling thread.\n\nThis way,
  you can be sure that the function that calls, for example,  ```catchAny```,\nwill
  still respond to ```ThreadKilled``` or ```Timeout``` events raised by another thread
  \n(with ``throwTo``), while capturing all exceptions, synchronous or asynchronous,\nresulting
  from the execution of the enclosed computation.\n\nOne particular use case is to
  allow the safe execution of code from various\nlibraries (which you do not control),
  capturing any faults that might occur,\nwhile remaining responsive to higher level
  events and control actions.\n\nThis library was originally developed by [Michael
  Snoyman](http://www.snoyman.com/) for the\n[ClassyPrelude](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/classy-prelude)
  library,\nand was latter spun-off into a separate independent package.\n\nFor a
  more detailed explanation of the motivation behind this functions, see:\n\n[Catching
  all exceptions](https://www.fpcomplete.com/user/snoyberg/general-haskell/exceptions/catching-all-exceptions)\n\nand
  \n \n[the discussion in haskell-cafe](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/haskell-cafe/e9H2I-3uVJE)\n"
