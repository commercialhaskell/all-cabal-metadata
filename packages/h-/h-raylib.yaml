  ![Hackage Version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/h-raylib)\n\n\nThis library
  includes Haskell bindings to the [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) library.\n\n[Basic
  usage](#basic-usage) | [Platform specific requirements](#platform-specific-requirements)
  | [Advanced usage](#advanced-usage) | [GHCi](#running-in-ghci) | [Documentation](#documentation)
  | [FAQ and help](#faq-and-help)\n\n## Basic usage\n\nTo use this package, include
  it as a dependency in your cabal file.\n\n```cabal\nbuild-depends:\n  base,\n  #
  ...\n  h-raylib\n```\n\nIt should work out of the box. See [Advanced usage](#advanced-usage)
  for more complex use cases.\n\n## Platform specific requirements\n\nThis library
  is known to work on Windows, Linux, and Mac. It may not work properly on other platforms,
  so don't hesitate to report issues on the GitHub repository.\n\n### Windows/Mac\n\nh-raylib
  should automatically work if you do not disable the `detect-platform` flag. In that
  case, you may skip this step.\n\n**If you do disable the `detect-platform` flag
  when building,** use the `platform-windows` or `platform-mac` flag when building.\n\n###
  Linux\n\nYou may need to run the following to install [X11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System)
  (a window manager for Linux).\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxrandr-dev
  libxi-dev libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev\n```\n\nNow, h-raylib should automatically
  work if you do not disable the `detect-platform` flag. In that case, you may skip
  the following.\n\n**If you do disable the `detect-platform` flag when building,**
  use the `platform-linux` flag when building\n\n### BSD *(Experimental)*\n\nh-raylib
  should automatically work if you do not disable the `detect-platform` flag. In that
  case, you may skip this step.\n\n**If you do disable the `detect-platform` flag
  when building,** use the `platform-bsd` flag when building.\n\n### Other platforms\n\nThis
  library has not yet been tested on other platforms (raylib supports\nAndroid, Raspberry
  Pi, and DRM, all of which have not been implemented in\nh-raylib). Anybody willing
  to try is welcome.\n\nWeb support has not been finalized yet.\n\nIf you get it working
  on other platforms, please create a pull request in the\nGitHub repository and update
  `h-raylib.cabal` with the relevant config.\n\n### Advanced usage\n\nYour platform-specific
  dependencies will automatically be built by default. You\nmay want to disable this
  behavior. You can disable the `detect-platform` flag to\nachieve this.\n\nYou can
  do this through the command line when running your project, like so\n\n```sh\ncabal
  run --constraint=\"h-raylib -detect-platform\"\n```\n\nOr you can add it to your
  `cabal.project` file.\n\n```\npackage h-raylib\n  flags: -detect-platform\n```\n\nThe
  flags `platform-windows`, `platform-mac`, `platform-linux`, and `platform-bsd` are
  also\nsupported if you want to build for a different platform.\n\n## Running in
  GHCi\n\nYou can use this library in GHCi just like any other library, but you will
  need to add `--constraint=\"h-raylib +ghci\"` to the command. For example, in the
  root folder of this repository, you could use the command below to use the library
  through GHCi.\n\n```\ncabal repl --constraint=\"h-raylib +ghci\"\n```\n\nYou may
  need to use `:set -fno-ghci-sandbox` after entering the REPL to fix problems with
  multithreaded execution.\n\nOn Windows, you may lose joystick support when running
  in GHCi.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor documentation: [DOCUMENTATION.md](https://github.com/Anut-py/h-raylib/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md).\n\nFor
  contributors: [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Anut-py/h-raylib/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nIf
  you want to request a feature, create an issue in the GitHub repo. Please check
  [the roadmap](https://github.com/Anut-py/h-raylib/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#h-raylib-roadmap)
  to see if the feature has already been planned.\n\n## FAQ and help\n\n- When I try
  to run an h-raylib program I get the error `The code execution cannot proceed because
  libwinpthread-1.dll was not found. Reinstalling the program may fix this problem.`\n
  \ - See [#14](https://github.com/Anut-py/h-raylib/issues/14)\n \n- When I try to
  compile an h-raylib program I get the error `Missing (or bad) C libraries: gcc_eh`\n
  \ - See [#36](https://github.com/Anut-py/h-raylib/issues/36)\n\nIf you find a bug,
  please [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Anut-py/h-raylib/issues).\n\nIf
  you have a question about the library that is not related to a bug, ask it on [GitHub
  discussions](https://github.com/Anut-py/h-raylib/discussions) or in the [Haskell
  GameDev Discord server](https://discord.gg/aKHNgxc59t).\n\n## License\n\nThis project
