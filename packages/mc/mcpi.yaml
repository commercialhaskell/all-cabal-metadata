changelog: "Version 0.0.1.2\n===============\n\nUpdated pipes upper bound (thanks
  to Gabriel Gonzalez).\n\nVersion 0.0.1.1\n===============\n\nRenamed the change
  log from CHANGES.md to CHANGELOG so\nthat Hackage will display it.\n\nMinor HLint
  changes (no change in behavior or API).\n\nVersion 0.0.1.0\n===============\n\nUpdated
  to use pipes version 4; there is no change in the\nlibrary API (pipes is only used
  by the hmcpi executable).\n\nVersion 0.0.0.4\n===============\n\nAn initial attempt
  at handling invalid commands has been added by\nflushing the connection buffer each
  time a command or query is sent.\n\nQueries now raise an `IOError` if they return
  the message `Fail` (it\ncould also be due to the previous command failing if the
  buffer\nflush mentioned above did not catch the error).\n\nAdded the debugmcpi example.
  This is now built, along with hmcpi,\nby setting the build-debug configure option
  (which is turned off\nby default).\n\nVersion 0.0.0.3\n===============\n\nThe examples
  - apart from `hmcpi` - now accept the `--debug` command-line\noption which causes
  the messages sent to, and received from, MineCraft\nto be printed to the standard-error
  channel. The format of these \nmessages has been changed slightly.\n\nVersion 0.0.0.2\n===============\n\nMinor
  document improvements. Added examples/XJump.hs, which is the\nexample used in the
  documentation for Network.MineCraft.Pi.Client.\n\nVersion 0.0.0.1\n===============\n\nInitial
  version.\n"

description: |-
  The MineCraft edition for Raspberry PI comes with a Java and
  Python API. See "Network.MineCraft.Pi.Client" for a basic
  example.

  This is a *very* basic, and *incomplete* Haskell version. I
  fully expect everything to change in later versions.

  A number of very simple examples are included in the examples/ directory,
  as well as a program that lets you interact with MineCraft directly.

  Please see the TODO.md file in the source code for an incomplete
  list of possible changes, and the CHANGELOG file for changes
  in the module.
