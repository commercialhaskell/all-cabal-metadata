description: |-
  This library allows an application to extend the 'global state'
  hidden inside the IO monad with semi-arbitrary data. Data is
  required to be 'Typeable'. The library provides an essentially
  unbounded number of key-value stores indexed by strings, with
  each key within the stores also being a string.
