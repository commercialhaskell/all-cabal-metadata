  To build the library type

      runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
      runhaskell Setup.lhs build
      runhaskell Setup.lhs haddock    # optional
      runhaskell Setup.lhs install

  There are a few tests and examples in the src directory.

  TODOs:
  -----

  It may be possible (and worthwhile) to write a more general region monad that
  is not tied to IO. I've had a brief look into this but right now I can't find
  a clean and consistent way to abstract mutable references for different
  monads.

  It would also be nice to provide all the functions found in System.IO ideally
  in such a way so the functions can be used with either Strings, ByteStrings or
  something else.
  I can't think of a clean way to do this either. Any suggestions would be
  welcome.
