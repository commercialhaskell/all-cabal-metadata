description: |-
  Ion is a Haskell EDSL for concurrent, realtime, embedded programming.
  It interfaces with the Ivory EDSL, <http://ivorylang.org/>, to perform
  code generation.  It supports similar scheduling functionality to Atom
  (<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/atom>), and also accomodates
  asynchronous programming with continuation-passing style.
  Be forewarned that Ion is still heavily experimental.  For some
  further explanation, see the write-up at HaskellEmbedded,
  <https://haskellembedded.github.io/posts/2016-09-23-introducing-ion.html>.
