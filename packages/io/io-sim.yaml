  # Revsion history of io-sim

  ## 1.2.0.0

  ### Breaking changes

  * `selectTraceEvents`, `selectTraceEvents'` catpure time of events.
  * Added select function which capture the time of the trace events:
    - `selectTraceEventsDynamicWithTime`
    - `selectTraceEventsDynamicWithTime'`
    - `selectTraceEventsSayWithTime`
    - `selectTraceEventsSayWithTime'`

  ### Non breaking changes

  * Provide `MonadInspectMVar` instance for `IOSim`.
  - Added NFData & NoThunks instances for `ThreadId`

  ## 1.1.0.0

  ### Non breaking changes

  * `io-classes-1.1.0.0`

  ## 1.0.0.1

  ### Non breaking changes

  * Support `ghc-9.6`.

  ## 1.0.0.0

  ### Breaking changes

  * Support refactored `MonadTimer`, and new `MonadTimerFancy`, `MonadTimeNSec`
    monad classes.

  ## 0.6.0.0

  ### Breaking changes

  # IOSim - IO Simulator Monad

  A pure simulator monad built on top of the lazy `ST` monad which supports:

    * optional dynamic race discovery and schedule exploration
    * synchronous and asynchronous exceptions; including: throwing, catching and
      masking synchronous and asynchronous exceptions;
    * concurrency (using simulated threads), with interfaces shaped by the
      `base` and `async` libraries;
    * software transactional memory (`STM`);
    * simulated time;
    * timeouts;
    * dynamically typed traces and event log tracing;
    * lifting any `ST` computations;
    * inspection of `STM` mutable data structures;
    * deadlock detection;
    * `MonadFix` instances for both `IOSim` and its corresponding `STM` monad.

  `io-sim` together with [`io-classes`] is a drop-in replacement for the `IO`
  monad (with some ramifications).  It was designed to write easily testable
  Haskell code (including simulating socket programming or disk IO).  Using
  [`io-classes`] and [`si-timers`] libraries one can write code that can run in
  both: the real `IO` and the `IOSim` monad provided by this package.  One of the
  design goals was to keep the API as close as possible to `base`, `exceptions`,
  `async`, and `stm` packages.

  `io-sim` package also provides two interpreters, a standard one and `IOSimPOR`
  which supports dynamic discovery or race conditions and schedule exploration
  with partial order reduction.

  `io-sim` provides API to explore traces produced by a simulation.  It can
  contain arbitrary Haskell terms, a feature that is very useful to build
  property-based tests using `QuickCheck`.

  The package contains thorough tests, including tests of `STM` against the
  original specification (as described in [Composable Memory
  Transactions](https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/stm/stm.pdf)
  and its `GHC` implementation.  This can be seen in both ways: as a check that
  our implementation matches the specification and the `GHC` implementation, but
  also the other way around: that `GHC`s `STM` implementation meets the
  specification.
