  # Revsion history of io-sim

  ## next release

  ### Breaking changes

  ### Non-breaking changes

  ## 1.3.1.0

  ### Non-breaking changes

  * Optimised `io-sim` performance (improved memory footprint).
  * Fixed a bug in `io-sim-por`: `execAtomically'` should not commit tvars.

  ## 1.3.0.0

  ### Breaking changes

  * `MainReturn`, `MainException` and the pattern synonyms `TraceMainReturn`,
    `TraceMainException` changed their signature.  They will now also show the main thread id.
  * Renamed `ThreadId` to `IOSimThreadId` to avoid a clash with `ThreadId`
    associated type family of `MonadFork`.  It makes it much simpler to paste
    failing `ScheduleControl` in `ghci` or tests.
  * `BlockedReason` was modified: `BlockedOnOther` was removed, in favour of `BlockedOnDelay` and `BlockOnThrowTo`.
  * The `Failure` type (for example returned by `runSim`) now also contains
    a constructor for internal failures.  This improved error reporting when
    there's a bug in `IOSimPOR`.  Currently it's only used by some of the
    assertions in `IOSimPOR`.

  #### Non-breaking changes

  * Refactored the internal API to avoid `unsafePerformIO`.
  * Fixed bugs which lead to discovery of schedules which are impossible to run.
  * Added haddocks, refactored the code base to improve readability.
  * Fixed reported `step` in `EventTxWakup`
  * Added debugging information schedule, (`explorationDebugLevel` option).
    Mostly useful for debugging `IOSimPOR` itself.  This information will
    contains `Effect`, discovered races and schedules.
  * Addded or improved pretty printers for `SimTrace`.  Among other changes,
    a racy `StepId`: `(RacyThreadId [1,2], 2)`, is now pretty printed as `Thread
    {1,2}.2`, a non racy step is printed as `Thread [1,2].2`.
  * Fixed trace of calls to the `deschedule` function.
  * Exposed `Timeout` type as part of the `newTimeout` API.
  * When `explorationDebugLevel` is set, avoid printing the same trace twice.
  * Reimplemented `labelTVarIO` and `traceTVarIO` in `ST` monad, which simplifies
    trace of these calls.
  * Fixed `traceTVar` for `TVar`'s created with `registerDelay`.
  * Added pretty printer for `SimResult`, and other pretty printer improvements.
  * Support `ghc-9.8`.

  ## 1.2.0.0

  ### Breaking changes

  * `selectTraceEvents`, `selectTraceEvents'` catpure time of events.
  * Added select function which capture the time of the trace events:
    - `selectTraceEventsDynamicWithTime`
    - `selectTraceEventsDynamicWithTime'`
    - `selectTraceEventsSayWithTime`
    - `selectTraceEventsSayWithTime'`

  ### Non-breaking changes

  * Provide `MonadInspectMVar` instance for `IOSim`.
  - Added NFData & NoThunks instances for `ThreadId`

  ## 1.1.0.0

  ### Non-breaking changes

  * `io-classes-1.1.0.0`

  ## 1.0.0.1

  ### Non-breaking changes

  * Support `ghc-9.6`.

  ## 1.0.0.0

  ### Breaking changes

  * Support refactored `MonadTimer`, and new `MonadTimerFancy`, `MonadTimeNSec`
    monad classes.

  ## 0.6.0.0

  ### Breaking changes

  * Added `TimeoutId` to `EventThreadDelay` and `EventThreadFired` events.

  ### Non-breaking changes

  * Fixed `threadDelay` in presence of asynchronous exceptions (in `IOSim` and `IOSimPOR`) (#80).
  * Fixed bug in `IOSim` & `IOSimPOR` which resulted in reusing existing
    `ThreadId`s (#80).

  ## 0.5.0.0

  * `MVar` type family is not injective anymore.
  * Removed default implementation of `readMVar` in the `MonadMVar` type class.
  * Moved `MVarDefault` to `io-sim` package.

  ## 0.4.0.0

  * support `ghc-9.4` (except on Windows input-output-hk/io-sim#51)
  * `MonadCatch` instance for `STM (IOSim s)` monad
  * fixed `isEmptyTBQueeuDefault` (thanks to @EMQ-YangM)
  * refactored internal implementation of timeouts, changed `SimEventType`
    constructors

  ## 0.3.0.0

  * added `Functor` instance for `SimResult`
  * added `MonadFix` instance for `STM (IOSim s)`
  * support `ghc-9.2` & `ghc-9.4`

  ## 0.2.0.0

  * First version published on Hackage.
  * Depends on `io-classes-0.2.0.0`.

  ## 0.1.0.0

  * Initial version, not released on Hackage.

  # IOSim - IO Simulator Monad

  A pure simulator monad built on top of the lazy `ST` monad which supports:

    * optional dynamic race discovery and schedule exploration
    * synchronous and asynchronous exceptions; including: throwing, catching and
      masking synchronous and asynchronous exceptions;
    * concurrency (using simulated threads), with interfaces shaped by the
      `base` and `async` libraries;
    * software transactional memory (`STM`);
    * simulated time;
    * timeouts;
    * dynamically typed traces and event log tracing;
    * lifting any `ST` computations;
    * inspection of `STM` mutable data structures;
    * deadlock detection;
    * `MonadFix` instances for both `IOSim` and its corresponding `STM` monad.
    * partial order reduction (see [IOSimPOR]).

  `io-sim` together with [`io-classes`] is a drop-in replacement for the `IO`
  monad (with some ramifications).  It was designed to write easily testable
  Haskell code (including simulating socket programming or disk IO).  Using
  [`io-classes`] and [`si-timers`] libraries one can write code that can run in
  both: the real `IO` and the `IOSim` monad provided by this package.  One of the
  design goals was to keep the API as close as possible to `base`, `exceptions`,
  `async`, and `stm` packages.

  `io-sim` package also provides two interpreters, a standard one and `IOSimPOR`
  which supports dynamic discovery or race conditions and schedule exploration
  with partial order reduction.

  `io-sim` provides API to explore traces produced by a simulation.  It can
  contain arbitrary Haskell terms, a feature that is very useful to build
  property-based tests using `QuickCheck`.

  The package contains thorough tests, including tests of `STM` against the
  original specification (as described in [Composable Memory
  Transactions](https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/stm/stm.pdf)
  and its `GHC` implementation.  This can be seen in both ways: as a check that
  our implementation matches the specification and the `GHC` implementation, but
  also the other way around: that `GHC`s `STM` implementation meets the
  specification.
