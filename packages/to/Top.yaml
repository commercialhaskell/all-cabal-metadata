description: |-
  At its most general, Top is a framework for constructing abstract interpretations
  which focuses on giving good feedback on why an abstract interpretation does not give
  any useful information. In a mathematical notation this is usually made explicit by
  returning the top element of a (complete) lattice. This is also one of the reasons
  for the name of the project.
