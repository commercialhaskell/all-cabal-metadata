description: |-
  Directed acyclic graphs can be sorted topographically.
  Existence of topographic ordering allows writing many graph algorithms efficiently.
  And many graphs, e.g. most dependency graphs are acyclic!

  There are some algorithms built-in: dfs, transpose, transitive closure,
  transitive reduction...
  Some algorithms even become not-so-hard to implement, like a longest path!
