  # token-search

  This is a library for efficient substring detection across a codebase.

  ## Motivation

  [Unused] leverages [ctags]' token generation in conjunction with a tool to
  search the file system (either [ripgrep] or [The Silver Searcher]).

  During execution, Unused shells out from Haskell for each unique token and
  searches the appropriate files for each token. This means each file searched is
  searched thousands of times each run, which takes a significant amount of time.

  [Unused]: https://unused.codes/
  [ctags]: https://ctags.io/
  [ripgrep]: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
  [The Silver Searcher]: https://geoff.greer.fm/ag/

  ## Approach

  Instead of searching each file git tracks for each of potentially thousands of
  tokens, `token-search` processes each file once.

  With the tokens:

  ```
  rem
  or
  lo
  ```

  and the text:

  ```
  lorem ipsum
  dolor sit amet
  ```

  `token-search` then:

  1. Builds a trie with the three tokens
  2. Iterates over each character in the text, while also:
     * creating a new copy of the trie
     * adding the created trie to a list of all non-terminated tries
     * walks each trie by the character
     * maintains a list of terminal nodes as tries are walked
     * increments a terminal node count for tokens as they're encountered
