description: ! "The usual finite map type (`Map` from `Data.Map`) is not an applicative
  functor, as it doesn't have a pure.\nConsequently, it's also not a monad.\nOn the
  other hand, we can decompose `Map` into two parts: a *total* map, and `Maybe`, i.e.,\n\n
  \   type Map k v = TMap k (Maybe v)\n\nThe type `TMap` of total maps does have `Applicative`
  and `Monad` instances, and hence this hypothetically rebuilt `Map` would as well.\n\nThe
  idea for `TMap` is introduced in the paper [*Denotational design with type class
  morphisms*](http://conal.net/papers/type-class-morphisms/).\nThe meaning `Map k
  v` is given by its semantic function\n\n    (!) :: Map k v -> (k -> v)\n\nThe type
  class morphism (TCM) principle then exactly dictates the meanings of several class
  instances for `TMap`, including `Functor`, `Applicative`, `Monad`, and `Monoid`.\nFor
  instance, `(!)` must be a monoid (homo)morphism, i.e.,\n\n    (!) mempty == mempty\n
  \   (!) (s `mappend` t) == (!) s `mappend` (!) t\n\nThe current implementation of
  `TMap` is via `Data.Map`.\n"
