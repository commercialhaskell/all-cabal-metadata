  # Revision history for toml-parser

  ## 2.0.0.0

  * Pervasive annotations on the values added to allow for detailed
    positional error reporting throughout parsing and validation.
  * Replace uses of String with Text in the Value type and throughout
    the API
  * Reorganized almost all of the modules to minimize imports that upstream
    packages will actually need.

  ## 1.3.3.0

  * Added `IsString Value` instance.
  * Addded helpers for `runMatcher` for ignoring and failing on warning
    `runMatcherIgnoreWarn` and `runMatcherFatalWarn`

  ## 1.3.2.0

  * Added `Toml.Generic` to make instances easily derivable via DerivingVia.
  * Added GHC.Generics support for switching between product types and TOML arrays.

  ## 1.3.1.3

  * Bugfix: Previous fix admitted some invalid inline tables - these are now rejected

  ## 1.3.1.2

  * Bugfix: In some cases overlapping keys in inline tables could throw an exception
    instead instead of returning the proper semantic error value.

  ## 1.3.1.1

  * Ensure years are rendered zero-padded

  ## 1.3.1.0

  * Added `Toml.Semantics.Ordered` for preserving input TOML orderings
  * Added support for pretty-printing multi-line strings

  ## 1.3.0.0  --  2023-07-16

  * Make more structured error messages available in the low-level modules.
    Consumers of the `Toml` module can keep getting simple error strings
    and users interested in structured errors can run the different layers
    independently to get more detailed error reporting.
  * `FromValue` and `ToValue` instances for: `Ratio`, `NonEmpty`, `Seq`
  * Add `FromKey` and `ToKey` for allowing codecs for `Map` to use various key types.

  ## 1.2.1.0  --  2023-07-12

  * Added `Toml.Pretty.prettyTomlOrdered` to allow user-specified section ordering.
  * Added `FromValue` and `ToValue` instances for `Text`
  * Added `reqKeyOf` and `optKeyOf` for easier custom matching without `FromValue` instances.

  ## 1.2.0.0  --  2023-07-09

  * Remove `FromTable` class. This class existed for things that could be
    matched specifically from tables, which is what the top-level values
    always are. However `FromValue` already handles this, and both classes
    can fail, so having the extra level of checking doesn't avoid failure.
    It does, however, create a lot of noise generating instances. Note that
    `ToTable` continues to exist because `toTable` isn't allowed to fail,
    and when serializing to TOML syntax you can only serialize top-level
    tables.
  * Extracted `Toml.FromValue.Matcher` and `Toml.FromValue.ParseTable` into
    their own modules.
  * Add `pickKey`, `liftMatcher`, `inKey`, `inIndex`, `parseTableFromValue` to `Toml.FromValue`
  * Replace `genericFromTable` with `genericParseTable`. The intended way to
    derive a `FromValue` instance is now to write:

    ```haskell
    instance FromValue T where fromValue = parseTableFromValue genericParseTable
    ```

  ## 1.1.1.0  --  2023-07-03

  * Add support for GHC 8.10.7 and 9.0.2

  ## 1.1.0.0  --  2023-07-03

  * Add Toml.FromValue.Generic and Toml.ToValue.Generic
  * Add Alternative instance to Matcher and support multiple error messages in Result
  * Add Data and Generic instances for Value

  ## 1.0.1.0  -- 2023-07-01

  * Add ToTable and ToValue instances for Map
  * Refine error messages
  * More test coverage

  ## 1.0.0.0  -- 2023-06-29

  * Complete rewrite including 1.0.0 compliance and pretty-printing.

  ## 0.1.0.0  -- 2017-05-04

  * First version.

  # TOML Parser

  This package implements a validating parser for [TOML 1.0.0](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0).

  This package uses an [alex](https://haskell-alex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)-generated
  lexer and [happy](https://haskell-happy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)-generated parser.

  It also provides a pair of classes for serializing into and out of TOML.

  ## Package Structure

      classDef important font-weight:bold;

      TOML:::important --> ApplicationTypes:::important : decode
      ApplicationTypes --> TOML : encode
      TOML --> [Token]: Lexer
      [Token] --> [Expr]: Parser
      [Expr] --> Table : Semantics
      Table --> ApplicationTypes : FromValue
      ApplicationTypes --> Table : ToValue
      Table --> TOML : Pretty
  ```

  Most users will only need to import **Toml** or **Toml.Schema**. Other top-level
  modules are for low-level hacking on the TOML format itself. All modules below
  these top-level modules are exposed to provide direct access to library implementation
  details.

  - **Toml** - Basic encoding and decoding TOML
  - **Toml.Schema** - TOML schemas for application types
  - **Toml.Semantics** - Low-level semantic operations on TOML syntax
  - **Toml.Syntax** - Low-level parsing of text into TOML raw syntax

  ## Examples

  This file uses [markdown-unlit](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/markdown-unlit)
  to ensure that its code typechecks and stays in sync with the rest of the package.

  ```haskell
  {-# Language OverloadedStrings #-}
  import Data.Text (Text)
  import GHC.Generics (Generic)
  import QuoteStr (quoteStr)
  import Test.Hspec (Spec, hspec, it, shouldBe)
  import Toml
  import Toml.Schema

  main :: IO ()
  main = hspec (parses >> decodes >> encodes >> warns >> errors)
  ```

  ### Using the raw parser

  Consider this sample TOML text from the TOML specification.

  ```haskell
  fruitStr :: Text
  fruitStr = [quoteStr|
  ```

  ```toml
  [[fruits]]
  name = "apple"

  [fruits.physical]  # subtable
  color = "red"
  shape = "round"

  [[fruits.varieties]]  # nested array of tables
  name = "red delicious"

  [[fruits.varieties]]
  name = "granny smith"


  [[fruits]]
  name = "banana"

  [[fruits.varieties]]
  name = "plantain"
  ```

  ```haskell
  |]
  ```

  Parsing using this package generates the following unstructured value

  ```haskell
  parses :: Spec
  parses = it "parses" $
      forgetTableAnns <$> parse fruitStr
      `shouldBe`
      Right (table [
          ("fruits", List [
              Table (table [
                  ("name", Text "apple"),
                  ("physical", Table (table [
                      ("color", Text "red"),
                      ("shape", Text "round")])),
                  ("varieties", List [
                      Table (table [("name", Text "red delicious")]),
                      Table (table [("name", Text "granny smith")])])]),
              Table (table [
                  ("name", Text "banana"),
                  ("varieties", List [
                      Table (table [("name", Text "plantain")])])])])])
  ```

  ### Defining a schema

  We can define a schema for our TOML format in the form of instances of
  `FromValue`, `ToValue`, and `ToTable` in order to read TOML directly
  into structured data form. This example manually derives some of the
  instances as a demonstration.

  ```haskell
  newtype Fruits = Fruits { fruits :: [Fruit] }
      deriving (Eq, Show, Generic)
      deriving (ToTable, ToValue, FromValue) via GenericTomlTable Fruits

  data Fruit = Fruit { name :: String, physical :: Maybe Physical, varieties :: [Variety] }
      deriving (Eq, Show, Generic)
      deriving (ToTable, ToValue, FromValue) via GenericTomlTable Fruit

  data Physical = Physical { color :: String, shape :: String }
      deriving (Eq, Show, Generic)
      deriving (ToTable, ToValue, FromValue) via GenericTomlTable Physical

  newtype Variety = Variety String
      deriving (Eq, Show)

  instance FromValue Variety where
      fromValue = parseTableFromValue (Variety <$> reqKey "name")
  instance ToValue Variety where
      toValue = defaultTableToValue
  instance ToTable Variety where
      toTable (Variety x) = table ["name" .= x]

  ```

  We can run this example on the original value to deserialize it into domain-specific datatypes.

  ```haskell
  decodes :: Spec
  decodes = it "decodes" $
      decode fruitStr
      `shouldBe`
      Success [] (Fruits [
          Fruit
              "apple"
              (Just (Physical "red" "round"))
              [Variety "red delicious", Variety "granny smith"],
          Fruit "banana" Nothing [Variety "plantain"]])

  encodes :: Spec
  encodes = it "encodes" $
      show (encode (Fruits [Fruit
              "apple"
              (Just (Physical "red" "round"))
              [Variety "red delicious", Variety "granny smith"]]))
      `shouldBe` [quoteStr|
          [[fruits]]
          name = "apple"

          [fruits.physical]
          color = "red"
          shape = "round"

          [[fruits.varieties]]
          name = "red delicious"

          [[fruits.varieties]]
          name = "granny smith"|]
  ```

  ### Useful errors and warnings

  This package takes care to preserve source information as much as possible
  in order to provide useful feedback to users. These examples show a couple
  of the message that can be generated when things don't go perfectly.

  ```haskell
  warns :: Spec
  warns = it "warns" $
      decode [quoteStr|
          name = "simulated"
          typo = 10|]
      `shouldBe`
      Success
          ["2:1: unexpected key: typo in <top-level>"] -- warnings
          (Variety "simulated")

  errors :: Spec
  errors = it "errors" $
      decode [quoteStr|
          # Physical characteristics table
          color = "blue"
          shape = []|]
      `shouldBe`
      (Failure
          ["3:9: expected string but got array in shape"]
          :: Result String Physical)
  ```

  ## More Examples

  A demonstration of using this package at a more realistic scale
  can be found in [HieDemoSpec](test/HieDemoSpec.hs). The various unit
  test files demonstrate what you can do with this library and what
  outputs you can expect.
