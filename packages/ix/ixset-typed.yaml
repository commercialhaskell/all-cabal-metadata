changelog: |
  0.4.0.1 (2018-10-01)
  ====================

  - containers-0.6 compatibility.

  0.4 (2018-03-18)
  ================

  * GHC 8.4 compatibility.

  * Drop compatibility with GHC 7. GHC 8.4 introduces `Semigroup` as a superclass
    for monoid, and `Semigroup` is not in `base` prior to GHC 8. To avoid
    a conditional interface or a dependency on the `semigroups` package, we drop
    compatibility with GHC 7. There are not other changes in this version, so
    `ixset-typed-0.3.1.1` remains usable with GHC 7.

  0.3.1.1 (2017-08-14)
  ====================

  * GHC 8.2 compatibility.

  0.3.1 (2016-06-21)
  ==================

  * GHC 8.0 compatibility.

  0.3 (2014-07-23)
  ================

  * `IxSet` internals are now more strict

  * The `empty` method of `Indexable` is now called `indices` and has a slightly
    different path; to migrate your code, if you were using Template Haskell,
    you probably do not have to change anything. Otherwise, wherever you have
    an instance of `Indexable` that looks like this

         instance Indexable MyIndexSet MyType where  -- OLD
           empty = mkEmpty ...

    change it to

         instance Indexable MyIndexSet MyType where  -- NEW
           indices = ixList ...


  0.2 (2014-04-06)
  ================

  * Add testsuite (which is a port of the ixset testsuite).

  * Cleaning up and documentation.

  * Add 'Foldable' and 'NFData' instances.


  0.1.4 (2014-04-03)
  ==================

  * Documentation.


  0.1.3 (2014-04-02)
  ==================

  * Export `IsIndexOf` class.


  0.1.2 (2014-04-02)
  ==================

  * Clean up export list.

  * Documentation.


  0.1.1 (2014-04-02)
  ==================

  * Clean up export list.

  * Documentation.


  0.1.0.0 (2014-03-31)
  ====================

  * Initial release.

description: |-
  This Haskell package provides a data structure of sets that are indexed
  by potentially multiple indices.

  Sets can be created, modified, and queried in various ways.

  The package is a variant of the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ixset ixset>
  package. The ixset package makes use
  of run-time type information to find a suitable index on a query, resulting
  in possible run-time errors when no suitable index exists. In ixset-typed,
  the types of all indices available or tracked in the type system.
  Thus, ixset-typed should be safer to use than ixset, but in turn requires
  more GHC extensions.

  At the moment, the two packages are relatively compatible. As a consequence
  of the more precise types, a few manual tweaks are necessary when switching
  from one to the other, but the interface is mostly the same.
