changelog: ! "0.4.0.1 (2018-10-01)\n====================\n\n- containers-0.6 compatibility.\n\n0.4
  (2018-03-18)\n================\n\n* GHC 8.4 compatibility.\n\n* Drop compatibility
  with GHC 7. GHC 8.4 introduces `Semigroup` as a superclass\n  for monoid, and `Semigroup`
  is not in `base` prior to GHC 8. To avoid\n  a conditional interface or a dependency
  on the `semigroups` package, we drop\n  compatibility with GHC 7. There are not
  other changes in this version, so\n  `ixset-typed-0.3.1.1` remains usable with GHC
  7.\n\n0.3.1.1 (2017-08-14)\n====================\n\n* GHC 8.2 compatibility.\n\n0.3.1
  (2016-06-21)\n==================\n\n* GHC 8.0 compatibility.\n\n0.3 (2014-07-23)\n================\n\n*
  `IxSet` internals are now more strict\n\n* The `empty` method of `Indexable` is
  now called `indices` and has a slightly\n  different path; to migrate your code,
  if you were using Template Haskell,\n  you probably do not have to change anything.
  Otherwise, wherever you have\n  an instance of `Indexable` that looks like this\n\n
  \      instance Indexable MyIndexSet MyType where  -- OLD\n         empty = mkEmpty
  ...\n\n  change it to\n\n       instance Indexable MyIndexSet MyType where  -- NEW\n
  \        indices = ixList ...\n\n\n0.2 (2014-04-06)\n================\n\n* Add testsuite
  (which is a port of the ixset testsuite).\n\n* Cleaning up and documentation.\n\n*
  Add 'Foldable' and 'NFData' instances.\n\n\n0.1.4 (2014-04-03)\n==================\n\n*
  Documentation.\n\n\n0.1.3 (2014-04-02)\n==================\n\n* Export `IsIndexOf`
  class.\n\n\n0.1.2 (2014-04-02)\n==================\n\n* Clean up export list.\n\n*
  Documentation.\n\n\n0.1.1 (2014-04-02)\n==================\n\n* Clean up export
  list.\n\n* Documentation.\n\n\n0.1.0.0 (2014-03-31)\n====================\n\n* Initial
  release.\n"

description: ! 'This Haskell package provides a data structure of sets that are indexed

  by potentially multiple indices.


  Sets can be created, modified, and queried in various ways.


  The package is a variant of the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ixset ixset>

  package. The ixset package makes use

  of run-time type information to find a suitable index on a query, resulting

  in possible run-time errors when no suitable index exists. In ixset-typed,

  the types of all indices available or tracked in the type system.

  Thus, ixset-typed should be safer to use than ixset, but in turn requires

  more GHC extensions.


  At the moment, the two packages are relatively compatible. As a consequence

  of the more precise types, a few manual tweaks are necessary when switching

  from one to the other, but the interface is mostly the same.'
