description: "# animate\nAnimation for sprites\n\n---\n\n`animate` is a general purpose
  animation library as it's used for graphical 2D and terminal games.\nEach key of
  an animation are left opened to custom types.\nThis is in an effort to avoid using
  numbers or strings as indices and be reusable.\n\n---\n\n[Example using SDL2](https://github.com/jxv/animate-sdl2/tree/master/example)
  (and includes loading from \"Paths\")\n\n---\n\n## Sprite Information\n\nSprite
  loaders are provided but aren't required.\nWhile the loaders are opininated compared
  to the rest of the library, they aren't bound to any graphics library.\nAnd many
  pieces are left exposed if you wish piece together some other variation.\n\nThe
  YAML (and JSON) files describe very typical sprite information:\n\n```yaml\n# File
  path of spritesheet\nimage: \"dino.png\"\n\n# Colorkey for transparency\n# Optional:
  It's a tuple of [Red, Green, Blue] between 0-255 values.\nalpha: [255, 0, 255]\n\n#
  Clip is a portion of the sprite sheet\n# Optional: The offset is optional.\n# [x,
  y, width, height]\n# [x, y, width, height, offsetX, offsetY] \n\nclips:\n# Idle
  \                     # index\n- [  0, 0, 48, 48]          # 0\n- [ 48, 0, 48, 48]
  \         # 1\n- [ 96, 0, 48, 48, 24, 42]  # 2\n- [144, 0, 48, 48, 24, 42]  # 3\n\n#
  Move\n- [192, 0, 48, 48, 24, 42]  # 4\n- [240, 0, 48, 48, 24, 42]  # 5\n- [288,
  0, 48, 48, 24, 42]  # 6\n- [336, 0, 48, 48, 24, 42]  # 7\n- [384, 0, 48, 48, 24,
  42]  # 8\n- [432, 0, 48, 48, 24, 42]  # 9\n\n# And so on...\n\n# Animation frames
  are defined by the clip indices and delay time for each clip\nanimations:\n  Idle:\n
  \ # [index, delay (seconds)]\n  - [0, 0.2]\n  - [1, 0.2]\n  - [2, 0.2]\n  - [3,
  0.2]\n\n  Move:\n  - [4, 0.01]\n  - [5, 0.01]\n  - [6, 0.01]\n  - [7, 0.01]\n  -
  [8, 0.01]\n  - [9, 0.01]\n\n  # And so on...\n```"
