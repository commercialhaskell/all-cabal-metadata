description: |-
  A combinator library to improve the building of anti-quoters.
  Especially aimed at removing copy-and-paste programming from
  their definition. Other antiquoting related features could be
  included in the future.

  The modules are

  * "Language.Haskell.AntiQuoter.Base" basic types for building
  antiquoters. It also contains the most detailed example of
  the basic usage.

  * "Language.Haskell.AntiQuoter.ExpPat" making antiquoters which
  can antiquote both expressions and patters. Therefore only
  one antiquoter has to be defined in stead of two.

  * "Language.Haskell.AntiQuoter.Combinators" more useful
  combinators to use with the functions from
  "Language.Haskell.AntiQuoter.ExpPat".
