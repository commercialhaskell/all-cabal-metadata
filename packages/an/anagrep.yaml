  A Haskell library for matching permutations of regular expressions: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/anagrep

  And a command-line interface, useful for puzzle solving (e.g., which English word has one 'p', one 'q', and four vowels?):

  Usage: anagrep REGEXP [FILE]...
  Print lines in each FILE (or stdin) for which some permutation (anagram)
  matches the given REGEXP.  REGEXP is a restricted regular expression that can
  contain the following patterns:
    Character matches
      x         single literal character
      [aein-z]  character set (any listed character)
      [^a-mou]  negated character set (any character not listed)
      .         any single character
      \x        escape single literal character (no special meanings)
    Repeat modifiers - may only be applied to characters (above)
      {N,M}     repeat character N-M times
      {N,}      repeat character at least N times
      {N}       equivalent to {N,N}
      ?         equivalent to {0,1}
      *         equivalent to {0,}
      +         equivalent to {1,}
    Combination
      XY        concatenation matches pattern X and Y in either order
      X|Y       alternation matches pattern X or Y
      (X)       grouping (only useful for alternation - note that successive
                grouped alternations involve a cross-product expansion and may
                be slow)
  Other regular expression features are not currently supported.  Matching is
  always done on entire lines (like grep -x).

  Example: anagrep 'pq[aeiou]{4}' /usr/share/dict/words
    > opaque

  Flags:
    -b    treat input as raw byte sequence (uses locale encoding by default)
    -i    ignore case distinctions in patterns and data
