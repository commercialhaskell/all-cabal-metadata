description: |-
  Given a regular expression, determine if it matches any permutation of a given string.  For example, @"lt[aeiou]*"@ would match all strings with one \'l\', one \'t\', and vowels (like \"elate\", \"tail\", \"tl\", etc.).
  Regular expression parsing is based on <//hackage.haskell.org/package/regex-tdfa regex-tdfa> and generally follows those semantics, but not all regular expression features are supported.  For example, repeat modifiers cannot be applied to groups (such as "(abc)*").
  The goal is for matching to be fairly efficient in most cases, given that this problem is NP-complete.
